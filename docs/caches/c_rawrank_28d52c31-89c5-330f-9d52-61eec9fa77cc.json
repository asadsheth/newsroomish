Given that we've made mistaken assumptions in the past by presuming that the unseen Universe contained substances that simply weren't there, from the aether to phlogiston, isn't it a greater leap-of-faith to assume that 95% of the Universe is some invisible, unseen form of energy than it is to assume there's just a flaw in the law of gravity?

If the weather conditions are in our\u00a0favour and the moon isn't too bright, there's a chance you'll be able to see the shooting stars in action. Here is our guide to the must-see meteor showers of 2018 \u2013\u00a0including the spectacular Lyrids shower which will peak on the morning of April 22 \u2013\u00a0as well as where and how to see them. What exactly is a meteor shower? A meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through the debris stream occupying the orbit of a comet - or, in simpler terms,\u00a0when a number of meteors flash across the sky from roughly the same point. Meteors are\u00a0sometimes called shooting stars, although they\u00a0actually have nothing to do with stars. If you're lucky you could see\u00a0up to 100 meteors or 'shooting stars'\u00a0every hour on December 13\/14. Credit: PETE LAWRENCE Perspective makes meteor showers\u00a0appear to emanate from a single point in the sky known as the shower radiant. A typical meteor results from a particle the size of a grain of sand vaporising in Earth\u2019s atmosphere when it enters at 134,000mph. Something larger than a grape will produce a fireball and this is often accompanied by a persistent afterglow known as a meteor train. This is a column of ionised gas slowly fading from view as it loses energy. Meteor, meteorid or meteroite? Let's get this straight. A meteor is a meteoroid \u2013 or a particle broken off an asteroid or comet orbiting the Sun \u2013 that burns up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere\u00a0creating the effect of a \"shooting star\". Meteoroids that reach the Earth's surface without disintegrating are called meteorites. Meteors are mostly pieces of comet dust and ice no larger than a grain of rice. Meteorites are principally rocks broken off asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and can weigh as much as 60 tonnes. They can be\u00a0\"stony\", made up of minerals rich in silicon and oxygen, \"iron\", consisting mainly of iron and nickel, or \"stony-iron\", a combination of the two. The Geminids meteor shower in Vladivostok, Russia in December 2017 Credit: Yuri Smityuk Scientists think about 1,000 tons to more than 10,000 tons of material from meteors falls on Earth each day, but it's mostly dust-like grains, according to Nasa, and they pose no threat to Earth. There are only two incidents recorded where people reported being injured by a meteorite, including one\u00a0in 1954 when a woman was bruised by a meteorite weighing eight pounds after it fell through her roof.\u00a0 When is the next meteor shower? The annual Lyrid meteor shower takes places annually\u00a0between April 16 and April 25. In 2018, it will peak on the morning of April 22, with the greatest number of meteors falling during the few hours before dawn. With no moon, stargazers might be able to see between 10 and 20 Lyrid meteors per hour at the shower's peak.\u00a0 Lyrid meteors are typically as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper, but some are much more intense, even brighter than Venus, the brightest object in the night sky after the moon. Called \"Lyrid fireballs\", these cast shadows for a split second and leave behind smokey debris trails that linger for minutes. Tim Peake space pictures What causes the Lyrid meteor shower? The ionised gas in the meteors'\u00a0trail burns up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere, creates the glow which can be seen streaking across the night sky.\u00a0 The shower occurs as the Earth passes through the dust left over from Comet Thatcher (C\/186 G1), which makes a full orbit of the sun once every 415 years (which is why there are no photographs of it). Flakes of comet dust, most no bigger than grains of sand, strike Earth's atmosphere traveling 49 km\/s (110,000 mph) and disintegrate as streaks of light. Comet Thatcher last visited the inner solar system in 1861 -\u00a0before the widespread use of photography\u00a0\u00a0- and isn\u2019t expected to return until the year 2276. How did the Lyrids get its name? The shower radiates out from the direction of the star Vega, the brightest light in the constellation Lyra the Harp, from which it takes its name. Vega is a brilliant blue-white star about three times wider than our Sun and 25 light years away. The Lyrids radiating from the vicinity of the blue star Lyra Credit: earthsky.org You might remember\u00a0Vega being mentioned in Carl Sagan's movie\u00a0Contact - it was the source of alien radio transmissions to Earth. When were the Lyrids first observed and recorded? The earliest sightings of the Lyrid meteor shower go back 2,700 years and are among the oldest of known meteor showers. In the year 687 BC the ancient Chinese observed the meteors and recorded them in the ancient Zuo Zhan chronicles saying:\u00a0 \"On the 4th month in the summer in the year of\u00a0x\u012bn-m\u01ceo\u00a0(of year 7 of King Zhuang of\u00a0Lu), at night, (the sky is so bright that some) fixed stars become invisible (because of the meteor shower); at midnight, stars fell like rain. That era of Chinese history\u00a0corresponds with what is now called the\u00a0Spring and Autumn Period\u00a0(about 771 to 476 BC). \u00a0Tradition associates this period\u00a0with the Chinese teacher and philosopher Confucius, one of the first to espouse the principle: \u201cDo not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.\u201d \u00a0 American observers saw an outburst of nearly 100 Lyrid meteors per hour in 1982. Around 100 meteors per hour were seen in Greece in 1922 and from Japan in 1945. 2018 | Major meteor showers Major meteor showers to look out for in 2018 The Quadrantid\u00a0meteor shower The\u00a0Quadrantids was\u00a0the first major meteor shower of 2018; it peaked at around 8pm on January 3\u00a0when between 10 and 60 meteors were\u00a0shooting per hour.\u00a0 It\u00a0had\u00a0a sharp peak, which means the best of the shower only lasted\u00a0a few hours - although it remained active until January 12th. First spotted in\u00a01825\u00a0by the Italian astronomer Antonio Brucalassi, astronomers suspect the shower originates from the comet\u00a0C\/1490 Y1, which was first observed 500 years ago by Japanese, Chinese and Korean astronomers. Why is it called Quadrantid? The Quadrantids appear to radiate from the extinct constellation Quadrans Muralis, which is now part of the\u00a0Bo\u00f6tes constellation and not far from the Big Dipper. Because of the constellation's position in the sky, the shower is often impossible to see in the Southern Hemisphere -\u00a0however there is a chance of spotting it up to 51 degrees south latitude. The best spots to see the display are in countries with high northern latitudes, like Norway, Sweden, Canada and Finland. The Perseid meteor shower The Perseids appear to originate from within the star constellation Perseus, hence the shower's name. The\u00a0shower occurs when Earth passes through the debris stream occupying the orbit of the comet Swift-Tuttle. The wonderfully named comet\u00a0is\u00a0the largest object known to repeatedly pass Earth (it's 16 miles wide).\u00a0It orbits the sun ever 133 years and each time it passes through the inner solar system\u00a0it warms up, releasing fresh comet material into its orbital\u00a0stream. The last time it was closest to the sun was in December 1992. It will be back again in July 2126.\u00a0 Perseid meteor radiant When can I see the Perseid meteor shower? The window for the next Perseid\u00a0meteor shower is from July 17 to August 24 2018. Stargazers stand a chance of seeing the shower at any point in this window, however the\u00a0peak will occur\u00a0around on August 13.\u00a0 The best time to take a look at the sky will be from about 1am BST in the Northern Hemisphere until the onset of dawn twilight. Peak rates of 150-200 meteors per hour were recorded in\u00a02016, but typical rates are about 80 meteors an hour streaking across the night sky, each leaving a trail. \u00a0 To see it, look at a height approximately two-thirds up the sky in any direction. If you want a recommendation, east through south offers some great background constellations in the early hours during August.\u00a0Look for the shower's \"radiant\" from the north-east corner of Perseus. The Orionid meteor shower The\u00a0Orionid\u00a0meteors appear every year, with showers producing around 20 meteors every hour. The shower is active throughout October until November 7, but\u00a0the best time to see it will be on October 20\u00a0between midnight and dawn, when the sky is darkest and the shower will be at its brightest. Tom Kerss, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich\u00a0said:\"If you can brave the cold, make a plan to stay out\u00a0and enjoy the thrill of seeing tiny flecks of Halley's Comet disintegrate at hypersonic speeds above your head.\" He advises finding a secluded spot and allowing the eyes to adjust to the darkness. Orionid meteors streak across the sky over Kula town of Manisa, Turkey on October 21, 2017 Credit: \u00a0Anadolu Agency Mr Kerss said: \"There's no advantage to using binoculars or a telescope, your eyes are the best tool available for spotting meteors, so relax and gaze up at the sky, and eventually your patience will be rewarded. \"Meteors can appear anywhere in the sky, though if you have to pick a direction, you might fare slightly better looking east.\" The meteoroids from Halley's Comet strike Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 148,000mph, (238,000kph) burning up in streaking flashes of light that can be seen with the naked eye. Orionid\u00a0meteors are known for their speed and brilliance, so if you persevere there's a good chance you'll see several bright 'shooting stars' zipping across the sky. The\u00a0Orionid Meteor Shower is one of two\u00a0meteor showers created by debris from Halley's Comet - the other is the Eta\u00a0Aquarids, which occurs in May. Unfortunately, Halley's Comet itself has not been visible from Earth since 1986. Why is it called Orionid? It's named Orionid because it appears to radiate\u00a0from the constellation Orion. Orion is one of the brightest and best known constellations and contains two of the 10 brightest stars in the sky Rigel and Betelgeuse, as well as the famous Orion's Belt.\u00a0 Orion's Belt is made up of three bright stars\u00a0quite close together almost in a straight line, and is\u00a0about 1,500 light years from us on Earth.\u00a0 Orion has been known since ancient times and is also referred to as Hunter thanks to Greek mythology. He is often seen in star maps facing Taurus, the bull. The Geminid meteor shower The Geminids are an annual meteor shower caused by the 3200 Phaethon asteroid. Its orbit brings it very close to the sun, causing its surface material to crumble and break off. The Earth passes through this space debris every December, which burns up as hits our atmosphere. These are the meteors visible in our sky. The Geminids were first observed relatively recently, in 1862, compared with the Perseids (36AD) and the Leonids (902AD). The meteor shower appears to come from a point in the constellation Gemini, hence its name. The Geminids meteor shower over Egersheld Cape on Russky Island in the Sea of Japan in December 2017 Credit: \u00a0Yuri Smityuk When\u00a0can it be seen? The next Geminid meteor shower can be seen from around December 4th to 17th, with peak activity from about 10pm on December 13th and into the early hours of the 14th.\u00a0 Sightings are possible around the world, but there's good news for Britons: the shower favours observers in the Northern Hemisphere over those in the Southern.\u00a0If you're lucky you could see\u00a0up to 100 meteors or 'shooting stars'\u00a0every hour. You can spot the meteors anywhere, but they will appear to come from the Gemini constellation. During December, it begins the evening in the east and moves across the sky to the west during the night. Find Orion's Belt - three bright stars positioned in a row - and then look above it and a little to the left. They will appear as streaks of light, and will sometimes arrive in bursts of two or three. They vary in colour, depending on their composition. An average of 120 meteors an hour - or two a minute - can be expected, or more during the 2am peak.

Look for a wide, open viewing area - perhaps a national park or large field on the side of a road - and make sure you concentrate your gaze towards the east. Meteor showers are unpredictable though, so prepare for the fact you might not see much. Choose a dark location away from stray lights and give yourself at least 20 minutes in total darkness to properly dark adapt.\u00a0 Britain has some wonderful stargazing locations, including three \"Dark Sky Reserves\" (Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Exmoor national parks) and Europe's largest \"Dark Sky Park\" (Northumberland National Park and the adjoining Kielder Water and Forest Park). best stargazing locations Galloway Forest Park:\u00a0Galloway is a couple of hours from Glasgow and an hour from Carlisle. The park's most popular spot for stargazing is Loch Trool. Exmoor and around:\u00a0Exmoor was granted International Dark-Sky Reserve status by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2011. Light pollution is managed to make the area more appealing to amateur astronomers. Romney Marsh:\u00a0Night once provided cover for smugglers known as Owlers, but today Romney Marsh offers celestial bounty, arching over a landscape adorned with the spires of ancient churches. Kielder:\u00a0Kielder Forest is officially the darkest place in England \u2013 250 square miles of wooded beauty where Northumberland brushes against Scotland. It has its own fabulous, modern, wood-clad observatory on the slopes of Black Fell above Kielder Water. North York Moors:\u00a0As well as stunning night skies, the North York Moors boast historic market towns such as Helmsley and Pickering, plus appealing coastal spots, including Scarborough and Whitby.","published_at":1520953815,"content_id":"c90d4a9c-7016-37ea-870a-7677fee4475f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/quadrantid-meteor-showers-watch-next-132234888.html","content_published_at":1520953725,"content_time":1520953725,"content_relative_time":7,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":7,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fa25aab4-de01-321d-b865-2b0ca05f8768","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-0fc5ac9d-136f-3951-ad66-8a27032c6fe3_a-fa25aab4-de01-321d-b865-2b0ca05f8768","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-0fc5ac9d-136f-3951-ad66-8a27032c6fe3_a-fa25aab4-de01-321d-b865-2b0ca05f8768","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/mu-space-targets-2020-launch-33j79bm","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"TechCrunch","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/mu-space-targets-2020-launch-133639032.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TMNBDnSPs87rdpYuLr2DwQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/techcrunch_350\/f2a14f0dd6e9e9bb39a387d46b5c8797","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/av_zLKCFZhmtlD0kZq8uQg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjY3O3c9MjUwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/techcrunch_350\/f2a14f0dd6e9e9bb39a387d46b5c8797","height":1667,"width":2500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/techcrunch_350\/f2a14f0dd6e9e9bb39a387d46b5c8797","imgw":2500,"imgh":1667,"title":"mu Space targets 2020 launch of first satellite aboard Blue Origin's New Glenn","summary":"Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket, the reusable launch vehicle created by Blue Origin to put people and large cargo into orbit, has a new confirmed payload for one of its first missions: mu Space.

The Moon moves through the sky night and day. Much of the time, the sunlight is so bright, we can't see the Moon during the day.

A molecular cloud is an interstellar cloud of dust, gas, and a variety of molecules ranging from molecular hydrogen (H2) to complex, carbon-containing organics. Molecular clouds hold most of the water in the universe, and serve as nurseries for newborn stars and their planets. Within these clouds, on the surfaces of tiny dust grains, hydrogen atoms link with oxygen to form water. Carbon joins with hydrogen to make methane. Nitrogen bonds with hydrogen to create ammonia.

The last blue moon was a spectacular sight, dubbed the\u00a0'super blue blood moon'.\u00a0Falling on January 31, it was the product of three different phenomena: it was a supermoon, a blue moon and a blood moon. While many said it was the first to be seen in 152 years, other contested the fact, leading to a division among scientists. Although there was no full moon in February, stargazers are in for a treat in March: as well as the first full moon on the night of March 1, we will see another full moon on March 31. As it is the second full moon of the month, it will be a blue moon\u00a0\u2013 the second of 2018. The moon is the largest and brightest object in our night sky and has enchanted and\u00a0inspired mankind for centuries. Blue moons\u00a0are a rare breed, but full moons can be admired every month.\u00a0Here is everything you need to know about Earth's only natural satellite, from all its different names to how it was formed. Super blue blood moon, in pictures How often does a full moon occur? Afull moon occurs every 29.5 days and is when the Moon is completely illuminated by the Sun's rays. It occurs when Earth is directly aligned\u00a0between the Sun and the Moon.\u00a0 Why do full moons have names? The early Native Americans didn't record time using months of the Julian or Gregorian calendar. Instead tribes\u00a0gave\u00a0each full moon a nickname to keep track of the seasons and lunar months. Most of the names relate to an activity or an event that took place at the time in each\u00a0location.\u00a0However, it\u00a0wasn't a uniform system and tribes\u00a0tended to name and count moons differently. Some, for example, counted four seasons a year\u00a0while others counted five. Others defined a year as 12 moons, while others said there were\u00a013. Colonial Americans adopted some of the moon names and applied them to their own calendar system which is why they're still in existence today, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac. January: Wolf Moon This moon was named because villagers used to hear packs of wolves howling in hunger around this time of the year.\u00a0Its other name is the Old Moon. This January there are\u00a0two Wolf Moons - and stargazers will be in for a treat as both will be supermoons. When two moons occur in one month, the second is called a blue moon. While blue moons typically occur\u00a0only once every two to three years, this year we will be treated to two moons - the second appearing at the end of March. The night following the first full moon of the month saw the Quadrantid meteor shower light up the skies. When? January 2 and January 31 February:\u00a0Snow Moon Snow moon is named after the white stuff because historically it's always been the snowiest month in America. It's also traditionally\u00a0referred to as the Hunger Moon, because hunting was very difficult in snowy conditions.\u00a0 However this year there won't be a Snow Moon - with a full moon occurring at the end of January and another at the beginning of March, we won't see one light up the skies during the year's shortest month. When?\u00a0There will be no full moon this month The full Snow Moon appears red above London's Albert bridge and Battersea Bridge in 2012 Credit: Anthony Devlin March: Worm Moon As temperatures warm, earthworm casts begin to appear and birds begin finding food. It's also known as\u00a0Sap Moon, Crow Moon and Lenten Moon. There will be two moons this March, one at the start of the month and one at the end. As in January, the second moon of the month is called a blue moon. The second\u00a0moon of the month is important because it is used to fix the date of Easter, which is always the Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox.\u00a0This year, that moon\u00a0appears on Saturday March 31, which means Easter Sunday falls the day after, on April 1. When? March 1\u00a0and 31 April:\u00a0Pink Moon April's full moon is known as the Pink Moon, but don't be fooled into thinking it will turn pink. It's actually named after pink wildflowers, which appear\u00a0in the US and Canada in early spring.\u00a0 This moon is also known as Egg Moon, due to spring egg-laying season. Some coastal tribes referred\u00a0to it as Fish Moon because it appeared at the same time as the shad swimming upstream.\u00a0 When? April 30 May: Flower Moon Spring has officially sprung by the time\u00a0May arrives, and flowers and colourful blooms dot the landscape. This moon is also known as\u00a0Corn Planting Moon, as crops are sown in time for harvest, or Bright Moon because this full moon is known to be one of the brightest.\u00a0Some people refer to it as Milk Moon. When? \u00a0May 29 June: Strawberry Moon This moon is named after the\u00a0beginning of the strawberry picking season.\u00a0It's other names are Rose Moon, Hot Moon, or Hay Moon as hay is typically harvested around now. This moon appears in the same month as\u00a0the summer solstice, the longest day of the year (June 21)\u00a0in which we\u00a0can enjoy\u00a0approximately 17 hours of daylight. When? June 28 The so-called 'Strawberry Moon' rises behind Glastonbury Tor on in June 2016.\u00a0 Credit: Matt Cardy\/Getty Images July: Thunder Moon Named due to the prevalence of summer thunder storms. It's sometimes referred to as the Full Buck Moon because at this time of the year\u00a0a buck's antlers are fully grown.\u00a0 When? July 27 August: Sturgeon Moon Tribes in North America typically caught Sturgeon during this month, but also it is when grain and corn were gathered so is also referred to as Grain Moon.\u00a0 This moon appears in the same month as the Perseid\u00a0meteor shower. When? August 26 September:\u00a0Harvest Moon The Harvest Moon is the name given to the first full moon that takes place closest to the Autumn equinox, which this year will come on September 23. The Harvest Moon arrived\u00a0late last year, on October 5\u00a0- it normally rises in September. It was during September that most of the crops were harvested ahead of the autumn and this moon would give light to farmers so they could carry on working longer in the evening. Some tribes also called it the Barley Moon, the Full Corn Moon\u00a0or Fruit Moon.\u00a0 When? September 25 October: Hunter's Moon As people planned ahead for the cold months ahead, the October moon came to signify the ideal time for hunting game, which were becoming fatter from eating falling grains. This moon is also\u00a0known as the travel moon and the dying grass moon. When? October 24 November: Frost\u00a0Moon The first of the winter frosts historically begin to take their toll around now and winter begins to bite, leading to this month's moon moniker. It is\u00a0also known as the Beaver Moon. When?November 23 December: Cold Moon Nights are long and dark and winter's grip tightens, hence this Moon's name. With Christmas just a few weeks away, it's also referred to as Moon before Yule\u00a0and Long Nights Moon. When? December 22 Clouds clear to allow a view of the final full moon of the year, a so-called 'Cold Moon' on December 13 2016 in Cornwall. Credit: Matt Cardy\/Getty Images Once in a blue moon Does this well-known phrase have anything to do with the moon? Well, yes it does. We use it to refer to something happening\u00a0very rarely and a blue moon is a rare occurrence. It's the name\u00a0given to a\u00a0second full moon that occurs in a single calendar month and this\u00a0typically occurs only once every two to three years. There's lots of other moons, too: Full moon:\u00a0We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the night at night. Harvest moon: The\u00a0full moon closest to the autumn equinox. Black moon:\u00a0Most experts agree that this\u00a0refers to the second new moon in a calendar month.\u00a0The last black moon was at the start of October 2016 and the\u00a0next one\u00a0is expected in 2019. Blue moon:\u00a0A phenomenon that occurs when there is a second full moon in one calendar month.\u00a0Joe Rao\u00a0from space.com\u00a0explains: \"A second full moon in a single calendar month is sometimes called a blue moon. A black moon is supposedly the flip side of a blue moon; the second new moon in a single calendar month.\" Supermoon\u00a0is seen behind the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, in May 2012. Credit: AP Photo\/Victor R. Caivano The infrequent nature of this lunar event led to the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" to signify a rare occurrence. It does not actually mean the moon will be blue. Blood moon: Also known as a\u00a0supermoon lunar eclipse. It's\u00a0when\u00a0the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a\u00a0rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. \u00a0There was one in the UK in September 2015, and before that in 1982\u00a0but the next one won't be until 2033.\u00a0 Strawberry moon: A rare event when there's a full moon on the same day as the summer solstice. It happened in June 2016 for the first time since 1967 when\u00a017 hours of sunlight gave way to a bright moonlit sky. Despite the name, the moon does appear pink or red. The romantic label was coined by the Algonquin tribes of North America who believed June\u2019s full moon signalled the beginning of the strawberry picking season. What is a supermoon? Ever looked\u00a0up at the night sky to see a full\u00a0moon so close you could almost touch it? Well you've probably\u00a0spotted a supermoon. The impressive sight\u00a0happens\u00a0when a full moon is at the point in its orbit that brings it closest to Earth. To us Earth-lings,\u00a0it\u00a0appears\u00a030 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger to the naked eye.\u00a0 How a supermoon is generated Supermoon is not an astrological term though. It's scientific\u00a0name is actually\u00a0Perigee Full Moon, but supermoon is more catchy\u00a0and is used by the media to describe our celestial neighbour when it gets up close. Astrologer\u00a0Richard Nolle first\u00a0came up with the term supermoon and he defined it as \"\u2026 a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90 per cent\u00a0of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit\", according to earthsky.org. How many supermoons are there\u00a0in 2018? There are two full moon supermoons this year, both taking place in the first month of the year. The first appeared\u00a0on January 2 and the second will appear on January 31. As it will be the second moon of the month, the latter moon is also known as a blue moon. There will also be two new moon supermoons in 2018: one on July 13 and another on August 11.\u00a0Unfortunately, stargazers were unable to see these moons as new moons are generally obscured by the light of the sun. Last year we were lucky enough to have four supermoons. The first three -\u00a0April 26, May 25,\u00a0June 24 - were new moons.\u00a0 The fourth supermoon of 2017 appeared on December 3\u00a0and was a full moon supermoon. This will be a full moon supermoon. In fact, it's the first of three full moon supermoons in a row.\u00a0 Supermoon rises over Auckland, New Zealand in August 2014. Credit: Simon Runting\/REX What do I look for? Head outside at sunset\u00a0when the moon is closest to the horizon and marvel at its size.\u00a0As well as being closer and brighter, the moon (clouds permitting) should also\u00a0look orange and red in colour. Why? Well, as moonlight passes through the thicker section of the\u00a0atmosphere, light\u00a0particles at the red end of the spectrum don't scatter as easily as light at the blue end of the spectrum. So when the moon looks red, you're just looking at red light that wasn't scattered.\u00a0As the moon gets higher in the sky, it returns to its normal white\/yellow\u00a0colour.\u00a0 Will the\u00a0tides be larger? Yes. When full or new moons are\u00a0especially close to Earth, it leads to higher tides. Tides are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun.\u00a0Because the sun and moon go through different alignments, this affects the size of the tides. Tell me more about the moon The moon\u00a0is\u00a04.6 billion years old and was formed between 30-50 million years after the solar system. It is smaller than Earth -\u00a0about the same size as Pluto in fact. Its\u00a0surface area is\u00a0less than the surface\u00a0area of Asia - about 14.6 million square miles\u00a0according to space.com Gravity on the moon is only 1\/6 of that found on Earth. The moon is not round, but is egg-shaped with the large end pointed towards Earth. It would take 135 days to drive by car to the moon at 70 mph\u00a0(or nine years to walk). The moon has\u00a0\"moonquakes\"\u00a0caused by the gravitational pull of Earth. Experts believe the moon has a molten core, just like Earth.\u00a0 How was the Moon formed? How the Moon was formed Man on the Moon Only 12 people have ever walked on the moon and they were all American men, including (most famously) Neil Armstrong who was the first in 1969 on the Apollo II mission.\u00a0 The last time mankind sent someone to the moon was in 1972 when\u00a0Gene Cernan visited on the Apollo 17 mission. Although\u00a0Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon,\u00a0Buzz Aldrin was the first man to urinate there. While millions watched the moon landing on live television, Aldrin was forced to go in a\u00a0tube fitted inside his space suit.

It was the smell of moon-dust brought in on their boots. The mineral, armalcolite, discovered during the first moon landing and later found at various locations on Earth, was named after the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil ARMstrong, Buzz ALdrin and Michael COLlins. An estimated 600 million people watched the Apollo 11 landing live on television, a world record until 750 million people watched the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. One of President Nixon\u2019s speechwriters had prepared an address entitled: \u201cIn Event of Moon Disaster\u201d. It began: \u201cFate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay to rest in peace.\u201d If the launch from the Moon had failed, Houston was to close down communications and leave Armstrong and Aldrin to their death.\u00a0 How the Daily Telegraph reported Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon in 1969","published_at":1520533093,"content_id":"d7311fd0-92d0-3617-bd85-fbf333b66474","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/complete-list-every-full-moon-170622860.html","content_published_at":1520424283,"content_time":1520424283,"content_relative_time":154,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":154,"comment_relative_time":154,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"95541eb2-542d-3adb-98ea-3628eaa6cd0a","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-1a54fa36-d059-3909-925f-0f339c234ec4_a-95541eb2-542d-3adb-98ea-3628eaa6cd0a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-1a54fa36-d059-3909-925f-0f339c234ec4_a-95541eb2-542d-3adb-98ea-3628eaa6cd0a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/astronomers-study-neptunes-largest-moon-66wmuce","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Medium","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/medium.com\/extremetech-access\/astronomers-to-study-neptunes-largest-moon-with-spacecraft-distant-star-bf9b626bd798","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GCEd7429dBuKjM9DdNCHzA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PRpK6QKnmLFzsdcE71j7Hw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_95541eb2-542d-3adb-98ea-3628eaa6cd0a--1452514743.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NbT3Qm5sw1kZyR34dyeoOA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PRpK6QKnmLFzsdcE71j7Hw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_95541eb2-542d-3adb-98ea-3628eaa6cd0a--1452514743.jpeg","height":576,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PRpK6QKnmLFzsdcE71j7Hw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_95541eb2-542d-3adb-98ea-3628eaa6cd0a--1452514743.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":576,"title":"Astronomers to Study Neptune's Largest Moon With Spacecraft, Distant Star","summary":"A stupendously rare astronomical event occurred last year when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, passed in front of a distant star. The extreme distances involved made this event almost impossible to observe, but the European Space Agency (ESA) helped astronomers pin down exactly where they needed to be to observe it. Thanks to the Gaia spacecraft, researchers managed to capture a \u201ccentral flash\u201d from Triton, carrying important hints about conditions on the moon. Triton is large for a moon at more than 20 percent the diameter of Earth. It has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen and methane, but we've never been able to study it in detail.

In late 2017 the Chinese government offered a very rough forecast of when the satellite could collide with our planet, and now it's looking more and more like March might be the month when it happens. According to the latest information from the European Space Agency, which is tracking the object's movement, the space station is now expected to come tumbling down somewhere between March 24th and April 19th. Scientists believe that it will reenter Earth's atmosphere between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south latitudes. That's a pretty imprecise estimate, but the ESA says it's more likely that the object will land somewhere in the northern latitudes, meaning the northern US, parts of Spain, Portugal, Greece, China, much of the Middle East, and a handful of other countries. The space station, whose name means \"Heavenly Palace,\" will be subjected to the full brunt of friction from Earth's atmosphere and, thankfully, will be incinerated almost completely before any remaining debris finally lands on the surface. However, it's still possible that the spacecraft could cause some problems if it lands on hard ground, especially in a populated area. Some of the material on board the space station is indeed toxic, including chemicals used in rocket fuel, and China has noted that if that material finds its way to the ground it could be hazardous to anyone who stumbles upon it. That being said, the odds of any debris actually landing near you or, even worse, striking you is incredibly small. Space debris experts put the chances of being struck by space debris at around a million times less likely than winning the lottery. That's somewhat reassuring, but it's still problematic that a developed nation managed to completely lose control over an eight-ton space station. In any case, the ESA and other space agencies will be keeping a close eye on the space station and will hopefully be able to forecast its fall from the sky with greater accuracy as the day draws near.","published_at":1520350940,"content_id":"bdc730d8-be77-3a1b-a59a-d350a35d2acd","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/china-tiangong-1-space-station-could-come-crashing-153423387.html","content_published_at":1520350463,"content_time":1520350463,"content_relative_time":175,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":175,"comment_relative_time":175,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f8d36816-45e5-3747-8170-3a1efd6e5614","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-be37bb59-a5f9-396a-9035-3a945f9f4c7c_a-f8d36816-45e5-3747-8170-3a1efd6e5614","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-be37bb59-a5f9-396a-9035-3a945f9f4c7c_a-f8d36816-45e5-3747-8170-3a1efd6e5614","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/quiz-well-know-mission-space-4mal9s4","author":"nanook","provider":"Disney Parks Blog","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/disneyparks.disney.go.com\/blog\/2018\/03\/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-mission-space-2\/?CMP=SOC-DPFY18Q1wo0301180307180022C","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LOrLpf8in_5nTC7tMe3JSw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/v5S.bpnEQDFnvKINSPvpcQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f8d36816-45e5-3747-8170-3a1efd6e5614-1698273858.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fHg2znFPTHDF9qSTZDtDCA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/v5S.bpnEQDFnvKINSPvpcQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f8d36816-45e5-3747-8170-3a1efd6e5614-1698273858.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/v5S.bpnEQDFnvKINSPvpcQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f8d36816-45e5-3747-8170-3a1efd6e5614-1698273858.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Quiz: How Well Do You Know Mission: SPACE?","summary":"Experiencing the thrill of Mission: SPACE at Epcot is a must-do for many guests visiting the park.

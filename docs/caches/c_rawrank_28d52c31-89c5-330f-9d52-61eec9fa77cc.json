At a briefing during the 34th Space Symposium here April 18, company officials said development of the cargo version of Dream Chaser is on schedule for a first launch in the fourth quarter of 2020. That mission, the first of at least six missions to the International Space Station under a NASA Commercial Resupply Services 2 contract awarded in January 2016, will launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5. \u201cIt is a very well proven rocket.

Theorists are constantly exploring other options; individual galaxies and their satellites arguably favor some modification of gravity to dark matter; there are big controversies over just how fast the Universe is expanding, and the conclusions we've drawn from supernova data may need to be altered. Given that we've made mistaken assumptions in the past by presuming that the unseen Universe contained substances that simply weren't there, from the aether to phlogiston, isn't it a greater leap-of-faith to assume that 95% of the Universe is some invisible, unseen form of energy than it is to assume there's just a flaw in the law of gravity? The answer is a resounding, absolute no, according to almost all astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists who study the Universe.","published_at":1524063939,"content_id":"d008d400-ca2b-3e49-b5e6-40d76a9cdc92","content_url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/starts-with-a-bang\/what-astronomers-wish-everyone-knew-about-dark-matter-and-dark-energy-d13eada60ea0","content_published_at":1523973661,"content_time":1523973661,"content_relative_time":59,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":59,"comment_relative_time":59,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

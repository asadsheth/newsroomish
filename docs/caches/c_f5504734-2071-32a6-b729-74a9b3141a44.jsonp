GasBuddy, which provides real-time fuel price information at the retail level, reports a national average retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at $2.98, up nearly 20 cents from one month ago and 60 cents higher than this time last year. A spike in crude oil prices, triggered in part by U.S. sanctions pressures on Iran and a downturn in production from Venezuela, one of the top oil exporters to the United States, has led to steep price hikes at the pump.

The ITC on Jan. 26 voted 4-0 to block the Trump administration from placing a 292% tariff on Bombardier CSeries jets sold in the U.S. The decision reverses a Commerce Department ruling last year that found Bombardier had received unfair government subsidies, which allowed it to sell the planes at artificially low prices. Caught in the middle was Delta Air Lines, which agreed to buy 75 CSeries planes and had called the tariff \"absurd.\" Boeing could still appeal the ruling to the International Court of Trade in New York or ask the U.S. government to argue its case in front of the World Trade Organization, but success on appeal seems unlikely.","published_at":1517532592,"content_id":"ba48ffcc-71e0-302d-ba2d-25b8a56b1d60","content_url":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2018\/02\/01\/boeing-could-win-despite-losing-in-bombardier-tari.aspx","content_published_at":1517491260,"content_time":1517491260,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":29,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8c24c11c-a8db-3f90-9cae-a2b675c8be1f","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-3d3b2e67-2257-3b75-b6a4-c1d3927df250_a-8c24c11c-a8db-3f90-9cae-a2b675c8be1f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-3d3b2e67-2257-3b75-b6a4-c1d3927df250_a-8c24c11c-a8db-3f90-9cae-a2b675c8be1f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/mexico-presidential-favorite-repeats-call-review-oil-tender-015706348--finance-2ouzcea","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mexico-presidential-favorite-repeats-call-review-oil-tender-015706348--finance.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Mexico presidential favorite repeats call to review oil tender results","summary":"The leading candidate for Mexico's presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, reiterated on Thursday his pledge to review oil contracts if elected, a day after the most successful auction since a landmark energy opening was finalized in 2014.

rules out peace talks with Taliban, undercuts U.S. strategy","summary":"Following a wave of recent attacks claimed by the Taliban in Afghanistan, President Donald Trump made it clear that he was not open to any negotiations with the\u00a0fundamentalist group, despite potential U.S. efforts to engage in future talks. \"We'll also discuss what more we can do to defeat the Taliban,\" Trump said on Monday at an organized luncheon with members of the United Nations Security Council. \"I don't see any talking taking place. I don't think we're prepared to talk right now. It's a whole different fight over there. They're killing people left and right. Innocent people are being killed left and right.\" He continued, \"Killing all over Afghanistan. So we don't want to talk with the Taliban.","published_at":1517429415,"content_id":"6c5454b9-3c02-339a-8426-2d4f878e36d5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.salon.com\/2018\/01\/30\/trump-rules-out-peace-talks-with-taliban-undercuts-u-s-strategy\/","content_published_at":1517352528,"content_time":1517352528,"content_relative_time":68,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":68,"comment_relative_time":68,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts says she has no intention of running for president in 2020, but she also is leaving herself room to reconsider. Warren is refusing to pledge to complete a second six-year Senate term if she's re-elected in November. The high-profile liberal is often discussed as a potential 2020 rival to President Donald Trump. Warren tells NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that she knows there's anxiety among Democrats about a possible second Trump term. A Massachusetts newspaper has challenged Warren to clear up questions about her claims to Native American heritage by taking a DNA test.

can't win a trade war with United States","summary":"March 8 (UPI) -- Bill Morneau is perhaps an influential figure in Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Cabinet, but he's not conducting himself like most finance ministers. Given the budget he presented recently, he may be more of a social justice warrior. Supporting more diversity, equality and inclusiveness is obviously critical to the betterment of our society, but I believe most Canadians expect more from a finance minister. His recent budget was sorely lacking. There were no plans to balance the books and, most importantly, there were no mitigating strategies presented in relation to a floundering global trade environment.

The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) will reduce tariffs in countries that together amount to more than 13 percent of the global economy \u2014 a total of $10 trillion. With the United States, it would have represented 40 percent.","published_at":1520503877,"content_id":"74262732-cfd9-3b8c-9590-771ca653e32e","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/03\/08\/eleven-countries-to-sign-landmark-trans-pacific-trade-pact-without-us\/","content_published_at":1520515567,"content_time":1520515567,"content_relative_time":129,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":129,"comment_relative_time":129,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"bb12c1c6-f784-3b7f-aa18-4c00ad056173","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-7a226077-94ac-3eb2-a7d1-cf1a8f16c97b_a-bb12c1c6-f784-3b7f-aa18-4c00ad056173","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-7a226077-94ac-3eb2-a7d1-cf1a8f16c97b_a-bb12c1c6-f784-3b7f-aa18-4c00ad056173","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/energy-summit-climate-pits-u-against-europe-084121697--finance-1g2jz4d","author":"third_watch","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/energy-summit-climate-pits-u-against-europe-084121697--finance.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"At energy summit, climate pits U.S. against Europe","summary":"Speaking at the CERAWeek conference by IHS Markit in Houston, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden outlined an ambitious plan to reduce the Anglo-Dutch company's carbon footprint and expand in renewables, and called on others to follow. \"The energy landscape is changing fast.","published_at":1520498513,"content_id":"bb12c1c6-f784-3b7f-aa18-4c00ad056173","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/energy-summit-climate-pits-u-against-europe-084121697--finance.html","content_published_at":1520514997,"content_time":1520514997,"content_relative_time":129,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":129,"comment_relative_time":129,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

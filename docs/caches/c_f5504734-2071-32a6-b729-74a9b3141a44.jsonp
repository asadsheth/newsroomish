The ability of firms such as Facebook to easily transfer Europeans' data to the United States was plunged into legal limbo on Thursday when the Irish High Court asked the EU's top court for a detailed assessment of whether the methods were legal. The Irish High Court referral, published on Thursday and due to be submitted to the ECJ by the end of April, stems from a case brought by an Austrian privacy activist against the methods used by Facebook to store user data on U.S. servers following revelations in 2013 of mass U.S. surveillance practices. Cross-border data transfers are an integral part of companies' business - be it for human resources purposes, completing credit card transactions or storing people's browsing histories - but the referral casts renewed uncertainty on the legal mechanisms underpinning billions of dollars' worth of data transfers.","published_at":1523514674,"content_id":"c906af3a-8e32-3f51-9a14-e218239c342c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/eus-top-court-asked-probe-facebook-u-data-101643141--finance.html","content_published_at":1523535062,"content_time":1523535062,"content_relative_time":8,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":8,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6037a2a2-844d-3e2d-96d8-26b329affd67","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-d55b1703-9946-390d-b32a-0759dacf0d6c_a-6037a2a2-844d-3e2d-96d8-26b329affd67","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-d55b1703-9946-390d-b32a-0759dacf0d6c_a-6037a2a2-844d-3e2d-96d8-26b329affd67","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-d55b1703-9946-390d-b32a-0759dacf0d6c_a-6037a2a2-844d-3e2d-96d8-26b329affd67","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ABC News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/wireStory\/china-denies-xi-comments-aimed-settling-us-dispute-54409859?yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"China denies Xi comments aimed at settling US dispute","summary":"China denies President Xi Jinping's promises to cut import tariffs on cars and open China's markets wider meant to be an overture to settle a tariff dispute with Washington","published_at":1523500571,"content_id":"6037a2a2-844d-3e2d-96d8-26b329affd67","content_url":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/wireStory\/china-denies-xi-comments-aimed-settling-us-dispute-54409859?yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1523533255,"content_time":1523533255,"content_relative_time":9,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":9,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"db5a4e81-91ed-3740-8a32-0566ea8ab1af","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-f39a1a21-6bd4-3e18-96f8-8d989237317a_a-db5a4e81-91ed-3740-8a32-0566ea8ab1af","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-f39a1a21-6bd4-3e18-96f8-8d989237317a_a-db5a4e81-91ed-3740-8a32-0566ea8ab1af","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-f39a1a21-6bd4-3e18-96f8-8d989237317a_a-db5a4e81-91ed-3740-8a32-0566ea8ab1af","author":"nanook","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/china-says-u-syria-apos-220037020.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/s5jWo3_HEitlr64nRP6TzA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/f7e8933d169d7d3e07af788b7e5ba1f1","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tcjmYhDVR1jrDPalXqBXyA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MDM7dz0xMjgwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/f7e8933d169d7d3e07af788b7e5ba1f1","height":703,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/f7e8933d169d7d3e07af788b7e5ba1f1","imgw":1280,"imgh":703,"title":"China Says U.S. Should Give Syria's Assad 'an Opportunity to Explain' Before Trump Attacks","summary":"China has urged the U.S. not to take military action against the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who some Western governments and their allies have accused of a chemical weapons attack that Beijing said remains inconclusive.

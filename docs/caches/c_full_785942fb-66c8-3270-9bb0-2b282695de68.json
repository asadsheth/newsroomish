How did Matilda react? By mysteriously blacking out and bashing her beloved cello against a cupboard.\u00a0 In the fourth episode then, she looks for connections between her mental health and Carys\u2019s disappearance. And some clues emerge: Matilda meets dishevelled local Laura (Anastasia Hille), who claims to hear voices informing her of Carys\u2019s fate, and back at the mansion, she comes across some old tomes detailing rituals to unlock the past. Even with its heavily scored bumps and shudders, Requiem can\u2019t quite sustain its early Hammer Horror appeal. The strong performances and some genuinely chilling moments keep things compelling however, not least in the spine-tingling climax of this episode. Toby Dantzic Flint Town Netflix, from today Back in 2014, a cost-cutting exercise left thousands of homes in Flint, Michigan, with contaminated drinking water for years. This new eight-part documentary looks at the fallout from the crisis through the eyes of Flint\u2019s beleaguered police force, who face an uphill struggle \u2013 the community needs their support but are also deeply mistrustful of those in authority, plus dwindling resources makes the officers\u2019 jobs harder still.\u00a0 MasterChef BBC One, 7.30pm Having survived the cooking contest\u2019s opening week, the six heat winners face food critic William Sitwell in this first quarter-final. He challenges them to conjure up a standout pudding showcasing either alcohol or spices. Love Your Garden ITV, 8.00pm; not STV\/UTV\/Wales This week, Alan Titchmarsh and his team are in Bidewell, Devon, helping Tamsyn and Alex Wood who returned to the UK from France after Alex suffered a brain injury. The aim is to turn the Woods\u2019 garden into a coastal sanctuary inspired by Alex\u2019s passion for surfing.\u00a0 The Yorkshire Steam Railway: All Aboard Channel 5, 8.00pm As amiable as its title suggests, this new documentary series follows the lives of those who work on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, one of the country\u2019s most popular steam railways. In this series\u2019 opener, the new season begins with the arrival of star engine Royal Scot, on loan from London.\u00a0 Tones, Drones and Arpeggios: The Magic of Minimalism BBC Four, 9.00pm Conductor Charles Hazlewood explores minimalism, which he argues is the most important musical form of the 20th century. In the fascinating opener of this two-part series, he unpicks the construction of these sometimes confounding sounds and tracks down the genre\u2019s avant-garde pioneers, who brought their mesmeric, spirituality-inspired compositions from California to New York in the Sixties. TD Jo Brand: Secrets of Her Success Channel 5, 10.30pm Channel 5\u2019s celebration of funny women continues with this absorbing profile of the pioneering doyenne of deadpan, Jo Brand. This charts her career from its rocky start on the male-dominated stand-up circuit to her much-admired hospital sitcom Getting On. TD Gladiator (2000)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Film4, 9.00pm This take on the traditional swords-and-sandals epic proved that Russell Crowe deserved to be recognised as a mainstream star, and reaffirmed Ridley Scott\u2019s reputation as a first-rate director. Crowe is Maximus, a former Roman general who rebuilds his career as a gladiator. His bid for vengeance against a vile emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) is compelling. Plus there\u2019s a last hurrah from Oliver Reed. Blades of Glory (2007)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC One, 11.05pm; Wales, 11.35pm;N Ireland, 12.05am You might think that the sequinned world of figure skating is beyond parody, but here Will Ferrell and Jon Heder serve up a zestfully preposterous comedy. Both play rival Olympic ice skaters, Ferrell a loose-living maverick, Heder a prissy perfectionist, who are slung out of the sport but use a loophole to return as an erotic all-male pairing. Amy Poehler co-stars. A Hijacking (2012)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC Two, 11.55pm Tobias Lindholm\u2019s vigorously intelligent hostage thriller, set on board a besieged ship in the Indian Ocean, deftly moves his story between the boat and the shipping company\u2019s offices, where S\u00f8ren Malling\u2019s frazzled CEO attempts to thrash out a bargain. On the other end of the line is the Somalis\u2019 translator. Flies buzz, sweat trickles, negotiations continue, and you feel your breath dry up. Saturday 3 March Pamela Anderson and Piers Morgan Credit: ITV Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories ITV, 9.50pm Piers Morgan puts questions to Pamela Anderson, the model famous for wearing a red swimsuit on Baywatch and for appearing on the cover of Playboy more times than anyone else. To her credit, Anderson is also a fervent animal rights campaigner who convinced Vladimir Putin to ban imports of seal products into Russia. Morgan does ask her about Putin, but his focus is firmly on a sex tape that was made public and whether Anderson has slept with her friend Julian Assange. Despite Morgan\u2019s jovial approach, he doesn\u2019t give her an easy ride, which means that the show\u2019s tone zigzags between a soft chat and an awkward interview. Anderson makes self-deprecating quips about her multiple marriages, although there\u2019s an interesting revelation about a run-in with Harvey Weinstein when she refused to work with a dog in one of his films. It\u2019s left largely to Anderson\u2019s friends \u2013 among them Vivienne Westwood \u2013 appearing in pre-recorded videos to try to provide insight into her psyche. Anderson is an interesting figure, but despite Morgan\u2019s best efforts, the only bombshell, for want of a better word, in this programme is the one sat opposite him. VP Ant & Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway ITV, 7.00pm Ant and Dec\u2019s madcap variety show celebrates its 100th episode tonight. Despite having entered their forties and being dogged by some personal troubles, the Geordie duo\u2019s playful charisma remains undimmed. This episode sees Cuba Gooding Jr and Alfie Boe among the guest stars. VP All Together Now BBC One, 7.15pm The BBC\u2019s latest sing-a-thon reaches its climax, with the 10 finalists competing for a \u00a350,000 prize. Although Rob Beckett\u2019s quips have provided some levity, the format hasn\u2019t captured the imagination. So, the BBC\u2019s search for an adequate replacement for The Voice continues. VP Britain at Low Tide Channel 4, 8.00pm Tori Herridge presents more tales from the riverbank when she investigates the Clyde\u2019s Iron Age heritage. Part travelogue, part history lesson, this episode is a compelling jaunt through Glasgow\u2019s maritime past. VP Troy: Fall of a City BBC One, 9.10pm BBC One\u2019s ambitious sex-and-sandals epic continues, with Hector and Paris (Tom Weston-Jones and Louis Hunter) undertaking a risky mission to Cilicia to\u00a0ask for help in breaking the Greeks\u2019 blockade of Troy. Meanwhile, in Troy, the cause of all the trouble, Helen (Bella Dayne), makes a selfless gesture to win the people\u2019s favour. VP Modus BBC Four, 9.00pm\u00a0and 9.45pm The second run of this Swedish murder-mystery series has veered from its Scandi-noir roots to spin an implausible espionage tale. Still, it\u2019s had some enjoyably twisty moments, along with Greg Wise in full panto-villain mode as odious FBI agent Warren Schifford. This double-bill brings the series to an end, with detective Ingvar Nyman (Henrik Norl\u00e9n) forced to team up with Schifford to find the US President (Kim Cattrall). VP Mosaic Sky Atlantic, 10.00pm The pace picks up in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s small-town crime thriller as a breakthrough in the Olivia Buckland (Sharon Stone) murder causes chief detective Nate Henry (Devin Ratray) to panic. Four years after Eric\u2019s incarceration for the murder, his sister Petra (Jennifer Ferrin) hounds Henry into taking a fresh look at the case. The introduction of Beau Bridges as an ex-police chief brings even more lustre to this stylish whodunit. VP 10 Cloverfield Lane\u00a0(2016) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Channel 4, 9.00pm Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes in a room with her leg chained to a pipe. Her host is Howard (John Goodman), a quick-tempered survivalist type with a stockpile of food and an appetite for armageddon. Is this a thriller, a puzzle, or a monster movie? Producer JJ Abrams\u2019s vice-like spiritual successor to Cloverfield keeps you guessing until the end.\u00a0 The Help (2011)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC Two, 11.20pm;\u00a0not Wales Emma Stone sparkles among the fine female cast in this enjoyable adaptation of Kathryn Stockett\u2019s 2009 novel. She stars as a budding journalist working in Sixties Jackson, Mississippi, who convinces two black maids (Viola Davis and the Oscar-winning Octavia Spencer) to work secretly with her on a book and reveal the hardships inflicted on them. Bryce Dallas Howard is a delightfully hissable villain. My Brother\u00a0the Devil (2012)\u00a0 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC One, 11.55pm; Scotland, 12.40am A gritty coming-of-age story about two Muslim brothers. Swaggering gang member Rash (James Floyd) is king of his particular hill in Hackney, and mentor and protector of his younger brother Mo (Fady Elsayed). Rash wants to use his drug money to put Mo through college, but an encounter with a photographer named Sayyid opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Sunday 4 March Lady\u00a0Doris Castlerosse Credit: Channel 4 Churchill\u2019s Secret Affair Channel 4, 8.00pm \u201cIn future, no historian will be able to ignore the tale of Winston and Doris\u201d is too great a claim to make at the close of this documentary. But the question of whether or not Britain\u2019s wartime hero Winston Churchill had an affair with Lady Doris Castlerosse in the south of France during the summer of 1934 certainly makes for an engrossing hour. Admittedly, the hard evidence on offer is non-existent. Most of the story is founded on a remark made by Churchill\u2019s former private secretary, Sir John \u201cJock\u201d Colville, in a taped interview in 1985, which was recently unearthed again. Still, historians Warren Dockter and Richard Toye put together a pretty compelling circumstantial case for Churchill engaging in a dalliance at the very least with Lady Castlerosse, a fabulously glamorous social-climbing member of the pre-war \u201cRiviera set\u201d. And the story is backed up by at least one member of her family, niece Caroline Delevingne (who also happens to be the aunt of supermodel Cara Delevingne). Some of the most intriguing speculation focuses on three portraits Churchill painted of Doris, and why he might have desperately wanted them back. GO Hold the Sunset BBC One, 7.30pm Three episodes in and, for a comedy, Hold the Sunset still rather light on laughs despite the powerhouse cast. Tonight, when Edith (Alison Steadman) and Phil (John Cleese) seize the chance to get away for the weekend, Queenie (Anne Reid) spies an opportunity for a party. GO Call the Midwife BBC One, 8.00pm As Barbara (Charlotte Ritchie) is moved into Poplar Hospital\u2019s isolation wing, Dr Turner (Stephen McGann) and Shelagh (Laura Main) get a little too close to a young offender who has discovered that his wife is pregnant. GO Top Gear BBC Two, 8.00pm Matt LeBlanc and Chris Harris head to California to try out some muscle-bound off-roaders. Meanwhile, the new McLaren 720S proves a heart-stopper on the track, and comedian Lee Mack reveals his petrol-head credentials. Also, there\u2019s Top Gear: Extra Gear at 10.50pm. GO Strike: Career of Evil BBC One, 9.00pm By the close last week, Strike (Tom Burke) was barely any closer to finding out who sent Robin (Holliday Grainger), his partner in crime detection, an amputated leg. But someone was doing a fine job of setting him up for the murder of its former owner. Tonight, Robin gets into hot water when another body part turns up in\u00a0her kitchen. GO Bob Monkhouse: Million Joke Man Yesterday, 7.00pm Paul O\u2019Grady hosts this glowing tribute to Bob Monkhouse, a \u201ctowering talent\u201d who was a \u201cwriter, cartoonist, actor, radio and TV presenter, comedian and the most prolific gameshow host ever\u201d. O\u2019Grady also gets access to Monkhouse\u2019s legendary hand-written joke books, in which he meticulously recorded every gag he crafted. GO Oscars 2018 Sky Cinema Oscars, from 11.00pm With lots of home interest (Darkest Hour, Dunkirk, Gary Oldman, Sally Hawkins, Lesley Manville among them), there will be plenty staying up all night to follow the results live. Sky\u2019s dedicated channel has it all, including an entertaining potted history The Oscars: Greatest Shocks, Frocks and Fairytales (11.00pm), followed by all the glamorous arrivals action on Red Carpet Live (midnight) and, finally, the ceremony itself, The 90th Annual Academy Awards (1.30am), once again hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. GO Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 E4, 6.30pm Sickly Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) volunteers for a project during the Second World War in which he is transformed into America\u2019s hulking secret weapon, a \u201csuper-soldier\u201d. Joe Johnston\u2019s film is based on the Forties Marvel comics and, although it doesn\u2019t exactly enthral, the action scenes are terrific fun. The similarly enjoyable sequel, The Winter Soldier, is on Friday, BBC One at 11.05pm. Baby Driver (2017)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Sky Cinema Premiere, 8.00pm Edgar Wright\u2019s infectious car-chase thriller, about a getaway-driving cutie-pie savant (Ansel Elgort, bringing a physical musicality to every on-screen task) whose every move behind the wheel is in Olympic-level sync with whichever song is pulsing in his iPod earbuds, will make you believe in magic. The editing is stunning and keeps the film a hop and skip apart from its forebears. Chocolat (2000) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 ITV3, 10.00pm Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m\u2019s warm adaptation of Joanne Harris\u2019s 1999 novel stars Juliette Binoche as the free spirit who sets up a decadent chocolate shop in a stuffy French village. Just as her confections are melting local hearts, her relationship with a gypsy living at a nearby camp threatens their tolerance. With Johnny Depp playing the rogue, though, who can blame her. Alfred Molina and Judi Dench co-star. Monday 5 March Philip Pullman\u00a0 Credit: BBC Imagine: Philip Pullman: Angels and Daemons BBC One, 10.45pm; Northern Ireland, 11.40pm \u201cI felt that I\u2019d been preparing for something, that I\u2019d been serving a long apprenticeship,\u201d says children\u2019s author Philip Pullman of his most famous works, the His Dark Materials trilogy, a statement which helps explain why these particular books have enthralled readers since the publication of Northern Lights, the first in the series, in 1995.\u00a0 The dry, delightful Pullman makes for the best possible subject for Imagine\u2026 He\u2019s informed, opinionated, both realistic and romantic, and endlessly curious about the world. Here we hear about his early years in Wales with his clergyman grandfather who gave him \u201cthe sense that the world was full of stories\u201d. We also hear about Pullman\u2019s time as a teacher, which was when he honed his craft by teaching his pupils Greek mythology. His atheism is touched on \u2013 \u201chuman beings themselves are quite sufficient to explain both good and evil\u201d \u2013 although sensibly not allowed to overwhelm the film. Instead, Pullman discusses the influence of John Milton on his writing before coming down on the side of another great visionary: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the writer I am without William Blake,\u201d he says with a smile.\u00a0This is an altogether magical documentary. SH Classic Mary Berry BBC One, 8.30pm The unflappable Mary Berry heads to London to visit a school with a secret garden. There, the pupils grow vegetables and look after chickens. She also supervises a keen pair of Year 5 pupils as they prepare school lunch. SH Collateral BBC Two, 9.00pm David Hare\u2019s compelling yet infuriating drama reaches its conclusion as DI Kip Glaspie (Carey Mulligan) pulls it all together, even as army captain Sandrine (Jeany Spark) faces her demons. Meanwhile, John Simm\u2019s MP has a clunky confrontation with his party leader and a rather better one with his ex-wife (Billie Piper). SH Marcella ITV, 9.00pm Things get even murkier this week as Jason (Nicholas Pinnock) gives ex-wife Marcella (Anna Friel) some unwanted news, which causes her to struggle both at work and at home. Thank goodness then for DC LeAnn Hunter (Sophia Brown), who injects some welcome common sense into proceedings. SH Electric Dreams: Autofac Channel 4, 10.00pm This week\u2019s instalment of the sci-fi anthology follows Juno Temple\u2019s idealistic computer hacker working in a collapsing AI-dominated world. When she comes into conflict with a PR robot named Alice (an excellent Janelle Mon\u00e1e), there\u2019s revolution in the air. SH This Country BBC Three\/BBC iPlayer, from 10.00am The countryside comedy goes from strength to strength with an entertaining second episode that sees Kurtan (Charlie Cooper) indoctrinated into the secret ways of labouring by Kerry\u2019s (Daisy May Cooper) dad. The first episode is on BBC One tomorrow at 10.45pm. SH Active Shooter: America Under Fire Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm This series on mass shootings in the US comes to an end with an episode about the 1999 massacre at Columbine school in Colorado, which, following the shooting in Florida last month, no longer stands as the worst high-school shooting in US history. The matter is sensitively handled, as journalist Dave Cullen debunks the theory that the perpetrators were \u201cdepressed outcasts\u201d. But, most importantly, the focus is on the victims and survivors, such as the school\u2019s principal and Jefferson County\u2019s head investigator, who discuss how their lives have changed. SH Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Film4, 11.00am George Roy Hill directed two of the most popular films ever: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sting (1973). But this indifferent Julie Andrews musical of the flapper era came first. There\u2019s much to enjoy in the story of a naive woman who leaves her rural roots behind to seek fortune and romance in Twenties New York. James Fox, as a spiffing salesman,\u00a0is a particular highlight. Carol (2015) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Film4, 9.00pm Todd Haynes\u2019s adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s 1952 novel is gorgeous, gently groundbreaking, and quite possibly be the saddest thing that you\u2019ll ever see. It tells the story of a photographer (Rooney Mara) who has a relationship with an older woman (Cate Blanchett, with a subtlety that\u2019s little short of phenomenal) in New York. Haynes\u2019s film concludes that love is the riskiest but most necessary gamble in anyone\u2019s experience. Nacho Libre (2006) \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 ITV4, 12.05am There are some terrific sight gags in this silly comedy but one might have expected more from Jack Black (who was so good in School of Rock, Shallow Hal and High Fidelity) and the director of Napoleon Dynamite, Jared Hess. Black plays Ignacio, a friar in a Mexican orphanage who, to raise money, moonlights as a Mexican wrestler.

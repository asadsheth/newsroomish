In a tweet on Friday morning Trump said he was displeased about immigration issues in the bill, even though the White House had given assurances on Thursday that he would sign it. At the White House on Friday, many aides were caught by surprise by the veto threat and had no immediate explanation for what prompted it.","published_at":1521811238,"content_id":"9bc4617a-8056-33a3-b920-4cd288a7c44c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/senate-moves-toward-passage-1-3-trillion-government-043150494--business.html","content_published_at":1521821794,"content_time":1521821794,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

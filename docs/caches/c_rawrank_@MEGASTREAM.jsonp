going missing for six years, our son will be with us this Christmas","summary":"Christmas Charity Appeal banner 2017 Only once in the six years that Matthew was missing did I fear the worst. A friend texted saying she was thinking of me, \u2018after what the police have found\u2019. I turned on the news:\u00a0a body had been discovered near where we live in Kent. My heart nearly stopped when they estimated he\u2019d been dead four years, exactly as long as Matthew had been gone. I called a reporter who, thankfully, confirmed it wasn\u2019t him. Somehow I knew he was alive, and that my husband Jim and I would find him.\u00a0 Matt was a lovely child. He was into football, a popular lad. But at 24, out of the blue, he had a psychotic episode and ended up being sectioned.\u00a0 After a stay in hospital, he seemed better. He went back to work as a roofer. Then one Friday in 2010 he went to see a friend in London. I remember saying, \u2018Have a good weekend, don\u2019t forget work on Monday. Love you.\u2019 And that was that. When he didn\u2019t come home on Sunday we were concerned but assumed he\u2019d had one too many beers. We left him a message and on Monday I went to my job at the prison service and Jim to his as a firefighter.\u00a0By Wednesday I said to Jim, \u2018I know it sounds silly but I\u2019m going to report him missing.\u2019\u00a0 The relief at finding him alive was indescribable. But it was the start of a new journey\u2026 The police searched his bedroom and found his phone \u2013 the one we\u2019d been messaging. His driving licence, passport and birth certificate were missing, plus \u00a31,700 in cash that we thought was to fix his car. \u00a0 \u00a0 His friends hadn\u2019t seen him, and one created a Facebook group seeking information; within hours it had 900 members. We\u2019d look at it night and day and follow up every lead. We\u2019d go anywhere he\u2019d been spotted. The search dominated our lives.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d have done without the Missing People charity. They supported us and helped keep Matt in the public eye, putting photos of him on billboards and in The Big Issue.\u00a0 Telegraph Christmas Appeal 2017 | What are the charities? Days turned into years. But we never lost hope. Each Christmas, I put presents for him under\u00a0the tree. And we left his room exactly as it was when he left.\u00a0 Then, in May of last year, the police told us Matt might have been found. He\u2019d been picked up by police in Spain, after behaving oddly. After an agonising two-week wait while police confirmed it was him, we learnt he was in a secure unit in a Madrid hospital. The flight was one of the worst journeys of our lives: the anticipation was unbearable.\u00a0 Our reunion wasn\u2019t the joyful one we\u2019d imagined: he didn\u2019t want to see us.\u00a0When he eventually agreed, we were shocked \u2013 he was emaciated with long hair and a beard. After 10 minutes, he wanted us to leave.\u00a0 Matt in 2010, before he went missing The relief at finding him alive was indescribable. But it was the start of a new journey, which is in some ways harder. It took us three weeks to get him back to the UK. At another secure unit he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and stabilised with medication.\u00a0A year ago he moved to respite care. We see him weekly and there\u2019s such an improvement in his appearance and well-being. I know he\u2019s progressed, as I get a cuddle from him now when\u00a0I see him. The first time that happened, I was a blubbering wreck. He\u2019ll never be 100 per cent and I have to accept the man he\u2019s become, but we count our blessings. He\u2019s alive and well and I know exactly where he is. Matthew won\u2019t be with us on Christmas Day \u2013 he prefers Boxing Day, as there are fewer people, but we\u2019ll be making the most of it. Given that the Christmas before last we didn\u2019t know if he was alive or dead, this is 100 per cent better.

asked her about accusations in a 2005 lawsuit that she sexually harassed and retaliated against a male subordinate who said he had rejected her advances. Multiple sources with knowledge of the case told The Star that the man reached a settlement with LabOne, the company where Ramsey was executive vice president of human resources. Court documents show that the man, Gary Funkhouser, and LabOne agreed to dismiss the case permanently after mediation in 2006. Ramsey, a 56-year-old retired business executive from Leawood, was one of the Democratic candidates vying to challenge Republican Rep.

The spending package, expected to be publicly unveiled on Wednesday, includes $380 million to provide states with grants that would help them purchase more secure voting machines and improve election cyber security training. If adopted, the funding will represent the first concrete steps from Congress to bolster election security following a 2016 presidential campaign marred by allegations of Russian meddling. The spending bill also includes a $307 million increase over the Trump administration's request for the FBI's budget for counter-intelligence efforts to fight Russian cyber attacks this year, according to a summary of the bill seen by Reuters.","published_at":1521795492,"content_id":"6143a678-8072-37fe-9f93-e7ca40d65e14","content_url":"http:\/\/uk.businessinsider.com\/r-us-spending-bill-to-provide-380-million-for-election-cyber-security-sources-2018-3?yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1521608400,"content_time":1521608400,"content_relative_time":182,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"InfoSec","vibe_id":"b7ceb013-9918-317e-ba58-bdb2987cf440","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

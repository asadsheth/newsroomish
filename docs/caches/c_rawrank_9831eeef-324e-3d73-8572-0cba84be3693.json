to review 10-year bans to domestic cricketers","summary":"The BCB will review its decision to punish Fear Fighters Club and Lalmatia Club, their players, coach and manager, after they admitted to losing Dhaka Second Division Cricket League games on purpose as a form of protest against alleged biased umpiring. The need for reassessment came after the punished submitted multiple letters to the BCB requesting a pardon to renew their careers over the last 12 months. In January this year, both Lalmatia and Fear Fighters appealed to play in this year's Second Division League but were denied. Jalal Yunus, the BCB director who was part of the three-member inquiry committee formed in April 2017, said that the BCB would discuss all these appeals later this month.","published_at":1523259866,"content_id":"28723393-f0de-3397-a4ab-984657984abf","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23087928\/bangladesh-cricket-board-review-10-year-bans-domestic-cricketers","content_published_at":1523237517,"content_time":1523237517,"content_relative_time":58,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":58,"comment_relative_time":58,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

The House is voting Thursday on a bill that would continue the program for five years but change its structure to a managed care model. The plan also would impose new work requirements on enrollees and use 5 percent of liquor revenues to cover the state's cost as federal funding decreases. The bill has already cleared the Senate.

That odd result is reflected in a report issued Tuesday by the Trump administration. After federal aid, the average monthly premium paid by subsidized customers on HealthCare.gov is dropping to $89 from last year's $106. That's a 16 percent savings even though the \"list price\" premium went up about 30 percent, now averaging $639 for those subsidized customers.

Beth O'Connor at the Virginia Rural Health Association says more than 80 rural hospitals across the country have closed since 2010. \u201cTwo thirds of those are in states that have not expanded Medicaid.

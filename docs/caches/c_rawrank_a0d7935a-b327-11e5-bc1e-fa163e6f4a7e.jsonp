The joint Senate-House measure calls for repeal of the mandate, which requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The plan could pass both chambers on Tuesday before going to Trump, who will sign it into law. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) -- and in particular, the individual mandate -- have been widely unpopular with Republicans ever since former President Barack Obama signed the health reform law in 2010.

Jodie Whittaker will play the 13th incarnation of the Time Lord in the new series later this year. She will be the first woman to take on the role. In preparation, viewers can watch all 10 series and special episodes that have aired since the programme's return to the BBC. Controller of programming for the BBC Dan McGolpin said: \"We're reinventing the BBC for a new generation and BBC iPlayer is key to that. \"Bringing back these series of Doctor Who is just part of our offer this summer, giving viewers the chance to uncover or rediscover the Doctor's previous adventures.\" Christopher Eccleston was the first actor to play the show's revived titular character, with his sidekick Rose being portrayed by Billie Piper. Doctor Who: the best episodes ranked Following Eccleston's departure after one series, David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi have all gone on to star as the Doctor. The revamped show has also attracted high-profile stars to make appearances, including Simon Pegg, Sir Derek Jacobi, Kylie Minogue, Andrew Garfield, Felicity Jones and Bill Nighy. Doctor Who has been one of the BBC's biggest successes in recent years. Ratings for every series from 2005 to 2014 averaged between seven and eight million viewers. However, figures were down to 5.5 million for Capaldi's last full series in 2017. Whittaker made her first appearance as the new Doctor in last year's special transformation episode on Christmas Day. Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall will preside as the new series' showrunner, taking on the mantle from Steven Moffat who was in the role for eight years. The new series of Doctor Who will air on the BBC in the autumn.","published_at":1528067408,"content_id":"56fd9f26-bb5b-33d5-be5a-74836fb4b628","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/10-series-doctor-since-2005-230100282.html","content_published_at":1528115877,"content_time":1528115877,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"TV buzz","vibe_id":"785942fb-66c8-3270-9bb0-2b282695de68","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-785942fb-66c8-3270-9bb0-2b282695de68_c-3199933b-bd81-3e1c-a335-22553d9a3b31_a-4c68e487-6e0b-372b-86c2-e59d7d9c366e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/tv-buzz\/100-sneak-peek-kane-makes-jp7p8gc","author":"nanook","provider":"TVLine.com","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.tvline.com","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-01-04\/4a535840-b2bc-11e5-bc8e-a5d2fdd6234c_8ed8a6466a7f44bc0d4dc03cbab5fbb5.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/100-sneak-peek-kane-makes-230057590.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JrXbMRIYX5QOluzjx5t2hQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/tvline.com\/7bcce2f7eb40656c84fd5c0aa5c958d0","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bIKheDG9qQKmyD.xSGj49g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjA7dz02MjA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/tvline.com\/7bcce2f7eb40656c84fd5c0aa5c958d0","height":420,"width":620,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/tvline.com\/7bcce2f7eb40656c84fd5c0aa5c958d0","imgw":620,"imgh":420,"title":"The 100 Sneak Peek: Kane Makes a New Enemy... and a Surprising Ally","summary":"The following clip from Tuesday\u2019s episode of The 100 (The CW, 9\/8c) will have you asking: Whose war is it, anyway?

The ITV soap also saw the villainous Pat Phelan, played by Connor McIntyre, recognised with an award after the character met his grisly exit on Friday night. In total Coronation Street hauled in six prizes at the ceremony at the Hackney Empire in east London, including the coveted best soap award, as its decision to take on harrowing storylines was recognised. Fallon's character, Bethany Platt, was groomed by the Nathan Curtis who forced her and a number of other girls to have sex with his friends during a series of sordid episodes. Meanwhile McIntyre's Phelan has conducted a murderous reign of terror across Weatherfield before being halted by his nemesis Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) in Friday night's episode as she plunged a knife into his chest. McIntyre beat EastEnders Jake Wood who lost in five of the six categories he was nominated for. Another Coronation Street win went to Fallon's on-screen uncle Jack P\u00a0Shepherd, whose character David Platt has been at the centre of a male rape storyline. The British Soap Awards were hosted by Phillip Schofield Credit: ITV He collected the best actor prize while Fallon took home the best actress and best female dramatic performance prizes. Channel 4's Hollyoaks collected four prizes, including best male dramatic performance for Ross Adams category and the best storyline for Lily's self harm. Adams beat strong contenders including Wood, McIntyre, Emmerdale's Jeff Hordley and Doctors' Chris Walker. He told the crowd: \"Oh my word, this is really, really unbelievable. I think Hollyoaks does issue-based storylines really well, and I'm hugely proud of them for telling this story as well as they did.\" He added: \"I love soap, I love all of the soaps. Years ago when I sat working as a PA to the producer of Coronation Street, I never thought I'd be stood here collecting an award and this is just the icing on the cake.\" Wood, who plays Max Branning, had his sole win in the scene of the year category where the prize was split for the first time in British Soap Award history. Taking to the stage, Wood sent a special message to his former co-star, Dame Barbara Windsor. He said: \"Can I send a big EastEnders' hug out to Barbara Windsor and her husband Scott. I speak for everyone here when I say we love you very much.\" Connor McIntyre also won an award Credit: PA Dame Barbara and Scott recently revealed the 80-year-old Carry On star was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in April 2014. EastEnders shared the best scene prize with fellow BBC soap Doctors who had been nominated for their Bollywood proposal scene. Wood was nominated alongside his on-screen daughters Lauren and Abi Branning for the EastEnders Christmas Day episode in which the two youngsters fell from the roof of the Queen Vic pub. Emmerdale - the big winner last year - picked up two awards including the one-off greatest moment in soap history prize for their 2016 scene, the Hotten by-pass crash. Meanwhile EastEnders star Rudolph Walker, 78, who has portrayed Patrick Trueman since 2001, was handed the outstanding achievement award while the BBC soap's Lorraine Stanley, who plays Karen Taylor, won the best newcomer award. Doctors actor Ian Midlane won the best comedy performance prize for his role of Dr Al Haskey. Anti-sexual harassment movements Time's Up and Me Too - staples of award shows in 2018 - were referenced by Hollyoaks actress Lysette Anthony who had Me Too scrawled on her wrist while Doctors actress Elisabeth Dermot Walsh sported a Time's Up badge as she walked the red carpet.

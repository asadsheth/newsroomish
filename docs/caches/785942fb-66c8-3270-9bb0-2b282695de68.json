A show's lead provides a foothold for the audience to become involved in the storyline and grows attached to as the show progresses. If a series is written correctly, its lead character can commit some of the worst sins and still have the support of loyal and involved fans. However,\u00a0sometimes, something interesting happens. A show can be dramatic, investing, and completely amazing, but still have one problem: its main character, of all things. Some of the best shows ever produced have pulled fans in with their incredible storytelling but made them suffer horrible lead characters.

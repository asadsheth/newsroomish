It's really just an extreme version of sex under capitalism we're all familiar with because it's all around us in everything, everywhere and has been for a very long time. What's at the bottom of the incel worldview: sex is a commodity, accumulation of this commodity enhances a man's status, and every man has a right to accumulation, but women are in some mysterious way obstacles to this, and they are therefore the enemy as well as the commodity.","published_at":1526122171,"content_id":"78460bfe-a9ad-3b52-9cf9-0e61e34a29c9","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2018\/may\/12\/sex-capitalism-incel-movement-misogyny-feminism","content_published_at":1526119227,"content_time":1526119227,"content_relative_time":107,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":107,"comment_relative_time":107,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"215c418b-147d-3fcb-ac87-05e7d52c5bd9","post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-2fbc728e-0acf-3509-85b6-2f6d5fdc2528_a-215c418b-147d-3fcb-ac87-05e7d52c5bd9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

As an adolescent, I had little opportunity, and when I married I\u00a0told my wife, but she was unsympathetic. I\u00a0suppressed the urge, and focused on the good points of our relationship, although I admit our sex life was fairly average. When my wife and I split up three years ago, I realised I could explore transvestism. I bought some sexy clothes and joined a transvestite dating website, posting a picture of myself in an alluring short silk dress, a\u00a0blond wig and full makeup. I said I\u00a0was interested in relationships with other TVs, women and men.","published_at":1526029511,"content_id":"a0f5cd5f-ed81-3c10-9dc3-28bb129f05f4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2018\/may\/11\/my-life-sex-solitary-transvestite-kissing-man-dressed-woman-still-man","content_published_at":1526029177,"content_time":1526029177,"content_relative_time":132,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":132,"comment_relative_time":132,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8b5a1dc7-db67-3816-8c85-fdf311d90f13","post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-9a0598ad-cb9c-32b5-89a5-198bebee0a13_a-8b5a1dc7-db67-3816-8c85-fdf311d90f13","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-9a0598ad-cb9c-32b5-89a5-198bebee0a13_a-8b5a1dc7-db67-3816-8c85-fdf311d90f13","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/relationships\/hidden-crisis-thats-fuelling-incel-4pe3bhx","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"macleans.ca","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.macleans.ca\/?p=1123979","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IS3Ktpo3irjAuX2BwXEoYg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rqmqwkGn06jmGJpWcdTtGQ--\/dz04MjI7aD01NDg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8b5a1dc7-db67-3816-8c85-fdf311d90f13--456813185.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QjaXh4eIsQlM9boJPHZQzw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NDg7dz04MjI7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rqmqwkGn06jmGJpWcdTtGQ--\/dz04MjI7aD01NDg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8b5a1dc7-db67-3816-8c85-fdf311d90f13--456813185.jpeg","height":548,"width":822,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rqmqwkGn06jmGJpWcdTtGQ--\/dz04MjI7aD01NDg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8b5a1dc7-db67-3816-8c85-fdf311d90f13--456813185.jpeg","imgw":822,"imgh":548,"title":"The hidden crisis that's fuelling the 'incel rebellion'","summary":"Two weeks ago, a man climbed behind the wheel of a rented van, and used it to commit the worst mass homicide in Toronto's history.

Rather than a substantial conversation about the crisis of angry and disaffected young white men turning to mass violence, two general outlooks have emerged.

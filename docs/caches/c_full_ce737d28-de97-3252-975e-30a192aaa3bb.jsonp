In addition, the medications used to treat many conditions can lead to sexual side effects that can impact your desire to be sexual.\" Hormonal issues can also play a role.

The male sex hormone testosterone can fluctuate over time.

Lawson added that decades of sexual perpetration research has shown that perpetrators will say things or do things to make the victim stay quiet.","published_at":1514693756,"content_id":"955b5469-4d03-3e9c-a5ae-09c3debba79b","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-01-importance-therapy-sexual-assault.html","content_published_at":1515062344,"content_time":1515062344,"content_relative_time":704,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":704,"comment_relative_time":704,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"aeb1b6b3-7157-3e2c-8e34-9906124adc82","post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-2bd5d6d4-87aa-31b4-81d3-93cb18a1b44b_a-aeb1b6b3-7157-3e2c-8e34-9906124adc82","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-2bd5d6d4-87aa-31b4-81d3-93cb18a1b44b_a-aeb1b6b3-7157-3e2c-8e34-9906124adc82","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/relationships\/rape-relationships-very-real-thing-6916r0g","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Hello Giggles","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/rape-relationships-very-real-thing-000636122.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/d7pjilAI4u7yzQ53Qz379w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/hello_giggles_454\/96ad2c589c15fc3b43547fd16a1b5416","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qm6OsB4JNfqzJ4IkgXX4QQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MTc7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/hello_giggles_454\/96ad2c589c15fc3b43547fd16a1b5416","height":717,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/hello_giggles_454\/96ad2c589c15fc3b43547fd16a1b5416","imgw":1024,"imgh":717,"title":"Rape in relationships is a very real thing, and we need to call it what it is","summary":"On Thursday afternoon, Bobette Riales came forward on Twitter and accused actor Danny Masterson of raping her \u201crepeatedly,\u201d while she was in\u2026","published_at":1513901423,"content_id":"aeb1b6b3-7157-3e2c-8e34-9906124adc82","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/rape-relationships-very-real-thing-000636122.html","content_published_at":1513901196,"content_time":1513901196,"content_relative_time":1027,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":1027,"comment_relative_time":1027,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

And then watched others propose something very similar and vow the audience. Or stopped yourself from sharing your ideas for fear of disapproval or judgment, and wished you could be more like those (men) who can speak fearlessly, and even shrug off criticism as though nothing happened? Welcome to the world of most women. It's true that sometimes we don't bother to speak up for what we want or believe in because we've become so used to seeing our ideas taken lightly, or having been spoken over way too many times that we see no point in engaging in dialogue.

Katy Moore revealed that in the depths of her addiction she would stalk men, obsessively message and even jet to other countries 'to get the guy.' Speaking about her life as a sex addict in a piece for Whimn, Ms Moore said everything she did as a sex addict was a desperate attempt to find love. 'I chased uncommitted guys, I got side-tracked by married men and I used sex to lure anyone in, in the hope they would fall desperately in love with me; when all I really wanted was that closeness with someone, anyone.'

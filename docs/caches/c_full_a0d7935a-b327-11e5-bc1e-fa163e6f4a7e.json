Be that as it may, after just a few minutes reviewing my employer's healthcare package I couldn't help but feel I would be better off financially going without coverage in the US, at least in the short-term. Paying $256 a month for a high deductible plan means that during the four months or so we have left until hopefully returning to Canada, we will need to spend more than $3,000 on healthcare before most services either my wife or I could possibly need even begin to receive coverage. For insurance to kick in for both of us the family deductible must be met, pushing that number to somewhere just north of $5,000.","published_at":1521960297,"content_id":"926041d4-59b6-30c9-a7b8-7c71913b9ee0","content_url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@craig.axford\/even-after-obamacare-americas-healthcare-system-still-sucks-f1ca8e0afb14","content_published_at":1521817261,"content_time":1521817261,"content_relative_time":77,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":77,"comment_relative_time":77,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-5c1184bf-1808-3176-b4ec-476854adf3be_a-1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-5c1184bf-1808-3176-b4ec-476854adf3be_a-1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/alternatives-buying-cobra-insurance-62wnn0g","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"TheStreet","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/story\/14526128\/1\/alternatives-to-buying-cobra-insurance.html?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8MdwKaiA0NCQPnZtmXUN3Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Ew25mKk.LU8s5RDb2f2xA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee-892197845.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WXcf5TbAdOeJzkCO4d8rxg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDY3O3c9MTYwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Ew25mKk.LU8s5RDb2f2xA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee-892197845.jpeg","height":1067,"width":1600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Ew25mKk.LU8s5RDb2f2xA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee-892197845.jpeg","imgw":1600,"imgh":1067,"title":"Alternatives to Buying COBRA Insurance","summary":"Employees who are suddenly faced without the prospect of a job often lean toward purchasing COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act).

The White House's Council of Economic Advisers issued a report this week declaring that insurers have made a lot of money since the Affordable Care Act took effect, primarily thanks to large premium increases and generous federal funding of premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion. The release coincided with an unsuccessful attempt in the Senate to restore funding for a second set of Obamacare subsidies -- which helped to reduce low-income enrollees' deductibles and co pays -- that President Donald Trump eliminated last fall. \"Despite an initial rough patch in the ACA marketplaces, the ACA Medicaid coverage expansion and subsidies to insurers have resulted in a large increase in health insurer profits,\" the four-page report said.","published_at":1521805704,"content_id":"554289ce-8d85-3e8f-8682-98f53c0c495c","content_url":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/23\/news\/economy\/trump-obamacare-insurers\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29","content_published_at":1521801591,"content_time":1521801591,"content_relative_time":82,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":82,"comment_relative_time":82,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f63aed1b-1b84-3e7d-8c7e-e3ffe11420ee_a-d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f63aed1b-1b84-3e7d-8c7e-e3ffe11420ee_a-d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/obamacares-medicaid-expansion-helped-fuel-35jd6mf","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Federalist","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2018\/03\/23\/obamacares-medicaid-expansion-helped-fuel-misery-opioid-crisis\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nKI2T1tKW_sPHaTwi.m1gQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/usFL1wJdcR94xab.lOVTXQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzMxO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601--535214748.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6JXmjLk3IOekj.DWBpD9xg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MzE7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/usFL1wJdcR94xab.lOVTXQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzMxO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601--535214748.jpeg","height":731,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/usFL1wJdcR94xab.lOVTXQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzMxO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601--535214748.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":731,"title":"How Obamacare's Medicaid Expansion Helped Fuel The Opioid Crisis","summary":"The opioid crisis continues to ravage the country, destroying lives.

Instead, the poll's respondents more frequently identified government dissatisfaction, immigration and race relations as the nation's most important problem, results show. Guns or gun control was the fourth most common answer, mentioned as the most important problem facing the country in 6 percent of answers. The top issue, government dissatisfaction, was cited 23 percent of the time. Immigration and race relations had rates of 11 and 7 percent, respectively.","published_at":1523977232,"content_id":"187d1dc6-d4ad-3842-9831-69c295265a34","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/US\/2018\/04\/17\/Gallup-Americans-no-longer-say-gun-control-is-nations-top-problem\/2991523973875\/","content_published_at":1523976946,"content_time":1523976946,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Gun control debate","vibe_id":"2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":6,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"70d59cb5-bb65-3f38-b129-73d833de07f2","post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-6592264a-4f4e-3a9d-8608-005baf947adf_a-70d59cb5-bb65-3f38-b129-73d833de07f2","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-6592264a-4f4e-3a9d-8608-005baf947adf_a-70d59cb5-bb65-3f38-b129-73d833de07f2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/gun-control-debate\/even-chicago-plan-push-gun-4joh3ng","author":"third_watch","provider":"Bloomberg","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/?cmpid=yhoo.logo","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/08\/bloomberg-106x27_102102.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-04-16\/even-in-chicago-plan-to-push-gun-control-on-wall-street-stalls?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZFSiZgQ0Xp0oXZJURNz2BA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/70ef70c210b1bb057a7e525dca935db3","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cGU1ZJba.ki_OnU9iqU1uQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03ODU7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/70ef70c210b1bb057a7e525dca935db3","height":785,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/70ef70c210b1bb057a7e525dca935db3","imgw":1200,"imgh":785,"title":"Even in Chicago, Plan to Push Gun Control on Wall Street Stalls","summary":"Few places know the toll of gun violence as well as Chicago.

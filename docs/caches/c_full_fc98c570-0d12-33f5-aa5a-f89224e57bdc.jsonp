However, how these different functions are sustained and regulated at the molecular level has been elusive. In a study published in Science Advances, Chang Lu and his team found significant difference in the molecular machinery that turns on and off gene expression between cerebellum and prefrontal cortex of a mouse brain. Their results provide clues to the molecular apparatus that is involved in conscious thinking in brains. \"Prefrontal cortex, at the frontal part of the brain, is generally considered the center for decision making and planning, while cerebellum, at the back of the skull, is responsible for","published_at":1524363071,"content_id":"905ac2d3-4b63-33a2-b9b3-4aeba4a37ba7","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-04-difference-gene-brain.html","content_published_at":1524074403,"content_time":1524074403,"content_relative_time":119,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":119,"comment_relative_time":119,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"78836fac-4cef-3aca-90c9-68b5bf0734f4","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-af5cd056-9cb8-3980-b61c-d9ce0468714a_a-78836fac-4cef-3aca-90c9-68b5bf0734f4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-af5cd056-9cb8-3980-b61c-d9ce0468714a_a-78836fac-4cef-3aca-90c9-68b5bf0734f4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/three-facts-landing-mars-64923k2","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"BBC","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-43788990","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rGqISplm_no2oWeloQAlcw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XtCgMor3Woh4O15DxwTuZw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_78836fac-4cef-3aca-90c9-68b5bf0734f4--549136834.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_mmb.347AtrcMFpDLKKEeg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XtCgMor3Woh4O15DxwTuZw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_78836fac-4cef-3aca-90c9-68b5bf0734f4--549136834.jpeg","height":576,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XtCgMor3Woh4O15DxwTuZw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_78836fac-4cef-3aca-90c9-68b5bf0734f4--549136834.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":576,"title":"Three facts about landing on Mars","summary":"Caley Burke is a Nasa flight analyst based at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The magnetic ground state of the pseudomorphic Fe-DL is a spin spiral state with a period of about 1.2\u2009nm, which is stable in external magnetic fields of up to 9\u2009T23. On the right side of Fig.\u00a01c, a hexagonal lattice with twice the lattice constant of the substrate is observed, i.e., a p(2\u2009\u00d7\u20092) superstructure with respect to the Ir(111) surface, which we assign to a hydrogen-loaded Fe-DL. Note that the modulation on the several nm scale in Fig.\u00a01c is due to the magnetic structure of the film and will be discussed together with Fig.\u00a02.","published_at":1524352288,"content_id":"8d367a2b-1e7d-3a2d-a5f9-c76a1ec2a879","content_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-018-04015-z","content_published_at":1524200400,"content_time":1524200400,"content_relative_time":84,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":84,"comment_relative_time":84,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

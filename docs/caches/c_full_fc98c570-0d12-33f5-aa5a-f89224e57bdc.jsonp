Solar cells essentially harvest energy from the Sun or other light sources and turn it into electrical energy. In simple terms, light hits the solar cell and knocks electrons out which can then flow as a current. The effect of knocking electrons out of a substance with light is known as the photoelectric effect and was the reason why Einstein thought that light could be described as quanta","published_at":1524140680,"content_id":"2e2717c9-9dad-3469-b2d0-455eff45afff","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/meriameberboucha\/2018\/04\/19\/semiconductor-nanowires-could-revolutionize-solar-technology\/","content_published_at":1524114000,"content_time":1524114000,"content_relative_time":10,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":10,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b85907b3-bce8-3760-9173-135dae746fad","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-cba8ce9a-e9ec-3ade-9616-69936194b74e_a-b85907b3-bce8-3760-9173-135dae746fad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-cba8ce9a-e9ec-3ade-9616-69936194b74e_a-b85907b3-bce8-3760-9173-135dae746fad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/spacex-launches-planet-hunting-tess-1qkyjb0","author":"nanook","provider":"Mashable","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/18\/spacex-launches-nasa-tess-planet-hunter\/?utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"SpaceX launches planet-hunting TESS to space before landing rocket back on Earth","summary":"Have fun in space, TESS!\u00a0 Our favorite new NASA mission \u2014 called TESS, short for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \u2014 \u00a0launched to space at 6:51 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket carrying the satellite landed back on Earth on a drone ship in the Atlantic not long after.\u00a0 TESS is on a mission to hunt for never-before-seen alien planets circling distant stars, particularly those that have the potential for hosting alien life.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Here's how NASA's TESS will hunt for alien planets TESS plans to survey 85 percent of the sky, keeping a particular eye on 200,000 stars once it gets to its expected orbit in the coming weeks.

Irma was as wide as the state and slammed the Lower Keys as a Cat 4 before barreling north and making a second landfall near Marco Island as a Cat 3. But what was baffling was how little of the forest, perfectly evolved to endure hurricanes, had recovered when scientists retraced their flight three months later. \"What took

The researchers analyzed a wide range of clinical, cognitive, and genetic data from more than 6000 children and adolescents. They derived a score of general cognitive ability as well as early signs of psychiatric symptoms for each individual, and analyzed images of pathways in the brain of more than 700 of the participants using advanced machine learning techniques.

Prized for its strength and flexibility, material scientists have long tried to produce synthetic analogs for spider silk. The results of previous efforts, however, have been mixed. Studies have shown the importance of beta sheets, or beta strands, the secondary structure in spider silk proteins, but scientists have struggled to understand how these strength-giving structures form. The transformation from soluble proteins to crystalized silk happens fast, making it difficult to study the proteins' structures.

One person in two over the age of 90 will suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to some degree. As the population ages, AD and its related conditions are becoming a veritable epidemic, with seemingly no cure in sight. Genetic in a small proportion of people (those with early-onset AD), the disease's origin is unknown in 95 per cent of cases; age is the principal risk factor.","published_at":1527610692,"content_id":"a5a3394b-e95e-335c-b40b-0a1cfbe767c4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.news-medical.net\/news\/20180529\/Study-sheds-light-on-the-origin-of-most-common-and-prevalent-form-of-Alzheimers-disease.aspx","content_published_at":1527610200,"content_time":1527610200,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1c89d46b-fab1-3fe5-bbc0-a9548760492b","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-4e4c6f95-5e75-30f4-bc29-52d24fa11763_a-1c89d46b-fab1-3fe5-bbc0-a9548760492b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-4e4c6f95-5e75-30f4-bc29-52d24fa11763_a-1c89d46b-fab1-3fe5-bbc0-a9548760492b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/mystery-earths-missing-nitrogen-solved-2sj90pb","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Scientific American","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/mystery-of-earths-missing-nitrogen-solved\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dMzSmkmRsQvaOCPHqAHspg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SLBNAo9JZ2xcopWSPtsHnw--\/dz01OTc7aD0zMzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1c89d46b-fab1-3fe5-bbc0-a9548760492b-1849495300.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/I4babJ7Yd637N.21n24bWQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMzU7dz01OTc7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SLBNAo9JZ2xcopWSPtsHnw--\/dz01OTc7aD0zMzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1c89d46b-fab1-3fe5-bbc0-a9548760492b-1849495300.jpeg","height":335,"width":597,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SLBNAo9JZ2xcopWSPtsHnw--\/dz01OTc7aD0zMzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1c89d46b-fab1-3fe5-bbc0-a9548760492b-1849495300.jpeg","imgw":597,"imgh":335,"title":"Mystery of Earth's Missing Nitrogen Solved","summary":"Experts used to think nearly all nitrogen in soil came directly from the atmosphere, sequestered by microbes or dissolved in rain. But it turns out scientists have been overlooking another major source of this element, which is crucial to plant growth: up to a quarter of the nitrogen in soil and plants seeps out of bedrock, according to a\u00a0study published in April in Science. Apart from a few scattered studies, \u201cthe [research] community never thought to look at the rocks,\u201d says lead study author Benjamin Z. Houlton, a global ecologist at the University of California, Davis. This discovery has implications beyond understanding the planet's nitrogen cycle; it could also alter climate models.

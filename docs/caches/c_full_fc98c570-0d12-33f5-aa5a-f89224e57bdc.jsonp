That is as true today as it was in the past. A recent bit of research looked at that link during a crucial time in history, the Cretaceous Period, and did so by a fascinating method. Animals take in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide and \u201cexhale\u201d oxygen. Many plants obtain carbon dioxide through openings on their leaves, called stomata. Those openings also allow water to escape, and for many plants water is a precious resource that needs to be conserved. To save water, plants have as few stomata as they can get away with and still take in enough carbon dioxide.","published_at":1524082735,"content_id":"a4416c8e-13d0-384c-b08e-befae9e2fafe","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dispatch.com\/news\/20180415\/geology-are-we-willing-to-gamble-on-effects-of-high-carbon-dioxide-levels?rssfeed=true","content_published_at":1523768400,"content_time":1523768400,"content_relative_time":88,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":88,"comment_relative_time":88,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9fb79887-62bc-3dd0-af92-7f3976ee6a0c","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-667ddf87-e72f-39a4-af31-5bbe15fe2922_a-9fb79887-62bc-3dd0-af92-7f3976ee6a0c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-667ddf87-e72f-39a4-af31-5bbe15fe2922_a-9fb79887-62bc-3dd0-af92-7f3976ee6a0c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/fcc-issues-warning-wake-swarms-4r46nsv","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Space.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/40318-fcc-issues-warning-after-unauthorized-launch.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3tlcmrcUgCJPhzStx_Erpw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/baFkD8THaLnUP7XclB_VrQ--\/dz0xODEyO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fb79887-62bc-3dd0-af92-7f3976ee6a0c--1979404228.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MkfNrjbtbqMyvaAhMUTV6Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTgxMjs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/baFkD8THaLnUP7XclB_VrQ--\/dz0xODEyO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fb79887-62bc-3dd0-af92-7f3976ee6a0c--1979404228.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1812,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/baFkD8THaLnUP7XclB_VrQ--\/dz0xODEyO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fb79887-62bc-3dd0-af92-7f3976ee6a0c--1979404228.jpeg","imgw":1812,"imgh":1000,"title":"FCC Issues Warning in Wake of Swarm's Unauthorized Launch","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on April 12 released an enforcement advisory warning that organizations will be penalized for launching spacecraft without the appropriate regulatory approvals and advised launch providers they should be ready to remove unauthorized spacecraft from their rockets if necessary. \"Failure to comply with FCC requirements can and will result in enforcement action,\" the document states.

In research published today in Nature Communications, a group of planetary scientists provide evidence that a fragment of a meteorite may be a piece of a protoplanet that was destroyed as the solar system was forming. This early formation period was a chaotic and violent time, and the four inner solar system planets are the only survivors of a brutal series of collisions. Several protoplanets amassed together, striking each other, fragmenting, coalescing, and repeating the process to finally form the rocky planets, moons and asteroids we see today.","published_at":1524021451,"content_id":"1e959594-9d45-3204-a698-1ca66f180de1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/space\/solar-system\/a19835007\/a-meteorite-that-crashed-in-sudan-could-be-from-a-lost-planet\/","content_published_at":1523977980,"content_time":1523977980,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"749956e8-265b-376c-8f1a-e49ae5f4c746","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e274b47e-ad0b-305d-9bc5-0542116ec520_a-749956e8-265b-376c-8f1a-e49ae5f4c746","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e274b47e-ad0b-305d-9bc5-0542116ec520_a-749956e8-265b-376c-8f1a-e49ae5f4c746","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/marine-fish-won-evolutionary-lottery-y8pyxoy","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"ScienceDaily","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2018\/04\/180417155615.htm","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dZ6xl_MAyhkj6f89wW533Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ybcsEEMB1z1srneIRvmbww--\/dz01NDA7aD0zMTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_749956e8-265b-376c-8f1a-e49ae5f4c746--10398403.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TUxe_xrcgwWFr4j9ODD4Ow--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTI7dz01NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ybcsEEMB1z1srneIRvmbww--\/dz01NDA7aD0zMTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_749956e8-265b-376c-8f1a-e49ae5f4c746--10398403.jpeg","height":312,"width":540,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ybcsEEMB1z1srneIRvmbww--\/dz01NDA7aD0zMTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_749956e8-265b-376c-8f1a-e49ae5f4c746--10398403.jpeg","imgw":540,"imgh":312,"title":"Marine fish won an evolutionary lottery 66 million years ago","summary":"Slightly more than half of today's fish are \"marine fish,\" meaning they live in oceans.

(The study did not analyze the large numbers of other fish that live in lakes, rivers, streams, ponds and tropical rainforests.)

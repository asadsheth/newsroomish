This light has allowed life to evolve and flourish on our small planet, but it comes at a cost. The Sun's light is produced by fusion in the Sun's core. Hydrogen atoms combine to produce helium and light. The light is produced because the mass of a helium atom is slightly smaller than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms that formed it. As Einstein first pointed out, mass and energy can transform into each other, so the loss of mass means a gain of energy in the form of light. The light radiates from the Sun, warming our Earth, but that also means over time the Sun loses mass. The Sun consumes mass to produce light.

The bone fragments of the long-extinct fish predator were spotted on the beach at Lilstock, Somerset in May 2016, and together they measure about three feet long (96 centimeters), said the report in the journal PLOS One. After comparing them to another set of bones in Canada scientists believe they came from an ichthyosaur that was close to 26 meters long, almost the size of a blue whale.","published_at":1523341594,"content_id":"dcc0e1d3-3f21-3418-bf6f-398a8666e7af","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/jaw-bone-british-beach-belonged-huge-ancient-reptile-184059509.html","content_published_at":1523299698,"content_time":1523299698,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"26231384-c916-3fc9-8328-570163218f06","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-24d88e5d-25a2-377f-b57b-e6172e34f431_a-26231384-c916-3fc9-8328-570163218f06","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-24d88e5d-25a2-377f-b57b-e6172e34f431_a-26231384-c916-3fc9-8328-570163218f06","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/nasa-tracks-greenland-glaciers-understand-ejek4pe","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo View","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/nasa-tracks-greenland-glaciers-understand-164045435.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1PhXNhvE22NxSPVgI8ViKw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/es-US\/homerun\/yahoo_view_839\/cdce1981614eb85f5d599a97cf562c3c","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tQpLEAxT1rX6Vjmq30DT8g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yODg7dz01MTI7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/es-US\/homerun\/yahoo_view_839\/cdce1981614eb85f5d599a97cf562c3c","height":288,"width":512,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/es-US\/homerun\/yahoo_view_839\/cdce1981614eb85f5d599a97cf562c3c","imgw":512,"imgh":288,"title":"NASA tracks Greenland glaciers to understand climate change","summary":"NBC\u2019s Jacob Soboroff joined the flight for NASA\u2019s Operation IceBridge to study changes in the thickness of sea ice and glaciers.","published_at":1523324897,"content_id":"26231384-c916-3fc9-8328-570163218f06","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/nasa-tracks-greenland-glaciers-understand-164045435.html","content_published_at":1523292045,"content_time":1523292045,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

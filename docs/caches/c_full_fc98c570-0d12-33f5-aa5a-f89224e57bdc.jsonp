Mysterious, ghostlike \"whistler waves\" that are normally created by lightning could protect nuclear fusion reactors from runaway electrons, new research suggests. These whistler waves are naturally found high above ground in the ionosphere \u2014 a layer of Earth's atmosphere about 50 to 600 miles (80 an1000 kilometers) above the planet's surface. These ghostly whistler waves form when lightning bolts generate pulses of electromagnetic waves that travel between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These waves change in frequency as they cross the globe, and when these light signals are converted to audio signals, they sound like whistles.

The buried remnants of the 125-mile-wide crater have been identified on the Yucatan Peninsula and in the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists have long theorized that an initial pulse of heat was followed by a devastating global winter. After that, as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surged, the planet became a hothouse. A new study published Thursday in the journal Science has produced hard data to support that global warming hypothesis, and it may have unnerving implications","published_at":1527191164,"content_id":"7dd0fb89-1776-3dbf-8c75-0643aa911b51","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/05\/24\/study-dino-killing-comet-sparked-global-hothouse-age\/","content_published_at":1527190939,"content_time":1527190939,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-3428e5b7-b47b-37b1-8685-21a7e44b1b1a_a-9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-3428e5b7-b47b-37b1-8685-21a7e44b1b1a_a-9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/parts-brain-become-active-students-1qzhhzq","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"medicalxpress.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-05-brain-students-physics.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qvZPCSk7qlcruHfjASW3Wg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Fhvt8vjAVCrtj_tho1VafQ--\/dz0yODgwO2g9MTkyMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b-1353761479.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HGmTmvSn1PXtpOo3sO36Ow--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg4MDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Fhvt8vjAVCrtj_tho1VafQ--\/dz0yODgwO2g9MTkyMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b-1353761479.jpeg","height":1920,"width":2880,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Fhvt8vjAVCrtj_tho1VafQ--\/dz0yODgwO2g9MTkyMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b-1353761479.jpeg","imgw":2880,"imgh":1920,"title":"New parts of the brain become active after students learn physics","summary":"The researchers, led by Eric Brewe, Ph.D., an associate professor in Drexel University's College of Arts and Sciences, say this shows that the brain's activity can be modified by different forms of instruction. Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to measure blood flow in the brain, the researchers looked to map what areas become active when completing a physics reasoning task, both before a course on the concepts and after. \"The neurobiological processes that underpin learning are complex and not always directly connected to what we think it means to learn,\" Brewe said of the findings, which were published in Frontiers in ICT. More than 50 volunteer students took part in the study in which they were taught a physics course that utilized \"Modeling Instruction,\" a style of teaching which encourages students to be active participants in their learning.","published_at":1527189497,"content_id":"9fa612ac-f3e4-3bd0-ad56-848438e0aa6b","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-05-brain-students-physics.html","content_published_at":1527189165,"content_time":1527189165,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

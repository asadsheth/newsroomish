Hopefully the little feller made it through the holidays, but now what do you do with the spruce moose? It's easier to recycle your Christmas tree than you may think. Instead of hauling it out to the garbage, we have 14 suggestions that are kinder on landfills\u00a0and give your tree a second life. Mulch love: Use slow-decomposing pine needles to give your garden some TLC. Some communities even do the mulching themselves, then let residents take some home. Put a bird on it: Leave it in the stand and hang bird feeders from it. (Put it outside first, of course.)

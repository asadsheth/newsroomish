The boat was deliberately capsized, and of those 500 people, 11 survived; they were rescued four days after the sinking. Doaa was one of them and her fiance Bassem, with whom she had fled, drowned in front of her. Melissa Fleming, chief spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, heard about Doaa and the death of 489 of her fellow refugees and decided to fly to Crete to meet the girl, who had rescued a toddler when she was nearly dead herself.","published_at":1527106336,"content_id":"b41cddac-520e-32f0-bd46-1e45e6c151f7","content_url":"http:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/pti-stories\/doaa-al-zamel-a-young-syrian-woman-s-search-for-peace-118052300547_1.html","content_published_at":1527051600,"content_time":1527051600,"content_relative_time":62,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Syrian conflict","vibe_id":"543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":62,"comment_relative_time":62,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"3ef00fc7-e05c-3e46-85a8-9e31343ab17b","post_id":"v-543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6_c-20aef657-1cda-3409-97b5-a5194d458eab_a-3ef00fc7-e05c-3e46-85a8-9e31343ab17b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6_c-20aef657-1cda-3409-97b5-a5194d458eab_a-3ef00fc7-e05c-3e46-85a8-9e31343ab17b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/syrian-crisis\/doctors-ask-syria-lift-7-ban-access-wounded-3xpoy49","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/doctors-ask-syria-lift-7-ban-access-wounded-164858958.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H_hqH9j9rlxLf8nrWYxG5g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/2876652f4f278434273c588814753626169a49e0.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gI9Idm45KgP0X95uX3Z0dg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/2876652f4f278434273c588814753626169a49e0.jpg","height":682,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/2876652f4f278434273c588814753626169a49e0.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":682,"title":"Doctors ask Syria to lift 7-year ban on access to wounded","summary":"Doctors Without Borders on Wednesday called on Syria's government to reverse its seven-year ban on the medical charity, issuing an urgent appeal for access to wounded people in regime-held territory.

occupied Golan Heights, an Israeli cabinet minister said on Wednesday, predicting U.S. assent could come within months. Interviewed by Reuters, Intelligence Minister Israel Katz described endorsement of Israel's 51-year-old hold on the Golan as the proposal now \"topping the agenda\" in bilateral diplomatic talks with the United States. Any such move would be seen as a follow-up on the U.S. exit from the international nuclear deal with Iran, and President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the opening of a new U.S. embassy there this month.","published_at":1527086486,"content_id":"0783e5d0-c0b8-3775-9a62-d458ffe83aeb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-israeli-minister-says-u-may-soon-recognize-183132999.html","content_published_at":1527111733,"content_time":1527111733,"content_relative_time":45,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Syrian conflict","vibe_id":"543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":45,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

Of course, most people's St. Patrick's Day celebrations involve drinking green beer and horoing any drop of Irish blood they may or may not actually have. That's great and all, but St. Patrick's Day parades are where it's really at.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Ohio could become the 13th state to name a state dog, and the first to recognize the Labrador as such. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Jeffery Rezabek, of Clayton, says he thinks the popular breed would represent Ohio values well because it's a working dog and sporting dog. Rezabek notes that Labradors are trained as rescue dogs, police dogs and therapy dogs and are kept as family pets. He says his own family had Labradors while he was growing up.

The overlaid text describes a flight attendant telling a passenger to place their dog in a pet carrier in the overhead bin. Despite many protests, the flight attendant carried on with the pre-flight instructions, Maggie wrote. The dog remained confined for the duration of the flight and ultimately passed away; its owner found it dead upon landing. Maggie wrote that though they heard the dog barking during the flight, \"we didn't know it was barking a cry for help.\" \"She","published_at":1521336402,"content_id":"97970b65-2dcb-3dc2-85a1-ae7e658a1874","content_url":"https:\/\/www.teenvogue.com\/story\/dog-reportedly-dies-in-united-flight-overhead-bin","content_published_at":1520910300,"content_time":1520910300,"content_relative_time":184,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":184,"comment_relative_time":184,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b91a4e11-7c8a-3f68-90db-dc0929c237e9","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-1e934351-1b84-3f1f-82d2-152b5f2f9be5_a-b91a4e11-7c8a-3f68-90db-dc0929c237e9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-1e934351-1b84-3f1f-82d2-152b5f2f9be5_a-b91a4e11-7c8a-3f68-90db-dc0929c237e9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-1e934351-1b84-3f1f-82d2-152b5f2f9be5_a-b91a4e11-7c8a-3f68-90db-dc0929c237e9","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/death-puppy-united-flight-prompts-220957335.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Death of puppy on United flight prompts U.S. agency probe","summary":"United Airlines faced fresh backlash on Wednesday over a puppy that died in-flight after a cabin attendant ordered it stowed in an overhead bin, and the U.S. Department of Transportation said it was examining the events that led to the French bulldog's death. U.S. Senator John Kennedy, who earlier on Wednesday sent a letter to United Airlines President Scott Kirby demanding information on the high number of animals that have died in the carrier's care, wrote on Twitter that he planned to file a bill on Thursday that would prohibit airlines from putting animals in overhead bins. Kennedy, in his letter, said United's \"pattern of animal deaths and injuries is simply inexcusable.\" He cited figures from the Transportation Department that of the 24 animals that died on U.S. carriers last year, 18 were on United flights.","published_at":1521472944,"content_id":"b91a4e11-7c8a-3f68-90db-dc0929c237e9","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/death-puppy-united-flight-prompts-220957335.html","content_published_at":1521065397,"content_time":1521065397,"content_relative_time":141,"reaction_count":4,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":141,"comment_relative_time":141,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"dd7a4241-98ba-375d-8551-364b4f82ef6e","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-9c4df0ec-3e83-39d9-936e-46ce97a97d6c_a-dd7a4241-98ba-375d-8551-364b4f82ef6e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-9c4df0ec-3e83-39d9-936e-46ce97a97d6c_a-dd7a4241-98ba-375d-8551-364b4f82ef6e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/university-students-dogs-cuddle-during-mjewq4e","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/university-students-dogs-cuddle-during-173619127.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ffB0qBc4ddKwUrgk9Cs2Sw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/af2d0e3f51acb8763577ce6b940f259d","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/akoOBdkLiV.OoGvrwsB6jg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MDk7dz02NTQ7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/af2d0e3f51acb8763577ce6b940f259d","height":409,"width":654,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/af2d0e3f51acb8763577ce6b940f259d","imgw":654,"imgh":409,"title":"Give university students dogs to cuddle during stressful exam periods, say experts\u00a0","summary":"Providing university students with dogs during exams would help lower stress levels and help them do their best in tests, a new study has concluded. Some\u00a0institutions in Britain have already welcomed therapy dogs on to their campuses, including Leeds City College, which last week unveiled its 12-week-old cockapoo puppy called Jeffrey. But it was unclear if the animals were actually doing any good. Now a study by the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, \u00a0has found that when students are allowed to pay with and cuddle therapy dogs their stress levels plummet, and energy and happiness increase. They suggest the dogs should be brought in during exam times to help teenagers cope with the pressure. \u201cThe results were remarkable,\u201d said Dr Stanley Coren, study co-author and professor emeritus of psychology at UBC. \u201cWe found that, even 10 hours later, students still reported slightly less negative emotion, feeling more supported, and feeling less stressed, compared to students who did not take part in the therapy dog session.\u201d Come British colleges have already welcomed dogs\u00a0 Credit: University of British Columbia\u00a0 In the study published today in the journal Stress and Health, researchers surveyed 246 students before and after they spent time in a drop-in therapy dog session. Students were free to pet, cuddle and chat with up to 12 canine companions during the sessions and also filled out questionnaires immediately before and after the session, and again about 10 hours later. Researchers found that stress levels dropped by around 45 per cent, energy increased by roughly 37 per cent and happiness by 27 per cent. \u201cThese sessions clearly provide benefits for students in the short-term, so we think universities should try to schedule them during particularly stressful times, such as around exam periods,\u201d said Assistant Professor of Psychology Frances Chen. \u201cEven having therapy dogs around while students are working on their out-of-class assignments could be helpful.\u201d Dogs could be brought in during stressful periods, like exam time, say experts\u00a0 While previous research suggested female students most the new findings show the dogs benefit men as much as women. \u201cTherapy dog sessions are becoming more popular on university campuses, but there has been surprisingly little research on how much attending a single drop-in therapy dog session actually helps students,\u201d said Emma Ward-Griffin, the study\u2019s lead author and research assistant in the UBC department of psychology. \u201cOur findings suggest that therapy dog sessions have a measurable, positive effect on the wellbeing of university students, particularly on stress reduction and feelings of negativity.\u201d","published_at":1521139884,"content_id":"dd7a4241-98ba-375d-8551-364b4f82ef6e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/university-students-dogs-cuddle-during-173619127.html","content_published_at":1520876179,"content_time":1520876179,"content_relative_time":193,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":193,"comment_relative_time":193,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

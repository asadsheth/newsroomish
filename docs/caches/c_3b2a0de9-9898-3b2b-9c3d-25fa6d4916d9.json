She started the week by visiting her Border Collie friends, Lexi and Jill on the farm. They had a great time playing and fetching tennis balls together. Bailey has been working very hard this week preparing for her next big step to becoming a service dog. She leaves Thursday for Tallahassee, FL for the woman's prison. She has very big things ahead of her. This next step in her training will determine what type of service dog she will become. The TV show Time of Your Life featured Service Dogs Alabama on their show and invited Bailey to come.

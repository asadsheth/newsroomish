A bill sponsored by Rep. David Olsen (R-Downers Grove) that would change the current law to protect citizens from civil liability if they shatter a car window in an attempt to rescue an animal. As written, the Illinois Humane Care for Animals Act currently allows for \"an animal control officer, law enforcement officer, or Department Investigator\" to enter a car in which they feel an animal is in danger.

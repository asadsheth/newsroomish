A report heading to the transportation committee on Monday says amendments need to be made for the enforcement of street maintenance parking bans. According to the report, justices of the peace are interpreting the bylaw as requiring both free-standing sandwich board signs and paper signs to be posted. Administration says due to this interpretation enforcement of the bylaw has been difficult. They are asking the bylaw be updated to include the definitions of sandwich board and sign, and the rules for the posting of signs be clarified.

Chicago's Trio Animal Foundation posted a video of Possum walking around despite her leg deformities. Possum was reportedly brought to a shelter after her breeder could not find a home for her. She was later brought to the foundation for medical attention where they found she had \u201creverse tibial abnormalities,\u201d stating \u201cher long bones are essentially backwards.\u201d According to the post, the dog is also polydactyl, meaning she was born with extra toes. The foundation stated that Possum does not appear to be in pain or generally aware of her abnormalities.","published_at":1520878609,"content_id":"034fea31-63a0-379f-8d47-0cec90ee5df6","content_url":"http:\/\/www.fox29.com\/news\/siberian-husky-puppy-with-leg-deformities-rescued-by-animal-foundation","content_published_at":1520877060,"content_time":1520877060,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a239798d-cf56-3a9b-8594-237b600753df","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-e2cfea9f-2c2d-3637-ad30-32a69b043d8e_a-a239798d-cf56-3a9b-8594-237b600753df","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-e2cfea9f-2c2d-3637-ad30-32a69b043d8e_a-a239798d-cf56-3a9b-8594-237b600753df","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/graphic-content-hunt-barbaric-animal-14vvwgv","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Express.co.uk","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/nature\/930687\/Animal-cruelty-hunt-barbaric-animal-fighters-mutilated-corpses-dogs","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vqh2S1IgTwe3lqmztWibhQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rIGwsFeDXHG6j6xQqtQngw--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a239798d-cf56-3a9b-8594-237b600753df--228403743.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gTyzQdSIFVriSzGxzGYYCQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NDU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rIGwsFeDXHG6j6xQqtQngw--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a239798d-cf56-3a9b-8594-237b600753df--228403743.jpeg","height":445,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rIGwsFeDXHG6j6xQqtQngw--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a239798d-cf56-3a9b-8594-237b600753df--228403743.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":445,"title":"GRAPHIC CONTENT: Hunt for barbaric animal fighters after mutilated corpses of dogs found","summary":"The tragic animals all displayed tell-tale signs of being forced into brutal combat with their ears cropped or teeth filed down for use as \u201cbait\" animals.

Not only might your cat not appreciate being made a fool of, but could he or she even be plotting your demise? Let's take a look at two sets of research and some common sense. The first set came from a combined University of Georgia and National Geographic research team. The team strapped small cameras on house cats as part of their\u00a0Kitty Cams (Crittercam) Project, because cats just love when you put stuff on them. These cameras allowed the team and everyone who visits the Kitty Cam website to watch what cats do when you aren't watching.

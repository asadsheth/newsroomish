In research published in the March issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, researchers compared the results of PET\/CT scans to determine the efficacy of screening with copper-64 chloride, a new imaging agent, compared to fluorine-18-choline. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was also performed, and the biodistribution, kinetics of the lesions and radiation dosimetry of the new agent also were evaluated. The recurrence of prostate cancer, which grows slowly, can occur in 30 percent to 90 percent of men, depending on their high risk prostate cancer and the initial treatment the patient, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation.","published_at":1520696355,"content_id":"697a3fc8-2ff8-374d-8d32-dadf012f6a88","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Health_News\/2018\/03\/05\/New-PET-scan-imaging-agent-detects-prostate-cancer-recurrence-earlier\/3081520277185\/","content_published_at":1520281029,"content_time":1520281029,"content_relative_time":168,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":168,"comment_relative_time":168,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c1900f6e-b12f-33e0-a01a-fc881ea937e8","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-89524a90-38d7-3d4f-8aac-fdf02b50dfa4_a-c1900f6e-b12f-33e0-a01a-fc881ea937e8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-89524a90-38d7-3d4f-8aac-fdf02b50dfa4_a-c1900f6e-b12f-33e0-a01a-fc881ea937e8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-89524a90-38d7-3d4f-8aac-fdf02b50dfa4_a-c1900f6e-b12f-33e0-a01a-fc881ea937e8","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/jimmy-kimmel-jokes-barbra-streisand-183942320.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2DDmBxm2bFlFa0PtzaAh6Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/ed15c0dda16eae715350719ecd37a78f","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AWWmmbIWFzpANLMygy9w8w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzM7dz03MjI7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/ed15c0dda16eae715350719ecd37a78f","height":433,"width":722,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/ed15c0dda16eae715350719ecd37a78f","imgw":722,"imgh":433,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Jokes About Barbra Streisand's Cloned Dog, Plus More of the Best Animal Moments at the Oscars","summary":"When Jimmy Kimmel met Jimmy Kibble","published_at":1520606776,"content_id":"c1900f6e-b12f-33e0-a01a-fc881ea937e8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/jimmy-kimmel-jokes-barbra-streisand-183942320.html","content_published_at":1520275182,"content_time":1520275182,"content_relative_time":170,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":170,"comment_relative_time":170,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9b8d4efa-cc24-30c2-903c-d094b01194f4","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-a983fabd-667e-3a08-9e1d-8fabc5c80c44_a-9b8d4efa-cc24-30c2-903c-d094b01194f4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-a983fabd-667e-3a08-9e1d-8fabc5c80c44_a-9b8d4efa-cc24-30c2-903c-d094b01194f4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/3-energy-penny-stocks-watch-5tszxu9","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Money Morning -

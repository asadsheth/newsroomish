Tony Peck, 41, and wife Helen, 52, kept their four felines in filthy and cramped conditions at their home in Clifton, Nottingham. Shocking pictures show cluttered rooms covered in faeces with cans of cat food piled up almost to the ceiling. The RSPCA were contacted by a worried member of the public who raised concerns about the conditions the animals were living in. A warrant was obtained by the police after the animal charity was unable to gain access to the property to check on the animals' welfare.

Planets There Would Get Scorched","summary":"Since it's discovery was announced in August of 2016, Proxima b has been an endless source of wonder and the target of many scientific studies. In addition to being the closest extra-solar planet to our Solar System, this terrestrial planet also orbits within Proxima Centauri's circumstellar habitable zone (aka. \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d). As a result, scientists have naturally sought to determine if this planet could actually be home to extra-terrestial life. Many of these studies have been focused on whether or not Proxima b could retain an atmosphere and liquid water on its surface in light of the fact that it orbits an M-type (red dwarf) star. Unfortunately, many of these studies have revealed that","published_at":1523390670,"content_id":"7e6455c5-195f-3430-87c2-b682f2ee4814","content_url":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/138980\/proxima-centauri-just-released-a-flare-so-powerful-it-was-visible-to-the-unaided-eye-planets-there-would-get-scorched\/","content_published_at":1523389781,"content_time":1523389781,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b85d86c2-5640-3040-84f3-e0433bad9662_a-18d471fe-85ac-3a54-93d9-c84e3306f246","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/sun-losing-mass-getting-larger-2s93uzj","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/briankoberlein\/2018\/04\/10\/the-sun-is-losing-mass-and-getting-larger-at-the-same-time\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Zi3v73rgBcZ7rn1Af1vf4w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AzUvQ1MMcHSXrUkU45I2lA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_18d471fe-85ac-3a54-93d9-c84e3306f246--44642182.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EiOJUDxoOz085WYMaIu8mA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzQ7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AzUvQ1MMcHSXrUkU45I2lA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_18d471fe-85ac-3a54-93d9-c84e3306f246--44642182.jpeg","height":434,"width":640,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AzUvQ1MMcHSXrUkU45I2lA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_18d471fe-85ac-3a54-93d9-c84e3306f246--44642182.jpeg","imgw":640,"imgh":434,"title":"The Sun Is Losing Mass, And Getting Larger At The Same Time","summary":"Our Sun has provided Earth with light for billions of years. This light has allowed life to evolve and flourish on our small planet, but it comes at a cost. The Sun's light is produced by fusion in the Sun's core. Hydrogen atoms combine to produce helium and light. The light is produced because the mass of a helium atom is slightly smaller than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms that formed it. As Einstein first pointed out, mass and energy can transform into each other, so the loss of mass means a gain of energy in the form of light. The light radiates from the Sun, warming our Earth, but that also means over time the Sun loses mass. The Sun consumes mass to produce light.

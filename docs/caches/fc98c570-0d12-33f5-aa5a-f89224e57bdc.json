Having one copy of the apoE4 gene more than doubles a person's likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease, and having two copies of the gene increases the risk by 12-fold, as compared to the most common version of the gene, apoE3. The apoE4 gene creates a protein of the same name. The apoE4 protein differs from the apoE3 protein at only one point, but that single change is enough to alter its main structure and, thus, its function.

Many of the experiments involve the use of crash-test dummies, similar to the ones used by car safety designers working on ways to improve the protection of a vehicle's occupants in the event of a collision. NASA's dummies are packed with sensors that provide engineers with a slew of data from each impact test. \u201cEverything that you want to know about injury occurs anywhere from one-tenth to four-tenths of a second [during impact],\u201d explains Martin Annett, a structural impact dynamics engineer at the Langley Research Center.","published_at":1523253358,"content_id":"72969099-f252-3e99-a6a3-670a05c271d3","content_url":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/cool-tech\/nasa-crash-test-dummies\/","content_published_at":1523268401,"content_time":1523268401,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

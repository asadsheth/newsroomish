Nextbigfuture has been constantly tracking nuclear fusion and advanced nuclear fission every week for the past 13 years. The popular question is when will we have commercial nuclear fusion that has a significant impact on the energy production of the world? MIT has spunout a tokomak fusion project into Commonwealth Fusion systems. They want to apply modular designs to high-temperature superconductors. They want to get to stronger magnets that will shrink the size and cost of the potential nuclear fusion reactor. Improved magnets would improve any nuclear fusion design that involves confinement of plasma.

She spotted a little bump on Io's limb while analyzing a Voyager image and thought at first it was an undiscovered moon. Moments later she realized that wasn't possible \u2014 it would have been seen by earthbound telescopes long ago. Morabito and the Voyager team soon came to realize they were seeing a volcanic plume rising 190 miles (300 km) off the surface of Io. It was the first time in history that an active volcano had been detected beyond the Earth. For a wonderful account of the discovery, click here.

In a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, researchers concluded that since 1925, the number of marine heat wave days increased by over 50 percent annually, and the frequency of the events increased by nearly 35 percent.

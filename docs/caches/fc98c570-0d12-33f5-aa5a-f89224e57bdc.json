GRACE-FO will continue the task of the original GRACE mission, providing critical measurements that will be used with other data to monitor the movement of water masses across the planet and mass changes within the Earth itself. Monitoring changes in ice sheets and glaciers, underground water storage and sea level provides a unique view of Earth's climate and has far-reaching benefits. GRACE-FO will launch as part of a commercial rideshare","published_at":1523397980,"content_id":"5dac7e56-b153-3481-b2c0-b24de7b8be90","content_url":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/NASA-Invites-Media-to-Launch-of-GRACE-Follow-On-Spacecraft-1021093664","content_published_at":1523400900,"content_time":1523400900,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-23d17af8-af5f-346c-b3ac-c0962f0891e3_a-42af5c38-cf3d-32d3-95bd-170f749fbcb0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/saturn-moon-dione-toes-line-207b7uh","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Space.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/40263-saturn-moon-dione-rings-cassini-photo.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Rt6ZPr73VXO_oSYD6KVSBg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FyKoTftx9uoxea0SKHsqVA--\/dz0xMDA5O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_42af5c38-cf3d-32d3-95bd-170f749fbcb0-982362091.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KT095g_TY.juuZgiCmTF5g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTAwOTs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FyKoTftx9uoxea0SKHsqVA--\/dz0xMDA5O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_42af5c38-cf3d-32d3-95bd-170f749fbcb0-982362091.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1009,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FyKoTftx9uoxea0SKHsqVA--\/dz0xMDA5O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_42af5c38-cf3d-32d3-95bd-170f749fbcb0-982362091.jpeg","imgw":1009,"imgh":1000,"title":"Saturn Moon Dione Toes the Line in Stunning NASA Photo","summary":"Saturn's icy moon Dione hovers against the thin line of the gas giant's edge-on rings in a gorgeous photo by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Though NASA released the natural-color image on Monday (April 9), Cassini actually took it on Aug. 17, 2015, when the probe was about 66,200 miles (106,500 kilometers) from Dione, agency officials said.\u00a0 The photo reveals just how thin Saturn's rings are in the vertical dimension \u2014 just 30 feet (9 meters) in most places, NASA officials said. [See more of Cassini's amazing Saturn photos here] The 698-mile-wide (1,123 kilometers) Dione is Saturn's fourth-largest moon.

In addition to being the closest extra-solar planet to our Solar System, this terrestrial planet also orbits within Proxima Centauri's circumstellar habitable zone (aka. \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d). As a result, scientists have naturally sought to determine if this planet could actually be home to extra-terrestial life. Many of these studies have been focused on whether or not Proxima b could retain an atmosphere and liquid water on its surface in light of the fact that it orbits an M-type (red dwarf) star. Unfortunately, many of these studies have revealed that","published_at":1523390670,"content_id":"7e6455c5-195f-3430-87c2-b682f2ee4814","content_url":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/138980\/proxima-centauri-just-released-a-flare-so-powerful-it-was-visible-to-the-unaided-eye-planets-there-would-get-scorched\/","content_published_at":1523389781,"content_time":1523389781,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b70cf434-8454-3c39-b3d5-cf14856d54d6_a-c60b758a-6ccb-316f-a21f-daeda5907534","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/sperm-whale-found-dead-gastric-shock-29-kilos-plastic-rubbish-stomach-4m4moz5","author":"third_watch","provider":"Yahoo News UK","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/sperm-whale-found-dead-gastric-shock-29-kilos-plastic-rubbish-stomach-113740084.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BY9S0DzzYX1E9HHEji.D8A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f899376d02a72020ec0497be6a66109a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/avSBb1r9hFVBNKJyLBhr3A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NjA7dz0xMTc4Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f899376d02a72020ec0497be6a66109a","height":660,"width":1178,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f899376d02a72020ec0497be6a66109a","imgw":1178,"imgh":660,"title":"Sperm whale found dead from \u2018gastric shock\u2019 with 29 kilos of plastic rubbish in its stomach","summary":"Whales are dying in increasing numbers after ingesting plastic","published_at":1523388015,"content_id":"c60b758a-6ccb-316f-a21f-daeda5907534","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/sperm-whale-found-dead-gastric-shock-29-kilos-plastic-rubbish-stomach-113740084.html","content_published_at":1523360260,"content_time":1523360260,"content_relative_time":32,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

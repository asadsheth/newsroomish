Portland swingman Ed Davis went up for a rebound with 3:20 remaining in the frame, but failed to bring it down. Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson boxed Davis out on the play, but his body weight came down on his opponent. Ferguson took exception to Davis backing away and shoving him to the floor on the play.

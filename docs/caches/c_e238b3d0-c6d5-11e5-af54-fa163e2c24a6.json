The first move was dealing away Jordan Clarkson at the trade deadline. Not long after, the team decided to release veteran Corey Brewer and in a cruel bit of luck, rookie Josh Hart fractured a bone in his hand in practice just hours later. A strained groin has sidelined Brandon Ingram, and Kyle Kuzma missed one game with a sprained right ankle. With so many losses, head coach Luke Walton has had to turn to some unlikely faces, namely 10-day contract players Travis Wear and Derrick Williams.

Thomas and teammate Julius Randle had to be separated on the bench during Wednesday's 117-106 loss to Golden State after an on-court argument spilled over into a timeout. The pair have played well together in the 14 games since Thomas was traded to the Lakers, but that chemistry was nowhere to be found as Lonzo Ball and Brook Lopez stepped in to break up the argument. \u201cI'm a leader,\u201d Thomas said after the game, per ESPN. \u201cIt's not me getting after anybody, it's just me leading.

Brandon Jennings, signed to a 10-day contract by Milwaukee on Saturday, finished two rebounds short of a triple-double with 16 points and 12 assists. Eric Bledsoe added 14 points, including a trio of baskets to stem a fourth-quarter Memphis rally. Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 17 points, while Jarell Martin, Dillon Brooks and Ben McLemore scored 16 apiece. Memphis, which trailed by as many as 19 in the third quarter, used its bench to push back into the game in the fourth.

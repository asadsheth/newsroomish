To commemorate that milestone, Waymo, an offshoot of Google parent Alphabet, is releasing an immersive 360-degree video to let users experience the feeling of riding in a car with no driver as it navigates itself through city streets. The simulation uses footage and real-time data collected by Waymo's autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans driving around Phoenix, Ariz., where the company tests them without drivers. It has permission from regulators to carry passengers in what could be the world's first truly driverless robot taxi service but hasn't yet said when it will do so. \u201cRiders\u201d in the car will \u201csee\u201d a","published_at":1519805117,"content_id":"d3375269-533b-3790-84f4-8e2f1d120f2c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/business\/article\/Waymo-offers-virtual-reality-glimpse-at-riding-in-12715117.php?t=6ddfd0990a&cmpid=overnight","content_published_at":1519776060,"content_time":1519776060,"content_relative_time":65,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":65,"comment_relative_time":65,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1","post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-1f0e2ef5-57aa-34ca-adbf-43195e065e56_a-4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-1f0e2ef5-57aa-34ca-adbf-43195e065e56_a-4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/nose-knows-sense-smell-predicts-329u6tu","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Mail Online","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/health\/article-5442553\/Sense-SMELL-predicts-vote.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FgSB92xfHV_i4cYKIutmQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yBvCrQ4O1S8nW7MnJhqk9w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1--1943408929.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eKgvW6gW4tEjfjgTEWLvZg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODI7dz02MzY7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yBvCrQ4O1S8nW7MnJhqk9w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1--1943408929.jpeg","height":382,"width":636,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yBvCrQ4O1S8nW7MnJhqk9w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1--1943408929.jpeg","imgw":636,"imgh":382,"title":"The nose knows: Your sense of SMELL predicts how you will vote","summary":"A person's sense of smell can predict how they will vote in political elections, a new study suggests.

Get the tissues ready, this one is a doozy.\u00a0 Twitter user @ngvhi hopped online to share the most beautiful story about how she was reunited, five years later, with her sweet cat and first pet. Meet Panther.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: We're calling 'fake news' on the report that 'Black Panther' caused a surge in black cat adoptions hi I can\u2019t believe this is real because I am still in shock but my first pet ever my cat panther just came home today after going missing FIVE YEARS AGO. FIVE. YEARS. AGO. \u2014 nguhi (@ngvhi) March 16, 2018 \"Sometime after Panther went missing he apparently turned up in a shelter in the next city 15 mi away,\" she wrote. \"Days before he was going to be euthanized he was adopted! And lived with a women [sic] for a little while in yet another city.\"\u00a0 Apparently the woman who adapted Panther kept him until she couldn't any longer, and ultimately gave him to her parents\u2014who just so happened to be @ngvhi's neighbor. So, for over a year, Panther (whose name changed to Charlie) was literally living his best indoor cat life right next door. \"These happen to be the neighbors that bought a Siberian husky that quickly turned out to be too much to handle. I started taking care of him until they asked if I wanted to fully adopt him,\" she continued. Yep that's right, this story also involves a doggo. The neighbors took in her cat, unknowingly, and she ended up with their dog.\u00a0 of course I said yes which is why last year I adopted my beautiful baby boy trotsky. ALL WHILE UNBEKNOWNST TO ME MY LONG LOST CAT PANTHER WAS LIVING INDOORS. I took their dog and they took my cat. pic.twitter.com\/LkkAYKb5Hi \u2014 nguhi (@ngvhi) March 17, 2018 One day, her neighbors called to ask if they had seen a missing Charlie\u2014aka Panther. When Charlie\/Panther did turn up, Trotsky the husky (which, side note, is a perfect name) didn't freak out. \"HE ALREADY KNEW HIM. THEY\u2019D LIVED TOGETHER BEFORE,\" @ngvhi wrote.\u00a0 \"Our neighbors were as flabbergasted as us and insisted we keep him because he really was ours. we (I was overruled) decided to give him back since he was comfortable there and we already have a dog and cat,\" she tweeted.\u00a0 \"It was heartbreaking but I can\u2019t even be sad bc today was truly surreal. They\u2019ve given me permission to visit my beautiful boy whenever I\u2019d like. How is it possible that they gave me this dog I adore and have fostered my first best friend.\" you know how you lose a person or pet and you wish you had one more day with them just to let them know how much you love them and how much they mean to you?

The younger male cat, which has been named Marvel, was brought into the clinic south of Paxton on Monday by a citizen who wishes to remain anonymous. The cat's body temperature was low, too \u2014 at 96.4 degrees, compared with a normal temperature of 101 or 102, Bane said. Bane said veterinary clinic staff spent Monday cleaning up the cat \"the best we could, just so we could at least see its eyeballs.\" They also gave the cat fluids, antibiotics and pain medication and used a heating pad to raise its body temperature, and by the end of Monday the cat's temperature had risen to 102 and it was able to regulate its own temperature without the use of the heating pad.","published_at":1521683919,"content_id":"1cc2b385-758d-3a5a-91b4-1624f1b6da41","content_url":"http:\/\/www.news-gazette.com\/news\/local\/2018-03-20\/after-apparent-abuse-marvel-the-cat-dropped-clinic-horrible-condition.html","content_published_at":1521570600,"content_time":1521570600,"content_relative_time":51,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-18853858-faaa-394e-a6bc-8b2e5b7ab4c8_a-c706a061-f9ea-3a9d-8f10-ba3e92b92afa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-18853858-faaa-394e-a6bc-8b2e5b7ab4c8_a-c706a061-f9ea-3a9d-8f10-ba3e92b92afa","author":"third_watch","provider":"Winona Daily News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.winonadailynews.com\/news\/national\/fur-is-dead-animal-welfare-groups-cheer-san-francisco-ban\/image_c52c1cf8-7b3a-5eff-963b-3433291fa977.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/d7f8BpMzMvNWDSJqmYuCJw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.dSP2Xe2Slf7BeZic6qzXw--\/dz0xMTIwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c706a061-f9ea-3a9d-8f10-ba3e92b92afa-1602107639.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_D0V5l9WjEkJoTiXPW9F9Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMTIwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.dSP2Xe2Slf7BeZic6qzXw--\/dz0xMTIwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c706a061-f9ea-3a9d-8f10-ba3e92b92afa-1602107639.jpeg","height":630,"width":1120,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.dSP2Xe2Slf7BeZic6qzXw--\/dz0xMTIwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c706a061-f9ea-3a9d-8f10-ba3e92b92afa-1602107639.jpeg","imgw":1120,"imgh":630,"title":"Fur is dead: Animal welfare groups cheer San Francisco ban","summary":"This photo taken Thursday, March 15, 2018, shows West Coast Leather's vintage fox trimmed leather dress by North Beach Leather, displayed in the basement of West Coast Leather in San Francisco.

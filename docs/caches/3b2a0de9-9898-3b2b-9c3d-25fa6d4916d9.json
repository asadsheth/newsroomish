State law requires dog owners to submit a current rabies vaccination certificate when applying for the new dog tags. Expired certificates are not accepted. The fee for the two licenses, which are available in the city clerk's office at City Hall, 355 Main St., is $8 for neutered or spayed dogs and $19 for other dogs. Failure to renew a license can result in a $75 fine. Residents can also send vaccination records and checks in a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the city clerk's office, P.O.

Lt. enjoys the simple pleasures of a dog's life, including human affection and going for walks.

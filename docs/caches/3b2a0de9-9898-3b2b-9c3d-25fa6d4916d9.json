The gorilla, who had lived at the west suburban zoo for nearly 20 years, had been suffering from several chronic health ailments from aging, zoo officials said. A few weeks ago, zoo staff noticed Ramar wasn't eating. After performing several tests, staff members discovered Ramar had a partial bowel blockage from his normal diet, a common occurrence in aging patients. Though the staff helped Ramar manage these issues, he was afflicted with a number of geriatric ailments, including degenerative heart disease and degenerative arthritis.

Notably, fewer stores opened on Thanksgiving Day, said Brian Field, senior director of advisory services for ShopperTrak, who said years of data showed that opening on Thanksgiving Day pulled shopping excursions from Black Friday.

President Barack Obama opted to spend most Thanksgivings with his family in their upstairs residence at the White House, where Obama's favorite dessert -- pie -- was always abundant, in at least six different flavors. The Obama family also spent some Thanksgivings volunteering at shelters and serving food to the homeless and at-risk veterans. President George W. Bush spent his Thanksgivings in office at both Camp David and his Crawford, Texas, ranch with his family.

But it's unclear if they'll chose to target a pass catcher in free agency, the draft \u2014 or both. A talented receiver hit the open market on Tuesday when the Jaguars released Allen Hurns. Should the Eagles consider signing the 26-year-old wideout? Hurns will have a market for his services. He reportedly already has a meeting with the Cowboys on Wednesday and the Jets are trying to schedule one as well. He's young and he's shown he can produce at a high level when healthy. His best season came in 2015 when he caught 64 passes for 1,031 yards and 10 touchdowns. Hurns will probably come with a hefty price tag.

The 34-year-old linebacker was still on the Denver Broncos in 2012 when the Baltimore Ravens won, and he was on the Ravens in 2015 when the Broncos won. Now the 49ers have released him after one season, meaning that one of the greatest pass rushers of an era finds himself a free agent with plenty still left in the tank.

Although he has hiccups matching up as an edge-run defender, Landry is cut from the same cloth as Vic Beasley, boasting the three B's (burst, bend, body control) desired in a speed rusher.","published_at":1520735159,"content_id":"ab94c2b4-1222-32cb-9e81-73ed8c06a4a3","content_url":"https:\/\/sportsday.dallasnews.com\/dallas-cowboys\/cowboys\/2018\/03\/10\/nfl-draft-preview-no-myles-garrett-year-plenty-edge-rushers-could-still-tempt-cowboys","content_published_at":1520733600,"content_time":1520733600,"content_relative_time":38,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-ef1d68bb-b5ed-360f-9aa6-dcc69f0a769b_a-5f56980c-2c0c-3c3a-bee8-27ef6d71ae6a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-ef1d68bb-b5ed-360f-9aa6-dcc69f0a769b_a-5f56980c-2c0c-3c3a-bee8-27ef6d71ae6a","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Dawgs By Nature","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.dawgsbynature.com\/2018\/3\/9\/17102710\/recap-of-all-the-browns-trades-acquiring-qb-tyrod-taylor-wr-jarvis-landry-and-cb-damarious-randall","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sk3Bi8.nELQsOqPOeqfLwA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GVQMpOIvxfPlkeU0jmBu1A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5f56980c-2c0c-3c3a-bee8-27ef6d71ae6a--1598015841.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aQPIeKA4LiRPQuO_ucJkiQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GVQMpOIvxfPlkeU0jmBu1A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5f56980c-2c0c-3c3a-bee8-27ef6d71ae6a--1598015841.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GVQMpOIvxfPlkeU0jmBu1A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5f56980c-2c0c-3c3a-bee8-27ef6d71ae6a--1598015841.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"Recap of all the Browns' trades: Acquiring QB Tyrod Taylor, WR Jarvis Landry, and CB Damarious Randall","summary":"Whew!

Titans coach Mike Vrabel described backup quarterback as a \u201ccritical position\u201d at the NFL Combine, and that's certainly true for the Titans, considering injuries have prevented Mariota from playing a full 16-game","published_at":1520697781,"content_id":"4f6eb9ee-6aec-35b4-bf00-20f96e50c8b5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.knoxnews.com\/story\/sports\/nfl\/titans\/2018\/03\/10\/titans-nfl-free-agency-johnny-manziel-colin-kaepernick-teddy-bridgewater-blaine-gabbert\/412755002\/","content_published_at":1520697605,"content_time":1520697605,"content_relative_time":48,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-9aadb36f-e352-3163-90ac-9c4e2b32c85d_a-61a5259e-5360-3216-8dff-de3c3324b4d2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-9aadb36f-e352-3163-90ac-9c4e2b32c85d_a-61a5259e-5360-3216-8dff-de3c3324b4d2","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Detroit Free Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.freep.com\/story\/sports\/nfl\/lions\/2018\/03\/10\/detroit-lions-2018-nfl-free-agency\/410229002\/?src=rss&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it%3Fsrc%3Drss","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sr6nyzsnnuy3A9DWiBHBFg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xffrjG0OaT4tv.hQco4Kjw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_61a5259e-5360-3216-8dff-de3c3324b4d2-648291963.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/u7BRl3N4FKkNjZmJ0Ub68Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xffrjG0OaT4tv.hQco4Kjw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_61a5259e-5360-3216-8dff-de3c3324b4d2-648291963.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xffrjG0OaT4tv.hQco4Kjw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_61a5259e-5360-3216-8dff-de3c3324b4d2-648291963.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"NFL free agency: Could Detroit Lions land Richard Sherman or Malcolm Butler?","summary":"A quick breakdown of 10 starter-level free agents who may interest the Detroit Lions when the new NFL league year begins March 14.

The move cannot become official until the new league year begins on March 14. Bennett was owed a $3-million roster bonus had he been with the Seahawks on March 18. By trading him, the Seahawks will save $2.2 million against the salary cap.

News emerged Wednesday afternoon that Sherman had been saying his goodbyes to teammates this week, and that broke moments before Bennett, who had very publicly been on the trading block, was sent to Philadelphia (along with a seventh-round pick) for a fifth-rounder and receiver Marcus Johnson.Seahawks coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider have tried to prepare their fans for this eventuality, with their most recent attempts coming at last week\u2019s combine.\u201cEvery offseason we approach it the same way: to compete as hard as we can to figure out the best ways to put our guys in the right positions, to do the right things, to make the right choices, to stay abreast at what\u2019s going on in the league,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cAnd sometimes you\u2019ve got to make some tough calls to get that done and put it in the right order. I really feel confident that we\u2019ve done that. But there is a lot of work here, a lot of stuff to get better on before we figure all that out.\u201dSaid Schneider: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss any opportunity and that\u2019s how we built this thing and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to build it. Now, do we have some challenges this year? Absolutely. We\u2019re pretty disappointed the way the season ended. We went 9-7 and you would have thought that we won two games. It\u2019s a pit that sits in your stomach and really fuels you. We\u2019re excited about the challenges ahead because we feel like we want to get rolling on this thing.\u201dWhat should be particularly troubling for 12s is the seemingly few opportunities the Seahawks will have to rebuild quickly. First, a look at the landscape in the NFC West:\u2022 The 49ers have one of the league\u2019s best offensive play-callers as their head coach, paired with one of the best young quarterbacks in the league. And they\u2019re coming off a December in which they beat three playoff-bound teams in consecutive weeks.\u2022 The Rams have the reigning Coach of the Year, Offensive Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year and just traded for a cornerback (Marcus Peters) who has created 24 turnovers in his first three seasons.\u2022 The Cardinals have a first-year head coach and no quarterback to speak of. But they have as talented a roster today, sans quarterback, as the Seahawks do. \u2022 FREE AGENCY TRACKER: A position-by-position ranking of who\u2019s available next week.And where is Seattle\u2019s capital to build through either free agency or the draft? Including rollover, the Seahawks have $177.747 million to spend in 2018. Only four teams have less (though that comes before a possible Sherman release, which would free up $11 million).If the Seahawks plan to build through the draft, they don\u2019t have many chances there, either. Seattle owns just two of the first 120 picks: Nos. 18 and 120. That\u2019s one first and one fourth in the first four rounds.\u201cSo it\u2019s kind of a fun challenge now,\u201d said Schneider of his draft situation, apparently employing one of the lesser-used definitions of \u201cfun.\u201dTo be sure, the cupboard is not bare, and the Seahawks are not totally hitting the reset button in 2018. They still have one of the best players in the league at the most important position in sports, which accounts for a lot, even if Russell Wilson is currently participating in a spring training charade. Seattle reportedly wants to extend Earl Thomas, and though the Seahawks did not tag Sheldon Richardson, a deal can still be worked out.But the Seahawks are still left with a poor offensive line that they\u2019ve tried\u2014and failed\u2014to build for as long as they\u2019ve been dominant. And even those remaining pieces will have to get acclimated to new coordinators on either side of the ball. \u2022 NFL DRAFT BIG BOARD: Post-combine, the top 100 prospects for the 2018 draft.At the combine, Schneider recalled how the team built its success by playing their top players now, right away then. He listed off Sherman, Thomas, Byron Maxwell, Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright all being thrown into the fire immediately. Then he began to lament, as many in his generation do, the players coming in today who evidently have a different perspective.\u201cYou are getting to the point where we are interviewing these guys at the combine, or you are at the school interviewing them, and they are thinking to themselves, \u2018Wow, I get to play with Kam Chancellor?\u2019 No, you get to compete with Kam Chancellor.\u201cThat\u2019s the mindset we have to get back to. They are a little bit in awe, you know. You know, they were in eighth grade.\u201dThis Seahawks core has been known to some of the 2018 draft prospects since middle school. But the team taking CenturyLink Field next fall will be harder to recognize. \u2022 Question or comment?

A challenge the Rams are in the process of dealing with as they approach a season that has many mentioning them and the Super Bowl in the same sentence. It's why they need Sean Mannion to be more like Nick Foles than Matt McGloin or Connor Cook if, heaven forbid, something happened to Jared Goff (a distinction that, for obvious reasons, they'd gladly

The result: Carr face-planted, tossing just 22 touchdowns, a career-high 13 picks, and fell short of 3,500 yards. He was one of the biggest fantasy football busts of the 2017 season.

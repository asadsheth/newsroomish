They also were confused with the fact that Jimmy Garoppolo was ranked 8th overall and that Marcus Mariota was 11th overall. Other interesting rankings were Cam Newton at 19th overall behind some questionable names, Blake Bortles at 21st overall, Alex Smith at 23rd overall and two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning at 30th overall.\u00a0","published_at":1528666511,"content_id":"b1acce34-a8ac-3f29-9d4f-2329e6d92184","content_url":"https:\/\/929thegame.radio.com\/articles\/chuckery-and-mcmichael-qb-rankings-roethlisberger-and-wentz-should-not-be-ahead-ryan","content_published_at":1528648309,"content_time":1528648309,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-c41d94c9-f781-357c-8191-1fed41dfe7ce_a-cde925a2-89c6-35d0-b380-3d79130b6e81","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/real-prediction-49ers-2018-season-4lrt071","author":"nanook","provider":"Niners Nation","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.ninersnation.com\/2018\/6\/10\/17446564\/what-is-a-real-prediction-for-the-49ers-2018-season-here-are-weeks-5","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BGLhukdNgfFpLsBnyp_OYw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zjDIZgZehLG6CrSfBw4XQQ--\/dz00MDA7aD0zMjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cde925a2-89c6-35d0-b380-3d79130b6e81-393421073.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H4FcGmAk1iwaWxmRcv1SlQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMjA7dz00MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zjDIZgZehLG6CrSfBw4XQQ--\/dz00MDA7aD0zMjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cde925a2-89c6-35d0-b380-3d79130b6e81-393421073.jpeg","height":320,"width":400,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zjDIZgZehLG6CrSfBw4XQQ--\/dz00MDA7aD0zMjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cde925a2-89c6-35d0-b380-3d79130b6e81-393421073.jpeg","imgw":400,"imgh":320,"title":"What is a real prediction for the 49ers 2018 Season?

Remember the Dak Prescott vs. Carson Wentz debates from the summer of 2017? It's a good lesson in not overreacting to a rookie season, especially at the quarterback position.

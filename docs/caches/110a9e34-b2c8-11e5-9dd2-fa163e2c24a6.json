(AP) - The NBA's reigning Rookie of the Year has joined a two-time Super Bowl champion to rally support for clean water, a cause dear to both University of Virginia alumni. Milwaukee Bucks player Malcolm Brogdon announced Thursday that he'll be the first NBA ambassador for Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Chris Long's Waterboys Initiative, which installs deep-borehole wells in east Africa.

Subscribe!QUARTERBACKS DIFFERENCE MAKERS NOTE: Drew Brees is technically a free agent, but it is a virtual certainty he will be retained by the Saints. Kirk Cousins (29), WashingtonIt\u2019s unusual to see a quality starting quarterback available in free agency, it\u2019s unheard of for that quarterback to the hit the market in a year when multiple teams (Denver, Minnesota and Jacksonville) have powerhouse defenses that leave them just a QB away from Super Bowl contention. Urgency by those teams could push Cousins\u2019 value through the ethers. As for teams who are more than just a QB away, buyer beware: Cousins is an excellent plug-and-play system guy, but he\u2019s not someone you build your system around. Case Keenum (30), VikingsHis greatness in 2017 was legitimate\u2014he made plays not just by executing Pat Shurmur\u2019s shrewd designs, but also by improvising when those designs didn\u2019t work. What teams must decide is: Can Keenum do it again, this time without Shurmur? OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Josh McCown (39), JetsQuietly, McCown had a stellar 2017 campaign in New York (94.5 passer rating). He\u2019s still a viable bridge guy, and maybe even an inexpensive option for a \u201cready to win now\u201d team that loses out on Cousins. Tom Savage (27), TexansHe must get more consistent in all facets, but at least he\u2019s willing to stand tall in the pocket. That gives him long-term value as a backup; coaches will believe he can keep their system afloat if he has to come off the bench. AJ McCarron (27), BengalsThe dearth of quality NFL quarterbacks has created a misconception around him. Maybe he is a diamond in the rough. But what there is no maybe about is that he has been the backup behind a very average quarterback for several years. Sam Bradford (30), VikingsThe most talented QB in free agency, but unfortunately the durability concerns have become overwhelming. Jay Cutler (34), DolphinsIf he wasn\u2019t great in an Adam Gase scheme that he\u2019d thrived in before, what makes you think he\u2019d thrive somewhere else? Mike Glennon (28), BearsLet\u2019s not underestimate the value of a solid, qualified backup. Brock Osweiler (27), BroncosHis agents should dismiss his 2016 season in Houston and \u201917 season in Cleveland\/Denver and sell him as the high-end backup who helped keep the 2015 Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl season on track. If they believe a starting job might still be in his future, then sign a one-year contract for 2018. If they want long-term stability, they\u2019ll pursue a long-term contract as a No. 2. Geno Smith (27), GiantsSmith is a capable deep-intermediate passer and serviceable enough athlete, but with backup QBs, dependability is more important than talent. That works against Smith. Teddy Bridgewater (25), VikingsHe hasn\u2019t played in two years and he had arm strength limitations before he got injured. Matt Barkley (27), CardinalsTurnovers are a concern, but he had some productive outings in Chicago two seasons ago. Blaine Gabbert (28), CardinalsWhen the pocket is clean, he looks the part. But when the pocket becomes the least bit dirty, or even just threatens to be dirty, he\u2019s a wildcard. Matt Moore (33), DolphinsA proven backup, his landing spot could be decided by how teams view him as a mentor. Ryan Fitzpatrick (35), BucsHis next contract will likely make him just the fourth QB in history to play for a quarter of the NFL\u2019s teams. (The others: Josh Johnson, Josh McCown and J.T. O\u2019Sullivan.) Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Matt Cassel (Titans), Andy Dalton (Bengals), Matt Schaub (Falcons), Tyrod Taylor (Bills)RUNNING BACKS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Le'Veon Bell (26), SteelersStill the best out-of-backfield creator in football, but would you believe Bell\u2019s longest run last year gained just 27 yards? (UPDATE: Bell has been franchise-tagged by the Steelers.) Carlos Hyde (27), 49ersNot a dynamic receiving threat, but Hyde is a good enough first- and second-down runner to warrant three-down starter money on the open market. Isaiah Crowell (25), BrownsA sustaining ballcarrier who has a touch more speed and power than you\u2019d guess. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Dion Lewis (27), PatriotsLewis is a reliable, professional runner. What will be interesting is whether teams see him as a potential receiving threat. He didn\u2019t have to be that in New England thanks to James White, but Lewis\u2019s shifty quickness suggests he could be that kind of threat for a different team. Rex Burkhead (27), PatriotsHis James White-style skillset can add dimension to an offense. That makes him more valuable to teams with smart veteran QBs who can take advantage. Frank Gore (34), ColtsHe can still slither through small cracks as a first- and second-down runner, though that\u2019s the extent of his abilities at this point. Jerick McKinnon (25), VikingsHis production in Minnesota never quite matched his scat back attributes, but could the right team and system change that? LeGarrette Blount (31), EaglesHe\u2019s like an old pickup truck that looks worn down but still runs and hauls just fine. Blount is much more valuable in an interior run scheme, which shortens his list of suitors. Damian Williams (25), DolphinsA viable receiver who can align almost anywhere in the formation. Chris Ivory (29)\u2014Signed With Bills (two years, $5.5 million)Still a tenacious, difficult-to-tackle runner, especially if he\u2019s fresh in a No. 2 role. Shane Vereen (29), GiantsA viable receiver, though mostly just out of the backfield (and maybe the slot). Charles Sims (27), BucsYet another pass-catching back, and with more lateral agility than Williams or Vereen. Sims is coming off a disconcertingly quiet 2017 campaign, though. Terrance West (27), RavensHis running style fits most systems, but occasional indecisiveness is a concern. Doug Martin (29), BucsHe possess excellent short-area vision and movement skills, especially in heavy traffic. The question is what to make of his: (1) injuries, (2) off-field issues and (3) 2.9 YPC over each of the last two years? Orleans Darkwa (26), GiantsHe flashes intriguing short-area east-west movement and some stop-start ability, but it never quite came together in New York. Jeremy Hill (25), BengalsWill his 1,124-yard, 5.1-ypc rookie season from 2014 lead a team to take a flyer? Or will that success only make eyebrows scrunch even further when looking at his disappointing 2015, \u201916 and \u201917 seasons? Jonathan Stewart (30), PanthersMaybe not what he once was physically, but he has always been a cerebral player who just knows how to run. With the right O-line and quarterback, he can be an effective in a No. 2 role. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): C.J. Anderson (Broncos), Mike Gillislee (Patriots), Marshawn Lynch (Raiders), Lamar Miller (Texans), DeMarco Murray (Titans), Latavius Murray (Vikings), Adrian Peterson (Cardinals), Bilal Powell (Jets), Robert Turbin (Colts), T.J. Yeldon (Jaguars) FULLBACKS SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Anthony Sherman (29), ChiefsHe can handle the ball in select situations, giving some small, pleasantly surprising oomph to an offense\u2019s two-back packages. Mike Tolbert (32), BillsHe\u2019s no longer the wrecking ball runner he was in the early 2010s, and he has never been a pure lead-blocker. Zach Line (27), SaintsPrototypical plug-in fullback. Derrick Coleman (27), FalconsAnother plug-in fullback, just not quite as strong or dependable as Line.WIDE RECEIVERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Jarvis Landry (25), DolphinsAs an excellent short-area receiver who can also threaten intermediately inside, he can certainly enhance a quick-strike offense. The question is whether teams think he can upgrade a more traditional offense, sort of like Golden Tate did in Detroit. There are questions about maturity and route running discipline. (UPDATE: Landry has been franchise-tagged by the Dolphins.) Sammy Watkins (24), RamsCertainly better than his 593 yards in 2017 suggest, but he\u2019s not a true No. 1 receiver. If he avoids the franchise tag, his open market value will be fascinating to see. Allen Robinson (24), JaguarsTwo concerns: He\u2019s coming off an ACL injury, and he was bad against press coverage in 2016. But prior to that, he was as intriguing of a downfield perimeter receiver as you\u2019ll find. Someone will risk big money in hopes of capturing that. John Brown (27), CardinalsSpeed and stop-start quickness can make him lethal \u2026 if he stays healthy enough to consistently display it. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Paul Richardson (25), SeahawksAn acrobatic vertical receiver who is tough to evaluate as an every-down weapon given that he comes from an unusual Russell Wilson-led Seahawks offense. Jaron Brown (28), CardinalsCoaches love plugging in track star wideouts because of how they can control safeties. That opens up the rest of your designs. Dontrelle Inman (29), BearsFrom a mechanical standpoint, he\u2019s one of football\u2019s 10 best route runners. Danny Amendola (32), PatriotsAt times was invaluable in his slot role with New England. Many teams will fear that\u2019s the extent of what he can offer, though. Marqise Lee (26), JaguarsHe can be very good underneath (especially on crossing patterns), but he needs clean access off the line of scrimmage. The fact that he\u2019s not quite a pure slot receiver complicates things. Taylor Gabriel (27), FalconsA worthwhile No. 4, and maybe a No. 3, since he infuses an offense with speed. Donte Moncrief (24), ColtsUltimately a disappointment in Indy, but he has a neat enough toolkit for someone to take a short-term gamble on. Jordan Matthews (25), BillsA big, slow interior possession target. There are places for him, but not as many as there were 20 years ago. Albert Wilson (25), ChiefsCan run complimentary dig and corner routes as part of a multi-receiver design. Mike Wallace (31), RavensPresents only two things to defend: go routes (which he executes speedily but inconsistently) and shallow crossing routes. Ryan Grant (27), WashingtonHe possesses subtle shiftiness, but not enough to be much more than a puzzle piece. Terrelle Pryor (28), WashingtonHis regression in Washington was disappointing and off-putting. He\u2019s at his best running in-breaking routes, but we haven\u2019t\u2019 seen that since his 2016 season in Cleveland. Eric Decker (31), TitansEvery now and then he separates on the outside thanks to deceptive mechanics, but you sign him for his ability to beat zone coverage from the slot. Kendall Wright (28), BearsNot quite shifty enough to create matchup problems in the slot, and not quite big or polished enough to regularly contribute outside. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Dez Bryant (Cowboys), Randall Cobb (Packers), Michael Crabtree (Raiders), Allen Hurns (Jaguars), Brandon LaFell (Bengals), Jeremy Maclin (Ravens), Brandon Marshall (Giants), Jordy Nelson (Packers), Emmanuel Sanders (Broncos), Torrey Smith (Eagles), Markus Wheaton (Bears)TIGHT ENDS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Jimmy Graham (31), SeahawksIf teams believe he can still win out wide and from the slot, a contender could pay big money in hopes of pushing their offense over the edge. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Tyler Eifert (27), BengalsAs athletic and versatile as almost any tight end, but 41 missed games in five seasons raise a big red flag. Trey Burton (26), EaglesHe brings value to an offense that features multiple tight ends because he can operate from anywhere inside the painted field numbers. Antonio Gates (37), ChargersWatching him run these days is not unlike watching frozen honey leave that plastic bear-shaped bottle, but remember: Defenders must react to his tempo. They all can, but not all of them can handle his savvy, nuanced mechanics. Luke Willson (28), SeahawksA plug-and-play No. 2 tight end who can work in almost any package. Virgil Green (29), BroncosHe has become much more of a blocker than receiver. Will teams see him as an H-back? Richard Rodgers (26), PackersSoft hands, but not much twitch or power. Anthony Fasano (33), DolphinsOne of those guys who keeps getting on the field because coaches know he won\u2019t make mistakes. Austin Seferian-Jenkins (25), JetsDon\u2019t fall for his flirtations. Ben Watson (37), RavensIf a team needs a No. 2 receiving tight end who can learn a playbook quickly, his career will continue. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Dwayne Allen (Patriots), Brent Celek (Eagles), Eric Ebron (Lions), James Hanna (Cowboys), Vance McDonald (Steelers), Julius Thomas (Dolphins)OFFENSIVE TACKLES DIFFERENCE MAKERS Nate Solder (29), PatriotsHe\u2019s too up-and-down in pass protection to be elite, but has the nimbleness to continue being a quality starting left tackle. Justin Pugh (27), GiantsHis stubbier body type lends itself better to guard, but he brings decent athleticism to the right tackle position, which is better than what most teams have. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Chris Hubbard (26), SteelersThe Steelers did not miss a beat when he filled in for injured\/suspended right tackle Marcus Gilbert for 10 games last season. Cameron Fleming (25), PatriotsHe improved steadily as a backup the last few years in New England. Will someone take a flyer hoping he\u2019s the next Marcus Cannon? LaAdrian Waddle (26), PatriotsHe\u2019s too lumbering to ever be more than a plug-in right tackle, but to his immense credit, he was a very reliable plug-in right tackle for the Pats in 2017. James Hurst (26), RavensHe has the body of a tackle, but not the body control. Ideally, you\u2019re signing him to be a utility backup. Andre Smith (31), BengalsYou have to assume he\u2019ll play no more than 10 games. But hey, at least he can play those games at any position (except center). Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Duane Brown (Seahawks), Bryan Bulaga (Packers), Cordy Glenn (Bills), Zach Strief (Saints), Jared Veldheer (Cardinals), Menelik Watson (Broncos)GUARDS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Andrew Norwell (26), PanthersNot as good as his befuddling first-team All-Pro accolade suggests, but he plays with the balance, dexterity and physical strength to improve a team\u2019s man-blocking running game. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Jack Mewhort (26), ColtsA solid, reliable starter \u2026 if he can stay on the field. He has missed 17 games over the last two years. Josh Kline (28), TitansHe\u2019ll be as good as the guys around him. Josh Sitton (31), BearsHe\u2019s in decline but not washed up, and his ability to play anywhere along the interior expands his market. Shawn Lauvao (30), WashingtonHe can be vulnerable in pass protection, but is a decent mover for his size, which boosts a zone-running game and backfield screen game. Zach Fulton (26), ChiefsHe quietly started 46 games in four years with the Chiefs. Some team that\u2019s solid up front but has been shaky at one of its guard spots will want him. D.J. Fluker (27), GiantsIt\u2019s hard to understand how a player with his size and north\/south plowing ability hasn\u2019t had a better career. Jonathan Cooper (28), CowboysHe was surprisingly sturdy in Dallas, where he played between superstars Tyron Smith and Travis Frederick. History says he\u2019ll disappoint if not playing under such favorable circumstances. Kevin Pamphile (27), BucsLast season he had several highlight reel plays, both for the offense and defense. Senio Kelemete (27), SaintsHe held up admirably as a fill-in guy for many years in New Orleans. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Jeff Allen (Texans), Zane Beadles (49ers), Ronald Leary (Broncos), Andy Levitre (Falcons)CENTERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Weston Richburg (26), GiantsA very good second-level blocker, and he has the necessary athleticism to get out in front on most screens. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Spencer Long (27), WashingtonOne of the league\u2019s better-moving centers. Can be a quality starter in an outside zone run-based offense? John Sullivan (32), RamsHis football IQ is off the charts, which was huge for the Rams and young QB Jared Goff last year. Travis Swanson (27), LionsHe has the tools of a first-stringer, but has missed two, four and five games over the last three seasons. Ryan Jensen (26), RavensHe\u2019s a fighter, which some believe is enough to make you a quality interior O-line starter. Russell Bodine (25), BengalsOver the last two years he had too many negative plays, particularly in the running game and against designer pass-rush tactics. Potential Cap Casualty: Joe Hawley (Bucs)EDGE PLAYERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Demarcus Lawrence (25)\u2014Signed franchise tag tender with Cowboys (one year, $17 million)There\u2019s almost zero chance he gets past the franchise tag. Too bad for teams needing a proven edge guy\u2014the gap between Lawrence and No. 2 (Ziggy Ansah) is substantial. Ezekiel Ansah (28), LionsLong and talented, but also injury-prone and enigmatic. In 2016 he was excellent but had only two sacks. In 2017, he was subpar (by star standards) but had 12 sacks. It will be fascinating to see what kind of offers he draws. (UPDATE: Ansah has been franchise-tagged by the Lions.) OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Julius Peppers (38), PanthersAccording to his age, he should be washed up. But that\u2019s been true for five years now. As a situational pass rusher, he\u2019s still in the NFL\u2019s upper echelon. Alex Okafor (27), SaintsHe was having a career year in New Orleans before tearing his Achilles last November. Trent Murphy (27), WashingtonHe needs to be in a hybrid 3-4 style scheme that allows him to align in different positions, a la Jarret Johnson for the Ravens in the 2000s. Barkevious Mingo (27), ColtsWarning to potential suitors: Don\u2019t think you can be the one who finally turns him into a true edge rusher. He found his home as a move-around joker piece for the Colts last year, where he had responsibilities as a blitzer, spy and occasional zone coverage dropper. That must be his permanent role. Adrian Clayborn (29), FalconsA disruptive in-line run defender who can also make noise as a pass rusher (especially against an overmatched backup left tackle!). Connor Barwin (31), RamsAt this point he\u2019s the duct tape or WD-40 of football players. As a complementary short-term problem-solving piece, and he\u2019s excellent, both in a 4-3 and a 3-4. But if you need a building block (even a short-term one), look elsewhere. Jerry Attaochu (25), ChargersHe never fully blossomed as a Charger, in part due to injury. He has loose hips, a long frame and supple body control. Could he be a Jerry Hughes-type who finds his footing midway through his career? Kony Ealy (26), JetsOr could he be a Jerry Hughes type? The Patriots and Jets already took a chance on Ealy, and determined no. He\u2019s hoping one more team will give it a shot. Pernell McPhee (29), BearsA viable rotational piece who can attack inside or outside, especially on designer pass rush tactics like stunts and twists. Durability is a concern. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Cliff Avril (Seahawks), Robert Ayers (Bucs), Allen Bailey (Chiefs), Elvis Dumervil (49ers), Tamba Hali (Chiefs), Clay Matthews (Packers), Shea McClellin (Patriots), Brooks Reed (Falcons), Terrell Suggs (Ravens), Cameron Wake (Dolphins), Willie Young (Bears)DEFENSIVE LINEMEN DIFFERENCE MAKERS Star Lotulelei (28), PanthersHe possesses excellent short-area power and the athleticism to shoot gaps as a pass rusher. He\u2019s not Fletcher Cox or Aaron Donald, but he could be the missing piece that makes a good defensive line great. Sheldon Richardson (27), SeahawksThe talent is irrefutable. The question is, given his history, who wants to make him uber-rich and then hope he grows up? OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Muhammad Wilkerson (28), JetsThe question is: Did he fall off in New York because he got injured, or because he got paid? Or was it both? Does it even matter? Immense talent makes him worth the gamble, but only at a reasonable price. Dontari Poe (27), FalconsThe Falcons sold him on their team last year by arguing that their scheme would increase his opportunities to get upfield and accumulate value-rising sacks. It didn\u2019t quite go that way\u2014he had 2.5 sacks on the season\u2014but plenty of teams will still want his combination of size and light feet. Shamar Stephen (27), VikingsAn above-average run defender who blended in along Minnesota\u2019s rich defensive line, someone could pay him surprisingly big money to become a fulltime starter. Bennie Logan (28), ChiefsHis quiet season in Kansas City suggests he\u2019s better suited for a 4-3 nose-shade role, as opposed to a true nose tackle or 3-4 defensive end role. For multiple years as a nose shade, his lateral movement ability brought unique playmaking prowess to Philly\u2019s run defense. DaQuan Jones (26), TitansHe can beat bad blockers off the snap, and at times he has flashed as a run defender. Kyle Williams (34), BillsThe wear and tear of 12 outstanding seasons will make some teams leery. But there will be others who trust that his tenacity and technique can produce a 13th outstanding season. Brent Urban (26)\u2014Re-signed With Ravens (one-year deal)He was quietly one of football\u2019s better run-stoppers before his Week 3 Lisfranc injury last year. Denico Autry (27), RaidersHas shown intriguing traits as a pass rusher, though not often enough to warrant big long-term money. If the market proves soft, would he bet on himself with a one-year deal? One thing\u2019s certain: He\u2019ll maximize his value wherever he goes. His effort always stands out on film. Tyrunn Walker (28), RamsHe only played 15-20 snaps a game off the bench, but always stood out on film. Haloti Ngata (34), LionsThe Lions run defense went kerplunk after he tore his biceps in Week 5. Durability and age are a concern, but all it takes is one team to believe he can compensate with his considerable football IQ. Chris Baker (30), BucsA better pass rusher than his body type suggests, though didn\u2019t produce nearly enough here in Tampa Bay. Jay Bromley (25), GiantsHe was a steady puzzle piece along a strong run-stopping interior Giants D-line. Justin Ellis (27), RaidersLittle more than a space-eater. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Tyson Alualu (Steelers), Sharrif Floyd (Vikings), Abry Jones (Jaguars), Brandon Mebane (Chargers), Domata Peko (Broncos), Ndamukong Suh (Dolphins)STACK LINEBACKERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Nigel Bradham (28), EaglesHe has developed into a quality three-down contributor with some playmaking prowess, both in run and pass D. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Tahir Whitehead (27), LionsHe can be very disruptive when pinning his ears back and pursuing the ball\u2014needs to be a piece in a linebacking unit, not its headliner. Avery Williamson (26), TitansHe rarely came off the field in Tennessee thanks to his gap-soundness in run D and serviceability against the pass. NaVorro Bowman (29), RaidersIt\u2019s hard to imagine the Raiders not making a strong run at re-signing him given the way he saved their decrepit linebacking corps last year. It is, however, a new coaching staff there\u2026 Zach Brown (28), WashingtonHis pursuit speed is excellent, but he\u2019s not immune to misreads. Paul Posluszny (33), JaguarsHe doesn\u2019t run like he used to, but is so smart and fundamentally sound (flawless?) that it often doesn\u2019t matter. Todd Davis (25), BroncosHe\u2019s higher on this list because he\u2019s so stingy against the run, but his vulnerability in coverage could leave him with less money than guys below him (like Hitchens, Pierre-Louis and maybe even Bynes). Jerell Freeman (31), BearsHis flashing downhill burst can, at times, make him look almost as good as any \u2018backer in the league. Anthony Hitchens (25), CowboysThe talent is evident, but he couldn\u2019t secure an every-down role last season. Why? Preston Brown (25), BillsAverage in every sense of the word. Demario Davis (29), JetsHe\u2019s too young to be washing up, but where was he down the stretch? Karlos Dansby (36), CardinalsOne of those guys who does everything right, which makes coaches comfortable. That\u2019s why he\u2019ll always crack the starting lineup if he\u2019s on the roster. Kevin Pierre-Louis (26), ChiefsKansas City\u2019s defense at times looked better when he rotated in for an aging Derrick Johnson. Jon Bostic (26), ColtsHe\u2019s by no means dynamic, but has developed good awareness in zone coverage. Josh Bynes (28), LionsMultiple times for the Lions and Cardinals he did a stellar job as a fill-in first-teamer. He\u2019s worth considering as a passing-down specialist. Will Compton (28), WashingtonA few times he\u2019s earned playing time ahead of more talented players. He\u2019s worth signing as a source of quality depth. Christian Jones (27), BearsMost of his snaps have come as a passing-down specialist. Given how much nickel teams play these days, could he garner low-end starter money? Devon Kennard (26), GiantsBrings value as a strong-side \u2019backer who can get physical with tight ends off the snap. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Ray-Ray Armstrong (Giants), David Harris (Patriots), Derrick Johnson (Chiefs), Vincent Rey (Bengals), Lawrence Timmons (Dolphins)CORNERBACKS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Trumaine Johnson (28), RamsHe has traveled with No. 1 receivers at times in recent years and won more battles than he\u2019s lost. That he can travel in man and zone coverage should raise his value. Malcolm Butler (28), PatriotsDid you know he didn\u2019t play in Super Bowl LII? Teams will find out what\u2019s behind that and shape their offer accordingly. If he has a clean image, he\u2019ll get top-10 corner money. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Vontae Davis (29)\u2014Signed With Bills (one year, $5 million)Injuries have become so routine that it\u2019s hard to envision anyone offering him more than No. 2 money, even though, when he\u2019s healthy, his physical nature can contest with many No. 1s. Aaron Colvin (26), JaguarsHe\u2019s overshadowed by the litany of stars on Jacksonville\u2019s defense, but a closer look reveals him as one of the league\u2019s best slot corners. That\u2019s an important\u2014and difficult\u2014position to fill. Kyle Fuller (26), BearsHis first year in Chicago was tremendous, and so was much of his last. It\u2019s those years in between that might make teams slow to pull the trigger. Whoever signs him will be getting a quality ball-in-air outside defender. (UPDATE: Fuller has received the transition tag from the Bears.) Patrick Robinson (30), EaglesHe was one of football\u2019s best slot defenders. The Eagles have youth and depth at corner, but they may want to think long and hard before letting him go. Morris Claiborne (28), JetsHad some nice stretches as the Jets\u2019 top cover corner last season. A team in need of a No. 2, especially if it runs a mostly zone-based scheme, will want him. Rashaan Melvin (28), ColtsHe performed admirably in difficult circumstances for the Colts last season. He did that down the stretch for Baltimore a few years ago, too. E.J. Gaines (26), BillsHe\u2019s experienced in a wide range of schemes, both outside and in the slot. David Amerson (26)\u2014Signed With Chiefs (one year, $2.25 million)He had a great stretch in the second half of 2016, but has been erratic for much of his six-year career. Nickell Robey-Coleman (26), RamsHe\u2019s at his best in attack-mode, including on slot blitzes. Considering this and his adequacy in man coverage, a pressure-based defense should want him. Prince Amukamara (28), BearsIdeally, he\u2019s your No. 4 corner, giving you confidence that your defense could survive if a starting outside corner were out for a few weeks. Nevin Lawson (26), LionsAnother nice plug-in guy who could add valuable depth, especially given that he has the body to play outside or in the slot. Bashaud Breeland (26), WashingtonAbout as up-and-down as they come. What that means for his open market value remains to be seen. Leonard Johnson (28), BillsIt seems like he\u2019s become an off-the-street midseason slot starter every year of his career. Was his solid 2017 season in Buffalo enough to get him a permanent home? Dontae Johnson (26), 49ersHe had too many bad plays in downfield coverage last season. He should consider taking a one-year \u201cprove it\u201d deal and hope to bounce back. Ross Cockrell (26), GiantsHe has played significant snaps in matchup zone schemes for the Steelers and Giants. That\u2019s enough to secure a No. 4 job, with a chance to compete at No. 3. Davon House (28), PackersAfter watching almost every snap of his seven-year career on film, it\u2019s still hard to declare whether he\u2019s good or bad. T.J. Carrie (27), RaidersHis experience in the slot and as a punt returner will bolster his value as a backup. Brent Grimes (34), BucsMany of us thought he would wash up a few years ago, but then he went to Tampa Bay and prospered. So we say, with a sprinkle of caution: He showed signs of decline last season. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Brandon Carr (Ravens), Marcus Cooper (Bears), William Gay (Steelers), Adam Jones (Bengals), Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (Giants), Sean Smith (Raiders), Aqib Talib (Broncos)SAFETIES DIFFERENCE MAKERS Eric Reid (26), 49ersTeams would be foolish to pass on him because of the anthem protests. He\u2019s a playmaker and one of the better multi-tool defenders in football, with significant experience at both safety spots, in the slot and at linebacker. Lamarcus Joyner (27), RamsA rangy centerfielder who can cover certain slot receivers in base defense; he\u2019s undersized, but he\u2019s also one of football\u2019s nastiest hitters. Morgan Burnett (29), PackersHe started 102 games in Green Bay, so the perception is that he\u2019s old. But 29 is middle-age for a smart safety. Adding to his value is that he\u2019s proven to be every bit as versatile as Eric Reid. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Kenny Vaccaro (27), SaintsHe never quite developed the cover skills to fulfill his first-round billing with the Saints, but teams that want to play with three safeties on first and second down will be very interested. Tavon Wilson (28), LionsHe\u2019s at his best in the box, particularly when rotating down into it after the snap. Kurt Coleman (29)\u2014Signed With Saints (three years, $18 million)An aggressive zone defender who has a knack for disguising his coverage. Corey Graham (32), EaglesThe former corner\u2019s coverage versatility was critical for Philly. Teams with expansive schemes should look closely at the veteran. T.J. Ward (31), BucsHe disappointed last season in Tampa Bay\u2019s zone-based scheme. At 31, can he still cover tight ends man-to-man? How teams answer that question will determine his fate in free agency. Tre Boston (25), ChargersHe\u2019s not particularly strong or physical, but he\u2019s become a reliable enough centerfielder, assuming he\u2019s playing with good cornerbacks. Bradley McDougald (27), SeahawksHe held up decently in the Kam Chancellor role with Seattle, and could very well be signed as a backup and wind up winning a starting job.

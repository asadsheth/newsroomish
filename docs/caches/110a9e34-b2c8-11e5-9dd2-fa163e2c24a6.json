The famous actor blasted the NFL in a tweet Tuesday morning, six days after the league approved a new national anthem policy that essentially denies its players' right to publicly protest before games. Carrey also took aim at President Donald Trump and suggested corporations who sponsor the NFL reconsider their partnerships. \u201cNFL \u2014 who exploits players for 3yrs then abandons them to a lifetime of pain \u2014 sided with a draft-dodging racist who uses fake patriotism to squash peaceful protest,\u201d Carrey wrote. \u201cCorporations (should) rethink sponsoring moral cowardice before we start asking:","published_at":1527619495,"content_id":"cf64f844-9612-3683-b770-99000c0bd9fd","content_url":"https:\/\/nesn.com\/2018\/05\/jim-carrey-calls-out-donald-trump-rails-against-nfl-in-fiery-tweet\/","content_published_at":1527618971,"content_time":1527618971,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-c7522c90-3dd1-3eb0-afb6-3a0f6bfb2f30_a-dc0a1c7a-563b-3bf2-81cc-da7bdd0351e4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/biggest-32-nfl-teams-elis-64mmq02","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"CBS Sports","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cbssports.com\/nfl\/news\/the-biggest-question-for-all-32-nfl-teams-from-elis-future-to-the-brady-belichick-feud\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5ZXbA6hUxXgez5WR7W15AQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JrqnvHfjKf3HXJJpkkzQwg--\/dz03NzA7aD00MzM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dc0a1c7a-563b-3bf2-81cc-da7bdd0351e4-1948806765.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qGI98o7n2PUkyD2Ay1kFTQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzM7dz03NzA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JrqnvHfjKf3HXJJpkkzQwg--\/dz03NzA7aD00MzM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dc0a1c7a-563b-3bf2-81cc-da7bdd0351e4-1948806765.jpeg","height":433,"width":770,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JrqnvHfjKf3HXJJpkkzQwg--\/dz03NzA7aD00MzM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dc0a1c7a-563b-3bf2-81cc-da7bdd0351e4-1948806765.jpeg","imgw":770,"imgh":433,"title":"The biggest question for all 32 NFL teams: From Eli's future to the Brady-Belichick feud","summary":"NFL teams think they found some of the answers to their problems in free agency and the draft.

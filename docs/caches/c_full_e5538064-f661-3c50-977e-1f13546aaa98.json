Previously this year, air pollution levels in London were worse than those in Beijing for a brief period - with the UK capital's pollutants frequently breaking UK limits.\u00a0 Pollution is a greater global threat than disease such as Ebola and HIV, according to warnings by the World Health Organisation. The WHO has outlined that one in four deaths among children aged under five are now due to environmental hazards such as air pollution and contaminated water. But how bad is air pollution in other areas of the UK? Search for your postcode to see how bad air pollution is in your area How high is air pollution in your area? How does the UK compare to the world? According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), London is just a mid-table city when it comes to the international league table of polluted places. London only ranked 1,389th out of the nearly \u00a03,000 cities and towns around the world monitored in the WHO's database of annual air pollution readings. Which cities have the worst air pollution levels? WHO guidelines state that cities should aim to have an annual average of no more than 10 micrograms of PM2.5 (very fine particulate matter) for every cubic metre of air. London had an annual PM2.5 average of 15 \u03bcg\/m3\u00a0in 2013, far lower than Beijing's average of 85.2\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3. These particles are very small in diameter and are classed as carcinogenic by leading health organisations. Thousands of deaths a year are attributable to air pollution in the UK. Which cities\u00a0have the highest air pollution levels worldwide? According to the WHO,\u00a0the most polluted city in the world is\u00a0Zabol in Iran. Zabol's PM2.5 measurements were found to average a massive\u00a0217\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3\u00a0for the latest available year - more than 20 times higher than the recommended level. The next two entries on the list are both located in India (Gwalior and\u00a0Allahabad) while the first non-Asian city on the list is\u00a0Bamenda in Cameroon which came in eighth place. \u00a0Tetovo in\u00a0Macedonia was the most polluted European city in the database, followed by\u00a0Tuzla in\u00a0 Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most polluted city in the UK isn't actually London. Glasgow topped that list, followed by Scunthorpe and Leeds with London in sixth place. However, given that these rankings are based on figures taken in 2013, the situation may have changed since. London may also experience greater peaks in air pollution but these figures are all annual averages. The 100 most air polluted cities in the world (PM2.5 \u03bcg\/m3) Asian cities tend to be more polluted The WHO's database is by no means a comprehensive list of every city in the world - many places will simply not be able to provide air pollution figures of sufficient quality to be included. However, from the figures available, Asian cities were the likeliest to exceed the 10\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3\u00a0guideline for\u00a0PM2.5. Just four of the 632 Asian locations included in the data were found to be below this level, meaning that the equivalent of 99.4 per cent of Asian cities exceeded it.

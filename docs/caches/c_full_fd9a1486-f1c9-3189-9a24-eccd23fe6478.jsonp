The game was previously advertised as a Windows Store exclusive, fitting considering that it's part of Xbox's Xbox One Play Anywhere titles, but that exclusivity may not be entirely true. As part of the Xbox One Play Anywhere program, State of Decay 2 would be able to be played on both the Xbox One and the PC without having to worry about starting over on either version, as your progress would be carried over between the two. The previous State of Decay game came out on Steam originally alongside the Xbox 360 version, so Undead Labs might be going for a sense of continuity with the prospect of State of Decay 2, if we're actually getting it.","published_at":1523910614,"content_id":"d812ee37-67fb-353f-8cea-57b1245bc322","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/04\/17\/we-may-be-seeing-state-of-decay-2-on-steam-possibly-not-windows-store-exclusive\/","content_published_at":1523910029,"content_time":1523910029,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":19,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"54a0e4d3-8fd6-3334-8266-2471d12f6452","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-712984d9-b647-360d-82a1-28267d155f36_a-54a0e4d3-8fd6-3334-8266-2471d12f6452","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-712984d9-b647-360d-82a1-28267d155f36_a-54a0e4d3-8fd6-3334-8266-2471d12f6452","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/want-excited-destiny-2s-warmind-3hgsw7x","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidthier\/2018\/04\/16\/i-want-to-be-excited-about-destiny-2s-warmind-dlc-but-im-struggling\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7DWlbNYlgFHJXrpJlP_lkg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fNEUZMwPIXfo9pdHrYcDTA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_54a0e4d3-8fd6-3334-8266-2471d12f6452-270891964.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HoPd31cLC7wEKU9ZlwjyVw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fNEUZMwPIXfo9pdHrYcDTA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_54a0e4d3-8fd6-3334-8266-2471d12f6452-270891964.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fNEUZMwPIXfo9pdHrYcDTA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_54a0e4d3-8fd6-3334-8266-2471d12f6452-270891964.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"I Want To Be Excited About Destiny 2's 'Warmind' DLC, But I'm Struggling","summary":"For a good two years or so, Destiny was a big part of my life.

Also available are the adventure game Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Game Series, the nostalgia-heavy RPG Kingsway, and Tokyo 42, a stealth-action game set in futuristic Japan. Last but not least is DubWars, which pairs Dubstep electronic music with top-down shooting.

As many fans will already know, a new Pokemon RPG is in the works and is coming to the Nintendo Switch soon. While still without a release date, recent reports indicate that players could still see something arrive in 2018. And with it being the first mainline Pokemon game on a Nintendo home console, expectations are high. There are rumoured to be some changes cooked up for the next adventure, which could also introduce a new generation of Pokemon. Changes to the battle system could be on the way, although none of this has been officially confirmed.","published_at":1523831841,"content_id":"94c55ab3-a80a-3719-b73d-d15847cfd0ec","content_url":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/entertainment\/gaming\/946268\/Nintendo-Switch-games-SHOCK-Pokemon-update-news","content_published_at":1523784600,"content_time":1523784600,"content_relative_time":54,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":54,"comment_relative_time":54,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ab2a50db-ca0b-344e-840c-406ddbbe70a4","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-0d7d76f3-0a68-3180-8bc5-58eb5da158df_a-ab2a50db-ca0b-344e-840c-406ddbbe70a4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-0d7d76f3-0a68-3180-8bc5-58eb5da158df_a-ab2a50db-ca0b-344e-840c-406ddbbe70a4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/chris-heckers-spyparty-gets-started-4c5o8r8","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"VentureBeat","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/04\/14\/chris-heckers-spyparty-gets-started-after-8-years-in-development\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vrDSwnGKVQ3Eb4JZPgZTxg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tG7Wsbc7y9y1Be6hi4.Hqg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NTg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ab2a50db-ca0b-344e-840c-406ddbbe70a4-1427009950.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dtCceCUce2HG084J2myb_Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01ODg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tG7Wsbc7y9y1Be6hi4.Hqg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NTg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ab2a50db-ca0b-344e-840c-406ddbbe70a4-1427009950.jpeg","height":588,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tG7Wsbc7y9y1Be6hi4.Hqg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NTg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ab2a50db-ca0b-344e-840c-406ddbbe70a4-1427009950.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":588,"title":"Chris Hecker's SpyParty gets started after 8 years in development","summary":"Most games don't take eight years to make.

The game launched on Thursday on Steam Early Access with all new art, 21 new animated characters, 10 art venues, and eight missions with a lot of variations. I played it with GamesBeat's Stephanie Chan yesterday and we took turns playing the spy, who plays a game of deception, and the sniper, who has to tap the power of perception.

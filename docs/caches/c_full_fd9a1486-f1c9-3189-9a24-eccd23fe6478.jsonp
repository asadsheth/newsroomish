Considering that games these days demand beefy systems, Vampyr PC System Requirements are quite reasonable as the game requires a Core i3-2130 with 8GB of RAM and a GPU with 2 GB of VRAM such as GTX 660. However, these are the minimum system requirements. For the recommended system requirements, the game demands a Core i7-3930K, with 16 GB of RAM and a GPU with 4 GB of VRAM such as GTX 970.

According to VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb, Battlefield 5's story will follow the same pattern as Battlefield 1 with each chapter featuring a different character offering the opportunity to experience the war from many different angles.

You can stand in place and move around a few feet but you're still tethered to a computer and not able to walk too far. Overall, I was impressed by the quality of the competitive games they've built for it. The company also demoed a next-generation system unlike anything I've experienced before.

The shooting from cover, regenerating health, or stamina systems are good examples. Some games step beyond that and define an entire market, with competitors jumping onboard to get their own piece of the pie. Here, you'll find games like World of Warcraft, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Hearthstone, Assassin's Creed, and Dark Souls. Success breed imitation. Sometimes though, a great style of gameplay doesn't find itself being copied endlessly. Sometimes a mechanic stays within its own lane.

The popularity of Fortnite may be precisely why the creators of PUBG are working hard on a new, smaller island map for their own PC-focused game, which will debut on its test servers next month.","published_at":1520614091,"content_id":"d0b2d423-9f8a-38c4-89c8-96193131a3a3","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/3\/9\/17100424\/pubg-new-island-map-smaller-fortnite-battle-royale-popular-response","content_published_at":1520571600,"content_time":1520571600,"content_relative_time":87,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":87,"comment_relative_time":87,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"75b7aaa3-646f-3c69-a558-82b38219f2cc","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-2848940c-d29b-375f-a41a-8e6d3fcd2519_a-75b7aaa3-646f-3c69-a558-82b38219f2cc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-2848940c-d29b-375f-a41a-8e6d3fcd2519_a-75b7aaa3-646f-3c69-a558-82b38219f2cc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/video-game-review-nintendos-bayonetta-b12pp1z","author":"third_watch","provider":"DeseretNews.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.deseretnews.com\/article\/900012412\/Video-game-review-Nintendos-Bayonetta-games-are-slick-stylish-and-mature.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/00VmnQCO9vqxI8AuE5kggg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KEIiWHK9vJ.Cis46MQTieg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_75b7aaa3-646f-3c69-a558-82b38219f2cc--1122234455.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LGcAFdAfqXQgCXXAgtOUhA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KEIiWHK9vJ.Cis46MQTieg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_75b7aaa3-646f-3c69-a558-82b38219f2cc--1122234455.jpeg","height":675,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KEIiWHK9vJ.Cis46MQTieg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_75b7aaa3-646f-3c69-a558-82b38219f2cc--1122234455.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":675,"title":"Video game review: Nintendo's 'Bayonetta' games are slick, stylish and mature","summary":"SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 While Nintendo generally deals in family-friendly fare, they've occasionally tried to publish titles intended solely for their adult audience. \u201cBayonetta 2,\u201d the most recent port from the Wii U, and its predecessor, \"Bayonetta\" fit nicely into this category.

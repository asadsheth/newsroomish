Most board games are not \u201cpro-colonialist,\u201d of course, but simulating a long history of European imperialism necessarily means that a lot of us sit around on game nights trying to figure out the most efficient way to exploit the resources (and sometimes, uncomfortably, the people) of a newly \u201cdiscovered\u201d land. Spirit Island, a cooperative strategy game for one to four players, flips this well-worn script on its head. Instead of playing as settlers building out villages and roads in a new land, you and your friends take on the role of god-like elemental spirits charged with protecting the island's various landscapes from those pesky invaders, who are controlled by the game itself.","published_at":1521958582,"content_id":"714c77a6-c776-3cb8-badc-9fea5af6e5db","content_url":"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gaming\/2018\/03\/spirit-island-review-finally-an-anti-colonialist-board-game\/?comments=1&post=35037399&mode=quote","content_published_at":1521892800,"content_time":1521892800,"content_relative_time":58,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":58,"comment_relative_time":58,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6b6bebdd-e73d-324a-87e9-0e094f8ee921","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-62006737-380f-35ec-9635-dd317377b5ed_a-6b6bebdd-e73d-324a-87e9-0e094f8ee921","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-62006737-380f-35ec-9635-dd317377b5ed_a-6b6bebdd-e73d-324a-87e9-0e094f8ee921","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/resident-evil-code-veronica-part-2vn1ob8","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Gamespot Videos","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/resident-evil-code-veronica-part-010027824.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MNe42ndf_QsVdGot4BqUQQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.gamespotvideos.com\/16d021c43f2e3539e47b56b31fff96e4","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MNe42ndf_QsVdGot4BqUQQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.gamespotvideos.com\/16d021c43f2e3539e47b56b31fff96e4","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.gamespotvideos.com\/16d021c43f2e3539e47b56b31fff96e4","imgw":640,"imgh":360,"title":"Resident Evil Code: Veronica Part 2 -

And while developer PUBG Corp. has shown off some artwork previously that offered a sense for the map's layout, we've now gotten a peek at what it looks like in-game. Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene offered the glimpse during a panel at the Game Developers Conference. He subsequently shared it in the tweet you see below. It appears to have a more tropical setting than the existing maps, and it has some new types of buildings we haven't seen before. Most notably, Greene points out that this is a 4x4km map, which is markedly smaller than 8x8km size of Erangel and Miramar.

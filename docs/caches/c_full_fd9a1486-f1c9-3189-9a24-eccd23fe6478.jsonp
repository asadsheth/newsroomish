It's a puzzle game in which two friends journey to a series of surreal islands, solving puzzles in order to ascend each one. Players do not control the players themselves, only the timeline, which can be moved back and forth. This allows for a lot of fiddling around with lanterns, lights, bells and bridges. Really, it's an observation game, a kind of kinetic Where's Waldo?. It's a game of observation and logic. Things are constantly moving around, and must be organized just so, in order to progress. I played the game recently and enjoyed its pace and its aesthetic.

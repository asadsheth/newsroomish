It\u2019s the first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill in New York to make it past studies and commissions and into the hands of the legislative branch. Kim introduced the legislation on March 13, 2018, after he met with blockchain industry leaders on the subject.Known as The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act (A9899), the bill relates to \u201cthe audit of cryptocurrency business activity by third party depositories and prohibits licensing fees to conduct such cryptocurrency business activity.\u201dIf it were to take effect, the legislation would make amendments to Section 9 of New York\u2019s Banking Law. With the addition of section 9-x, the law would mandate that any cryptocurrency business or entity be subject to routine audits by a public or third-party depository service. These audits would require that individuals and businesses alike safeguard assets with proper security measures, provide adequate insurance for account holder assets and produce proof-of-asset ownership. Any entity in full compliance will receive a digital New York Seal of Approval to reassure consumers that the outlet is trustworthy and secure. This seal would ideally replace the BitLicenses currently issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services, doing away with this fee-based license in favor of one earned by audit. Kim believes that earlier efforts to regulate the space have put enormous burdens on businesses trying to grow and operate in the cryptocurrency space. \u201cWhat New York needs now,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201care common-sense laws and security procedures to provide a degree of clarity for both businesses and the public. This legislation will give consumers and companies the confidence needed for widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in New York.\u201dWhile the bill is the first of its kind for New York legislators, this isn\u2019t Kim\u2019s first foray into cryptocurrency. As a precursor to the landmark legislation, Kim recently published a brief report titled \u201cThe Future of Bitcoin in NY.\u201d His research identifies unregulated exchanges as \u201cthe weak point\u201d in the blockchain ecosystem. This vulnerability, coupled with the cost of a BitLicense, has left New York lacking in legitimate crypto-companies and consumer confidence.According to a statement from Kim\u2019s office, there are currently fewer than 10 BitLicense holders in the entire state of New York, even though there are some 1,000 active job postings in New York for the blockchain industry. It\u2019s Kim\u2019s hope that the new legislation will foster a friendlier environment for companies in the space; one that will attract more business and generate increased revenue by connecting consumers with reliable, state-vetted entities.Throughout 2017, the United States government remained relatively quiet on the subject of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. While other countries are beginning to outline clear regulations and legislative guidelines, U.S. investors have had their ears filled with conflicting talk from the SEC, the CFTC and various state legislatures. So far, however, it\u2019s been a busy year for the United State\u2019s regulatory efforts, both on federal and state levels, and The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act is yet another installment in a growing series of litigation that finally broaches the topic of cryptocurrency regulations. If anything, the legislation may set a precedent for consumer protections in the industry, as well as a more lenient regulatory approach that might encourage job growth in the industry.

The report further indicates that the use would be to develop and operate a cryptocurrency mining facility. \u201cPort Executive Director Patrick Reay said his agency has been working with Ant Creek LLC for about six months on the development of a blockchain facility.\u201d\u201cOur purpose is to generate assessed value and create jobs,\u201d Reay stated. The Ant Creek proposal looks to bring up to 20 jobs and $10 million in private investment to the city.Some areas are concerned about the power consumption of crypto mining, such as Plattsburgh, New York, where they are considering banning mining, while other areas such as Quebec, Canada, are welcoming it. Reay said the Port of Walla Walla doesn\u2019t share Plattsburgh\u2019s concern over electricity. \u201cThe Port of Walla Walla, as a municipal entity, is not in the electrical business, as we do not sell electrical service,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe have two electrical providers in Walla Walla County, Columbia REA and Pacific Power.\u201d This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine.","published_at":1520958398,"content_id":"8783de34-ca57-365e-afe9-46e4a430e610","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/bitmain-explores-more-sites-bitcoin-162638354.html","content_published_at":1520958398,"content_time":1520958398,"content_relative_time":54,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-6061cc41-b6af-356f-aaf1-bfc847600386_a-5a321ac6-06ae-38d7-9cda-c189e6db8b86","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-6061cc41-b6af-356f-aaf1-bfc847600386_a-5a321ac6-06ae-38d7-9cda-c189e6db8b86","author":"nanook","provider":"Investopedia","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/-\/what-bitcoin-gold-exactly\/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"What is Bitcoin Gold, Exactly?","summary":"Bitcoin gold is a hard fork of bitcoin that attempts to decentralize the mining process.","published_at":1520954533,"content_id":"5a321ac6-06ae-38d7-9cda-c189e6db8b86","content_url":"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/-\/what-bitcoin-gold-exactly\/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1520967360,"content_time":1520967360,"content_relative_time":51,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-0528ee0f-7e4b-3819-8053-02fa00976dec_a-73bcd3e9-b810-356a-bad1-3b8f28e6eb23","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-0528ee0f-7e4b-3819-8053-02fa00976dec_a-73bcd3e9-b810-356a-bad1-3b8f28e6eb23","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/bitcoin-price-risks-rising-goldman-sachs-2018-3","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BAeGiOXt_S9My5A0nTwi3Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.qbZpS5pZ9eqFyy3qgaS0g--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_73bcd3e9-b810-356a-bad1-3b8f28e6eb23-634473765.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0ucdiErxSn6H2HSQjtDvdg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.qbZpS5pZ9eqFyy3qgaS0g--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_73bcd3e9-b810-356a-bad1-3b8f28e6eb23-634473765.jpeg","height":375,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.qbZpS5pZ9eqFyy3qgaS0g--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_73bcd3e9-b810-356a-bad1-3b8f28e6eb23-634473765.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":375,"title":"GOLDMAN SACHS WARNS: Risks are rising that bitcoin will fall through its February lows","summary":"Bitcoin has broken support near $9,210.

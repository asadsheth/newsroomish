We were all mesmerised when the series came to children's TV channel Cartoon Network and a good part of our childhood was spent rooting for Goku and his friends. Now, it's here on mobile. There have been multiple Dragon Ball games on mobile but Dragon Ball Legends does justice to our expectations. To make it comfortable for mobile users, it is a vertical fighting game that can be played with just one hand. The fighting mechanics are a lot of fun. All the fights happen in the air and you can move around by swiping. You can also throw soft attacks by tapping. However, the main fighting lies in the action cards that you can use.

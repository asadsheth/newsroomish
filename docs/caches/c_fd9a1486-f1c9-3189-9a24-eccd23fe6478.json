The first Gundam: Battle Operation was released on the PS3 back in 2012 and did relatively well. This was mainly because the overheads for its development cost were very low, as the team ended up re-purposing Gundam Senki 0081 and most of its assets. However, Battle Operation added some on foot sections for pilots and some over the top wrestling type moves into the game. This new sequel will retain those elements but also include space-based missions (shown above).

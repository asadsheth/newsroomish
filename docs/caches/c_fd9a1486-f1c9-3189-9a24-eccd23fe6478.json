First was the Razer Blade Stealth ($1,449.99 at Amazon.com), an ultrathin laptop to compete with the MacBooks ($1,239.00 at Amazon.com) of the world. Now there's the Razer Cynosa Chroma. The Cynosa is technically a\u00a0gaming\u00a0keyboard, but its three best features have little to do with gaming: Spill resistance, how it looks and what it costs.\u00a0 The Cynosa retails for $59 in the US, AU$99 in Australia and \u00a364 in the UK, making it the cheapest Razer keyboard. There's also a Pro version, which lets you add lighting effects under the keyboard itself, for $79, AU$139 and \u00a379.\u00a0","published_at":1513518315,"content_id":"40b96c32-9b15-3c9e-a029-425b90155544","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/products\/razer-cynosa-chroma\/preview\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a3674e24b738500072114e2&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","content_published_at":1513512022,"content_time":1513512022,"content_relative_time":35,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":35,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b05b8765-d001-3771-b4ad-7a4dc9f8515f_a-c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b05b8765-d001-3771-b4ad-7a4dc9f8515f_a-c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/greatest-video-games-2017-46hr3xo","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"CNET","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/pictures\/here-are-the-greatest-video-games-of-2017\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a366dd93ed3f00007c65ef6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KXtws0UNGJqOadXSm4bDMA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H1xzpTFBYY3brLYw5hPs5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6--1271472524.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YAbZgP6loGDOglsIFW7N_A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H1xzpTFBYY3brLYw5hPs5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6--1271472524.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H1xzpTFBYY3brLYw5hPs5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6--1271472524.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Here are the greatest video games of 2017","summary":"CNET tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol.","published_at":1513516518,"content_id":"c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/pictures\/here-are-the-greatest-video-games-of-2017\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a366dd93ed3f00007c65ef6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","content_published_at":1513512000,"content_time":1513512000,"content_relative_time":35,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":35,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a0e032a4-24a9-3933-88fe-e9568c86c6ad","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-91043cf5-770a-39d7-bc86-b47532fc77c9_a-a0e032a4-24a9-3933-88fe-e9568c86c6ad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-91043cf5-770a-39d7-bc86-b47532fc77c9_a-a0e032a4-24a9-3933-88fe-e9568c86c6ad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/most-talked-video-games-play-2mh2swf","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Popular Mechanics","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/culture\/gaming\/g14444347\/new-video-game-releases\/?src=socialflowTW","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"The Most Talked-About Video Games to Play This Year","summary":"We've praised Destiny in the past because it's a game that offers something for everyone thanks to its massive open world, story-based campaigns, co-op mode, and, of course, online play.

The NPD tracks US video game sales, counting both digital and physical copies sold across most game publishers, giving us a pretty clear picture of how well the year's biggest games have performed\u2014though we sadly have little to no information about how much these games' budgets. In any case, now that we've seen November's numbers, we can safely say that\u00a0Call of Duty: WWII\u00a0is the best-selling game not only of the month but of the entire year.

Fortnite fans recently spotted a comet floating in the skies above Tilted Towers.\u00a0 This has led to speculation that Epic Games is getting ready to level the region in a bid to balance the game. One popular theory is that the comet will strike Tilted Towers at the end of season 3 on April 30. This is based on a morse code message linked to newly discovered controller rumblings. According to one\u00a0Reddit\u00a0user, the rumblings translate to \"SOS D 5 418\", which supports the Tilted Towers theory. Tilted Towers is located at D5 on the map, while 418 could be a reference to April 2018. The SOS, meanwhile, is pretty self-explanatory.","published_at":1524042793,"content_id":"c6e17928-f868-377b-9151-6ce8cd165710","content_url":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/entertainment\/gaming\/947761\/Fortnite-Tilted-Towers-meteor-strike-Epic-Battle-Royale-changes-update","content_published_at":1524057900,"content_time":1524057900,"content_relative_time":9,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video

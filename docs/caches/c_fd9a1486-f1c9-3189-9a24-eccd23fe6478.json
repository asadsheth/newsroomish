But not the ones in Sleep Tight. In this twin-stick shooter, you fight back against the bogeyman by building forts and arming yourself with an arsenal of toy weapons. It's developer We Are Fuzzy's debut game, and it launches July 26 on PC and Nintendo Switch. To fight off waves of nighttime monsters, players can choose from a roster of 12 kids, each of whom has their own special perk. For instance, Lynn sports a star-studded astronaut outfit. She just came back from space camp, and she researches new skills faster than others.

So when Kojima posts a picture of grass (or is it moss?) you best pay attention. Although maybe this time all Kojima really did tweet was a picture of moss rendered through the Decima engine. Decima is the game engine created by Guerrilla Games and currently used by Kojima Productions for its new game, Death Stranding. Admittedly the picture of the moss Kojima released really is an impressive graphical demonstration of what the team at Kojima Productions is doing with Guerrilla's engine.

According to the tweet, the update will roll out on Tuesday at 8AM ET, and there won't be any server downtime to keep you from jumping in. Epic has been teasing the inclusion of jetpacks for months, but after having to delay the feature back in February, the item will highlight the latest content update this week. Interestingly though, the New Updates splash screen in Fortnite reveals that the jetpacks will only be available for a limited time. Whether or not this is because the development team couldn't figure out a way to balance the item appropriately or just to test the water remains to be seen. Last week, Twitter account Fortnite: Battle Royale Leaks (@FNBRLeaks) shared screenshots from a datamine which suggested that jetpacks would appear alongside a limited-time mode called Close Encounters: Close Quarters Combat with Shotguns & Jetpacks! If you find a jetpack, double-tap the jump button to take off. Keep the button held down to apply thrust. Make sure to land before it runs out of fuel! The Close Encounters mode has yet to be confirmed, but we'll know tomorrow morning just how accurate the leak really was. In the meantime, it's hard not to get excited about jetpacks in Battle Royale. Sure, the item might end up being overpowered, but it will give players the ability to explore the map in a whole new way.","published_at":1526941833,"content_id":"bcb47143-2b7b-3bd8-9a50-96051a93ec56","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fortnite-finally-getting-jetpacks-tomorrow-content-222407506.html","content_published_at":1526941447,"content_time":1526941447,"content_relative_time":45,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":45,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"4bf27ffd-ac72-3a13-bee3-28c1fc78b8ad","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b14a0d5e-0ca2-3d98-b31f-f7cc9d2010c0_a-4bf27ffd-ac72-3a13-bee3-28c1fc78b8ad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b14a0d5e-0ca2-3d98-b31f-f7cc9d2010c0_a-4bf27ffd-ac72-3a13-bee3-28c1fc78b8ad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/red-dead-redemption-2-release-3258gsv","author":"third_watch","provider":"GameSpot","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/red-dead-redemption-2-release-info-john-marston-an\/1100-6458891\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E.LehQQSpUlvnO57bfCJhw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nNgs1e1GsRDHY9nnAotbfQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4bf27ffd-ac72-3a13-bee3-28c1fc78b8ad--618320885.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Od1ZfugRdkqEKlmE94uzEw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nNgs1e1GsRDHY9nnAotbfQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4bf27ffd-ac72-3a13-bee3-28c1fc78b8ad--618320885.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nNgs1e1GsRDHY9nnAotbfQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4bf27ffd-ac72-3a13-bee3-28c1fc78b8ad--618320885.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Red Dead Redemption 2: Release Info, John Marston, And Everything We Know So Far","summary":"Rockstar Games' follow-up to the seminal Red Dead Redemption is fast approaching.

Fans in attendance saw its debut via a video. You can hear their excitement build as they understand Valve is about to unveil its first new game since Dota 2 came out in 2013 (not counting The Lab, which was more of a VR experiment). Then you can hear that excitement fade when they learn that the new game, Artifact, is a digital card game based on Dota 2 that's coming out for PC later in 2018. Valve was once known for strong single-player experiences like Half-Life and Portal along with its multiplayer games.

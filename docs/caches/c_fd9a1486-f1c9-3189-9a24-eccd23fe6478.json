Fortnite fans recently spotted a comet floating in the skies above Tilted Towers.\u00a0 This has led to speculation that Epic Games is getting ready to level the region in a bid to balance the game. One popular theory is that the comet will strike Tilted Towers at the end of season 3 on April 30. This is based on a morse code message linked to newly discovered controller rumblings. According to one\u00a0Reddit\u00a0user, the rumblings translate to \"SOS D 5 418\", which supports the Tilted Towers theory. Tilted Towers is located at D5 on the map, while 418 could be a reference to April 2018. The SOS, meanwhile, is pretty self-explanatory.","published_at":1524042793,"content_id":"c6e17928-f868-377b-9151-6ce8cd165710","content_url":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/entertainment\/gaming\/947761\/Fortnite-Tilted-Towers-meteor-strike-Epic-Battle-Royale-changes-update","content_published_at":1524057900,"content_time":1524057900,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":6,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d609d635-3513-3d4d-b5f3-7a0cd13be64b_a-a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d609d635-3513-3d4d-b5f3-7a0cd13be64b_a-a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d609d635-3513-3d4d-b5f3-7a0cd13be64b_a-a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Telegraph","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-11-25\/6444b400-b2f3-11e6-8ae7-f78be97b10cf_app_icon_square_128px.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.style.yahoo.com\/spider-man-ps4-hands-preview-070200703.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AUerkWJKWIRMAAoKN49SIQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/211f40464e4f355931eb0cb7cdeaf4eb","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ail_sso.poPpfwltpgtkVw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xOTU5O3c9MzEzNDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/211f40464e4f355931eb0cb7cdeaf4eb","height":1959,"width":3134,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/211f40464e4f355931eb0cb7cdeaf4eb","imgw":3134,"imgh":1959,"title":"Spider-Man PS4 hands-on preview | Sensational swinging has Insomniac aiming for amazing","summary":"Spider-Man PS4 hands-on preview | Sensational swinging has Insomniac aiming for amazing","published_at":1524034920,"content_id":"a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.style.yahoo.com\/spider-man-ps4-hands-preview-070200703.html","content_published_at":1524062282,"content_time":1524062282,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":5,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"37fbcd70-3f9d-30d4-ac85-8239ccba4f2a","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-f1e67b4e-290e-356f-b09b-0609803a76a4_a-37fbcd70-3f9d-30d4-ac85-8239ccba4f2a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-f1e67b4e-290e-356f-b09b-0609803a76a4_a-37fbcd70-3f9d-30d4-ac85-8239ccba4f2a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/star-wars-battlefront-2-1-4w05gdl","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Newsweek","provider_url":"http:\/\/europe.newsweek.com","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-12-05\/92ab3d90-bae2-11e6-9da6-3b7a932389dd_NEWSWEEK_64X64-1-.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/star-wars-battlefront-2-1-105046028.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hQanmpvTqFyUPVKqInO8JQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/dbc89b6935de2830621b717495774425","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ib46ccZ9dyaA4qNkx3bslQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzg7dz02NzI7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/dbc89b6935de2830621b717495774425","height":378,"width":672,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/dbc89b6935de2830621b717495774425","imgw":672,"imgh":378,"title":"\u2018Star Wars Battlefront 2 1.10 Update Live With Skins & Ewoks - Patch Notes","summary":"Star Wars Battlefront 2 update 1.10 has just deployed, and it introduces skins and playable Ewoks to the game in a 4GB download.

While Perfect Dark has not been confirmed but, Forza Horizon 4 announcement has been confirmed to E3 2018.","published_at":1523972089,"content_id":"f03f7ae4-2d65-3680-a43c-537521c78e0c","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/04\/17\/rare-hints-perfect-dark-reveal-e3-2018\/","content_published_at":1523971854,"content_time":1523971854,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-db61ba63-045a-339b-92b5-e50fef3b6818_a-33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-db61ba63-045a-339b-92b5-e50fef3b6818_a-33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/yakuza-6-now-play-entire-553c921","author":"third_watch","provider":"GameSpot","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/videos\/yakuza-6-is-out-now-but-you-should-play-the-entire\/2300-6443574\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.ekMgrfCyh9OxNBmbqLFQg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iQUciCYRH4XvEKFUQe.qJQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673--1271622497.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JMhRKWy3NWpwJtuuvWv2xw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iQUciCYRH4XvEKFUQe.qJQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673--1271622497.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iQUciCYRH4XvEKFUQe.qJQ--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673--1271622497.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Yakuza 6 Is Out Now, But You Should Play The Entire Series","summary":"With the launch of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life for PS4, Michael, Ben, and Jean-Luc talk about what makes Yakuza so great and why you need to play this underrated series. With the final chapter closing on the story of our beloved friend Kazuma Kiryu in Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life for PlayStation 4, we realized that the long-running series deserves to be experienced by a wider audience. In the West, it all began in 2006 with the release of the first Yakuza on PlayStation 2, but over the course of seven games in the span of 12 years, we saw our favorite characters grow and overcome the hardest of times. The Yakuza series perfectly captures an unlikely balance of absurdity and melodrama that has brought a few tears to our eyes, either from laughing uncontrollably or lamenting the death of an important character.","published_at":1523995263,"content_id":"33b58002-3343-31ce-a383-fbd598a6a673","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/videos\/yakuza-6-is-out-now-but-you-should-play-the-entire\/2300-6443574\/","content_published_at":1523969460,"content_time":1523969460,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-38d8167c-e441-3c79-b0a5-b67fada7bf19_a-cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-38d8167c-e441-3c79-b0a5-b67fada7bf19_a-cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/war-mode-replaces-world-pvp-4jw9xjd","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Polygon","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2018\/4\/17\/17218594\/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-war-mode-world-pvp","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E3ibjgExOr8LDrW9C7t5Qg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uIf1pDTBYwAybb_mKesvfQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09--1663132981.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YiYNiQ3Gmae94C1rIPeOvw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uIf1pDTBYwAybb_mKesvfQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09--1663132981.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uIf1pDTBYwAybb_mKesvfQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09--1663132981.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"'War Mode' replaces world PvP in World of Warcraft's next expansion","summary":"At BlizzCon 2017, alongside the announcement of the Battle for Azeroth expansion, Blizzard announced that PvP servers would be going away in World of Warcraft. Thanks to a Q&A with game director Ian Hazzikostas at Blizzard's headquarters, we now have a better idea of how the new world PvP system will work. If you're unfamiliar with the term, world PvP refers to players attacking and killing other players in the open world rather than designated arenas and battlegrounds. In the past, World of Warcraft's servers have either had world PvP turned on or world PvP turned off.

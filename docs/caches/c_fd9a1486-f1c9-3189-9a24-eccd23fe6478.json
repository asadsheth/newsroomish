Video games, not assault weapons, were to blame, the White House argued, and it met with representatives from the gaming industry last week to talk about that. Trump began the meeting with an ultra-violent montage of some gruesome video game scenes to hammer home his point: you can watch below, but be warned that it's specifically made to be disturbing.

For that reason the developers Bluehole decided to roll back the update, in order to fix those issues. The latest PUBG Update that rolled out for PC is now back in the hands of developers until they can figure out the issues that are causing the players to experience crashing and errors messages in the game. Although it is nice to have the anti-cheat system in the game, it's not worth anything if the game won't be working properly especially for those honest players.","published_at":1520845001,"content_id":"930497d9-5d38-305d-a8c8-4c5614174326","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/12\/pubg-update-rolled-back-due-compatibility-issue-players-experiencing-game-crashes\/","content_published_at":1520843398,"content_time":1520843398,"content_relative_time":33,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":33,"comment_relative_time":33,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d871ab85-12d6-39d3-a74c-4fb5dbdbe768","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-25e593fa-202c-3965-92ea-cca2204a2860_a-d871ab85-12d6-39d3-a74c-4fb5dbdbe768","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-25e593fa-202c-3965-92ea-cca2204a2860_a-d871ab85-12d6-39d3-a74c-4fb5dbdbe768","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/video-games-fuelling-rise-far-4stmgmr","author":"nanook","provider":"the Guardian","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2018\/mar\/12\/video-games-fuel-rise-far-right-violent-misogynist","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/P2tuORRcxwXcN1PnuF42JQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wHk9ongRC3hE9Q.buflhyQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d871ab85-12d6-39d3-a74c-4fb5dbdbe768--1023526987.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yDjZ9mPdsDGFBFwKiw938g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wHk9ongRC3hE9Q.buflhyQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d871ab85-12d6-39d3-a74c-4fb5dbdbe768--1023526987.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wHk9ongRC3hE9Q.buflhyQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d871ab85-12d6-39d3-a74c-4fb5dbdbe768--1023526987.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"How video games are fuelling the rise of the far right","summary":"Donald Trump's claim, in the aftermath of the Florida school shooting, that these events are the result of violent video games, resurrects old arguments about whether young people emulate the games they play.

With its latest entry, Far Cry 5, set to release soon, we decided to look back at the franchise and how it got to where it is today. In the video above, we run through the complete history of Far Cry. We start with the original, open-ended game from Crytek, the studio that would later go on to make the Crysis series. We look at the transition as Ubisoft Montreal took the reigns with the stellar Far Cry 2 and its many follow-ups--there have been quite a few Far Cry games, despite the fact that we're technically only up to Far Cry 5.

This time you won't be experiencing World War 2 the same way, as Battlefield 5 will put you in the shoes of the German side in its story, maybe not entirely but for a big amount of the campaign. According to VentureBeat's Jeff Grubb, Battlefield 5's story will follow the same pattern as Battlefield 1 with each chapter featuring a different character offering the opportunity to experience the war from many different angles. This means multiple stories and plenty of gameplay variety, just like any fan would want from his single player content.","published_at":1520772717,"content_id":"aae14768-f0e3-3785-ba7f-22b58c38c7fd","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/07\/leak-battlefield-5-story-will-follow-the-german-side-of-ww2\/","content_published_at":1520368105,"content_time":1520368105,"content_relative_time":165,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":165,"comment_relative_time":165,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c06fde89-18cf-34b5-8eef-5748330dd0b4_a-40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c06fde89-18cf-34b5-8eef-5748330dd0b4_a-40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c06fde89-18cf-34b5-8eef-5748330dd0b4_a-40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"VentureBeat","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/03\/07\/monetizr-brings-cryptocurrency-payments-to-mobile-games-for-virtual-and-physical-goods\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JPPPFG5.DdbdvIQiRPANqA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xfPGQZKhql9C4Z6qX7.eDg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215--1183430031.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GAKhl5RYzp38C1eV1gByjg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04NTA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xfPGQZKhql9C4Z6qX7.eDg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215--1183430031.jpeg","height":850,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xfPGQZKhql9C4Z6qX7.eDg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_40adf79c-efb9-35f8-8cf2-a3f0e1c18215--1183430031.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":850,"title":"Monetizr brings cryptocurrency payments to mobile games for virtual and physical goods","summary":"With the launch of Coinbase Commerce, vendors now have additional options when it comes to monetizing their apps and games.

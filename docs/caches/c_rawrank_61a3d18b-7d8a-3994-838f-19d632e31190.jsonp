Dave Grohl pulled a fan\u2014who he lovingly dubbed \u201cKiss Guy\u201d\u2014onstage to help the band perform \u201cMonkey Wrench,\u201d and he was not only surprised to find the guy brought his own pick but was also seriously impressed by this anonymous rocker's skills. Kiss Guy literally rocked his face off. Nailed it. Kinda hard not to smile after seeing how blown away Grohl was, from forgetting lyrics to bowing down to Kiss Guy.

is about to outgrow him. The films started\u00a0with a story about a team of L.A. street racers and has since evolved into a globe-trotting action spectacular with the same team (plus or minus a few members) taking on mercenaries, hackers, and terrorists. The franchise has become so successful it has even launched a spin-off for two of its characters: Luke Hobbs played by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham. And with the announcement that David Leith is directing the\u00a0spin-off film, rumored to be titled\u00a0Hobbs and Shaw, the stakes have been raised, and Diesel may","published_at":1524133978,"content_id":"065eb14c-44bd-3593-a39e-68cc030c3083","content_url":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/rock-statham-shaw-hobbs-fast-furious-future\/","content_published_at":1524052815,"content_time":1524052815,"content_relative_time":35,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Media watch","vibe_id":"61a3d18b-7d8a-3994-838f-19d632e31190","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":35,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"76a2ecd9-8ccd-36b5-8512-97b1b05c413f","post_id":"v-61a3d18b-7d8a-3994-838f-19d632e31190_c-9a9bcc9d-ae49-30a0-9729-7b56e6fc691d_a-76a2ecd9-8ccd-36b5-8512-97b1b05c413f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-61a3d18b-7d8a-3994-838f-19d632e31190_c-9a9bcc9d-ae49-30a0-9729-7b56e6fc691d_a-76a2ecd9-8ccd-36b5-8512-97b1b05c413f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/media-watch\/star-wars-15-memes-show-68p8yei","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Screen Rant","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/star-wars-phantom-menace-memes\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Star Wars: 15 Memes That Show The Phantom Menace Actually Makes Too Much Sense","summary":"For years, The Phantom Menace was\u00a0dissed by a great many Star Wars fans. It was held up as the worst of this sci-fi series, and fans picked apart everything from the silly characters to the abundant CGI. However, this movie and the rest of the prequels have gathered a renewed popularity in recent years, especially with hot subreddits showing us how funny these movies can be. There's more to The Phantom Menace than a chance for easy laughs, though. The movie and its characters actually have a lot of hidden depth, and time has revealed what a great debt later Star Wars mythology owes to the foundation established by this film. Skeptical? We don't blame you.

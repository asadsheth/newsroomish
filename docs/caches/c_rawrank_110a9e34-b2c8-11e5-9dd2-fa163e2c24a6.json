Pro athletes are overpaid.\u00a0 In the context of what they contribute to society compared to teachers, police officers, firemen and the like, who's going to argue? Yet who should complain given the perspective of professional sports market forces that easily support nine-figure, multi-year contracts?

The Seahawks contacted Kaepernick approximately two weeks ago to arrange a visit before the plans were altered unexpectedly due to his anthem stance, Schefter reported, citing a source. Per Schefter, Kaepernick was unwilling to say that he would alter his anthem stance that began in 2016 as a means to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The workout had been scheduled for Monday, according to Pro Football Talk, which added that it was only when the workout date approached that the Seahawks contacted Kaepernick to request that he commit to standing for the anthem.","published_at":1523564279,"content_id":"34486024-381b-3ffd-a1fb-8d5610704786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Sports_News\/NFL\/2018\/04\/12\/Report-Kaepernicks-visit-with-Seahawks-postponed\/9201523560112\/","content_published_at":1523560283,"content_time":1523560283,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/nfl\/2018\/04\/12\/nfl-rejects-burficts-appeal-upholds-4-game-suspension\/33779589\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wQL4qwuR4c9Z.T75GmYXAA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NvNLBQ0ujLv8d2HaTvj9_g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"NFL rejects Burfict's appeal, upholds 4-game suspension","summary":"CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict will be sidelined to start a season for the fourth year in a row, this time serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancers. The NFL rejected Burfict's appeal without comment and upheld the full suspension on Thursday. It's the third time the volatile linebacker has been suspended by the league in the past three years. The Bengals are accustomed to going without their most valuable defensive player, whom they've steadfastly supported throughout his suspension-shortened career. They even gave him a three-year contract extension last season while he was serving a three-game suspension from the league.

It's possible that they have been offered a better job elsewhere, or they are being offered less money to renew their current deal. Interpersonal issues can also be a major factor, as dislike between actors or the crew can grow to be toxic enough to make people want to quit.

Seacrest claimed his usual spot at the top of the carpet, with Rancic standing about 60 feet behind him, a less ideal spot for wrangling celebrities.

Here we hear about his early years in Wales with his clergyman grandfather who gave him \u201cthe sense that the world was full of stories\u201d. We also hear about Pullman\u2019s time as a teacher, which was when he honed his craft by teaching his pupils Greek mythology. His atheism is touched on \u2013 \u201chuman beings themselves are quite sufficient to explain both good and evil\u201d \u2013 although sensibly not allowed to overwhelm the film. Instead, Pullman discusses the influence of John Milton on his writing before coming down on the side of another great visionary: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the writer I am without William Blake,\u201d he says with a smile.\u00a0This is an altogether magical documentary. SH Classic Mary Berry BBC One, 8.30pm The unflappable Mary Berry heads to London to visit a school with a secret garden. There, the pupils grow vegetables and look after chickens. She also supervises a keen pair of Year 5 pupils as they prepare school lunch. SH Collateral BBC Two, 9.00pm David Hare\u2019s compelling yet infuriating drama reaches its conclusion as DI Kip Glaspie (Carey Mulligan) pulls it all together, even as army captain Sandrine (Jeany Spark) faces her demons. Meanwhile, John Simm\u2019s MP has a clunky confrontation with his party leader and a rather better one with his ex-wife (Billie Piper). SH Marcella ITV, 9.00pm Things get even murkier this week as Jason (Nicholas Pinnock) gives ex-wife Marcella (Anna Friel) some unwanted news, which causes her to struggle both at work and at home. Thank goodness then for DC LeAnn Hunter (Sophia Brown), who injects some welcome common sense into proceedings. SH Electric Dreams: Autofac Channel 4, 10.00pm This week\u2019s instalment of the sci-fi anthology follows Juno Temple\u2019s idealistic computer hacker working in a collapsing AI-dominated world. When she comes into conflict with a PR robot named Alice (an excellent Janelle Mon\u00e1e), there\u2019s revolution in the air. SH This Country BBC Three\/BBC iPlayer, from 10.00am The countryside comedy goes from strength to strength with an entertaining second episode that sees Kurtan (Charlie Cooper) indoctrinated into the secret ways of labouring by Kerry\u2019s (Daisy May Cooper) dad. The first episode is on BBC One tomorrow at 10.45pm. SH Active Shooter: America Under Fire Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm This series on mass shootings in the US comes to an end with an episode about the 1999 massacre at Columbine school in Colorado, which, following the shooting in Florida last month, no longer stands as the worst high-school shooting in US history. The matter is sensitively handled, as journalist Dave Cullen debunks the theory that the perpetrators were \u201cdepressed outcasts\u201d. But, most importantly, the focus is on the victims and survivors, such as the school\u2019s principal and Jefferson County\u2019s head investigator, who discuss how their lives have changed. SH Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Film4, 11.00am George Roy Hill directed two of the most popular films ever: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sting (1973). But this indifferent Julie Andrews musical of the flapper era came first. There\u2019s much to enjoy in the story of a naive woman who leaves her rural roots behind to seek fortune and romance in Twenties New York. James Fox, as a spiffing salesman,\u00a0is a particular highlight. Carol (2015) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Film4, 9.00pm Todd Haynes\u2019s adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s 1952 novel is gorgeous, gently groundbreaking, and quite possibly be the saddest thing that you\u2019ll ever see. It tells the story of a photographer (Rooney Mara) who has a relationship with an older woman (Cate Blanchett, with a subtlety that\u2019s little short of phenomenal) in New York. Haynes\u2019s film concludes that love is the riskiest but most necessary gamble in anyone\u2019s experience. Nacho Libre (2006) \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 ITV4, 12.05am There are some terrific sight gags in this silly comedy but one might have expected more from Jack Black (who was so good in School of Rock, Shallow Hal and High Fidelity) and the director of Napoleon Dynamite, Jared Hess. Black plays Ignacio, a friar in a Mexican orphanage who, to raise money, moonlights as a Mexican wrestler. He battles some tough opponents, but none as fierce as the monastery\u2019s opprobrium for the sport. Tuesday 6 March Bill, Harry, Martin and Roisin, with Sandi, Noel and Paul\u00a0 Credit: Channel 4 The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up to Cancer Channel 4, 8.00pm The baking competition returns with this largely comical charity version\u00a0of the show as 20 celebrities, including Griff Rhys Jones, Lee Mack and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, don their pinnies and tackle challenges designed for fun. \u201cWhen you can make and eat cake all for a good cause, it\u2019s a win\/win,\u201d says Desperate Housewives actress Teri Hatcher, a surprise American entrant who appears later in the five-part run. In this first episode, it\u2019s broadcaster Bill Turnbull, Spandau Ballet\u2019s Martin Kemp, actress Roisin Conaty and comedian Harry Hill who are the first to crack eggs. The technical challenge is Cr\u00eapes Suzette, while the Signature is to make 12 iced cupcakes. Hill, who lost his hair aged 23, decorates his in honour of the balding community. Judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith then set an entertaining, three-dimensional biscuit showstopper that is supposed to represent the best day of the contestants\u2019 lives. It\u2019s a good job that Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding are on hand to moderate the chaos. \u201cAbsolute carnage,\u201d says Conaty as she retrieves her ginger biscuits from the oven. VP Shetland BBC One, 9.00pm; Wales, 10.40pm This superior murder mystery series continues with Perez and Tosh (Douglas Henshall and Alison O\u2019Donnell) still on the hunt for prime suspect Mathias S\u00f8derland. But a nasty discovery brings their Norwegian adventure to an abrupt end. VP Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby BBC Two, 9.00pm Under the heading of \u201cnice work if you can get it\u201d, this series sees Monica Galetti and Giles Coren go behind the scenes of high-end hotels. Tonight they\u2019re at Oman\u2019s Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar, where Galetti talks to female staff pushing boundaries by working alongside men. VP Seven Year Switch Channel 4, 9.15pm The relationship experiment, a successor to Wife Swap, returns for a second series. Four warring couples suffering from the \u201cseven-year itch\u201d swap places for two weeks. Tonight\u2019s batch are sent to Thailand to see if the experience gives rise to self-reflection. VP Mum BBC Two, 10.00pm; N Ireland, 11.15pm Widow Cathy (Lesley Manville) is prevented from restarting her life by thoughtless family members in this bittersweet comedy. This episode\u2019s zinger is Pauline (Dorothy Atkinson) saying to Cathy: \u201cYou, having a barbecue? I bet that reminds you of your dead husband.\u201d VP Divorce Sky Atlantic, 10.10pm The second series of this black comedy starring Sarah Jessica Parker has found a lighter tone than the first, no doubt down to new showrunner Jenny Bicks, a Sex and the City veteran. Parker navigates between comedy and pathos skilfully as the newly divorced Frances, who tonight endures a betrayal by her best friend Dallas (Talia Balsam) and an embarrassing set-up by mate Diane (Molly Shannon). VP\u00a0 The War PBS America, 10.15pm Master storyteller Ken Burns, of The Civil War fame, explores the Second World War through a very American lens. This seven-part series, first shown in 2007 and airing nightly this week, features accounts of war from inhabitants from four US towns \u2013 Alabama, California, Connecticut and Minnesota \u2013 to paint a picture of the human cost of war. Tom Hanks and Samuel L Jackson, among others, provide the voice-overs. This opener starts with Pearl Harbor. VP\u00a0 Roman Holiday (1953, b\/w)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Sky Cinema Oscars, 2.30pm The film that made Audrey Hepburn a star has retained much of its innocent charm. She plays a princess on a visit to Rome, who escapes her guardians and takes off on a jaunt through the city with a journalist (Gregory Peck). He recognises her but isn\u2019t letting on because he\u2019s hoping for an exclusive. Shot on location, it was so evocative that they\u2019re still selling postcards of it in Rome. The Expendables (2010)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ITV2, 9.00pm Director Sylvester Stallone gathers together some of Hollywood\u2019s most shirt-splitting muscle \u2013 including himself, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li and Jason Statham, with cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger trading insults in a church \u2013 for an all-guns-blazing romp to remove the corrupt leader of a fictitious island. Nothing surprising happens, and it\u2019s awash with blood and gore. Entertaining, though. Seven Psychopaths (2012)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Film4, 11.40pm Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken star in Martin McDonagh\u2019s (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) brutal black comedy. Boozy writer Marty (Farrell) is struggling to find the plot for his screenplay, so friend Billy (Rockwell), a part-time dognapper, tries to help him out \u2013 inadvertently embroiling him in a world of gangster crime. Not as clever as McDonagh\u2019s best work, but it\u2019s entertaining. Wednesday 7 March Midwives Shantelle Smith, Emma Flett and Antoinette Connolly Credit: Channel 4 One Born Every Minute Channel 4, 9.00pm This superb, Bafta-winning fly-on-the-maternity-ward series has proved time and time again that there are very few things more emotion-wringing than new lives coming into the world. Shaking things up a bit for its 10th run, One Born Every Minute has moved to a brand new home at Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital, to share the highs and lows of life on one of the UK\u2019s busiest maternity units.\u00a0 This opening episode focuses largely on reluctant military wife Samantha and her husband Tony, who have struggled for years to conceive as a result of complications arising from her childhood leukaemia, only for them to lose their first child at 25 weeks. Now they\u2019re back in the hospital hoping to welcome a new baby into the world.\u00a0 But with Samantha\u2019s medical history, some complications are inevitable. Elsewhere on the ward are Rav and Sharon, who are expecting their second child together, and Rhiana and Lee, also expecting their second baby and hoping for a repeat of her textbook first water-birth. But, as this series has also shown repeatedly, when it comes to having a baby, it\u2019s best to be a little prepared for things not to go exactly according to plan. GO The World\u2019s Most Extraordinary Homes BBC Two, 8.00pm Switzerland is a great place to be an architect with \u201cvision\u201d as its citizens are among the world\u2019s wealthiest and its Alpine scenery makes for unparalleled settings. Here, Piers Taylor and Caroline Quentin explore four of its most splendidly contemporary homes. GO Earth\u2019s Natural Wonders BBC One, 9.00pm A return to the Mato Grosso in Brazil for the Kamayur\u00e1 people\u2019s ceremony to appease the Amazon gods, and to Ethiopia, where mothers risk life and limb in a cliff-climb to give their newborns the best start in life. GO The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story BBC Two, 9.00pm The drama series about the fashion designer\u2019s 1997 murder by serial killer Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss) certainly exerts a grip. Episode two explores how the Aids crisis played into the furore surrounding Versace\u2019s (Edgar Ram\u00edrez) death. GO Damned Channel 4, 10.00pm More fun with Elm Heath\u2019s social services department as rumours spread about boss Denise\u2019s (Georgie Glen) home life. And is it coincidence that\u00a0Rose\u2019s (Jo Brand) car is stolen just when Ingrid\u2019s (Morwenna Banks) troubled foster son pays a visit? GO 100 Women Sky News, 4.00pm On the eve of International Women\u2019s Day, Kay Burley hosts a special live studio debate with one hundred women, selected to be as representative as possible of all parts and walks of life in Britain, discussing equal opportunities, the pay gap, what it means to be a feminist in 2018 and whether equality exists in the UK today. GO Lucy Worsley\u2019s Fireworks for a Tudor Queen BBC Four, 9.00pm Historian Lucy Worsley and scientist Zoe Laughlin recreate one of the earliest fireworks displays held in Britain. The year was 1575 and the occasion the extravagant festivities laid on by suitor Robert Dudley to woo Queen Elizabeth I. Worsley scours the history books and travels to Italy while Laughlin goes even further afield to research making authentic Elizabethan-style rockets, firework fountains and even a flame-belching dragon for a memorial event held at Kenilworth Castle. GO A Cinderella Story (2004)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 5STAR, 7.05pm Mauled by critics, this high-school drama \u2013 a modern interpretation of the eponymous fairy tale \u2013 was a huge success, grossing over $70 million and generating three sequels. Hilary Duff is a simpering but likeable Californian Cinderella, while teenage heart-throb Chad Michael Murray plays Prince Charming. The two fall in love as a dropped mobile phone substitutes for the glass slipper. Falling Down (1993)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 ITV4, 9.00pm Michael Douglas stars in this biting Joel Schumacher film that qualifies as subversive in Hollywood terms. It\u2019s a sweltering morning in LA, and troubled divorcee William (Douglas) has an existential breakdown while stuck in a traffic jam leading to a self-styled vigilante prowl, which only an aged cop (Robert Duvall) can stop. This portrait of fractured white masculinity, lost and about to explode, has never been more relevant. Memento (2000)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC One, 11.45pm; Wales, 12.10am;\u00a0N Ireland, 12.40am Since receiving a blow to the head from the man who raped and murdered his wife, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) can\u2019t make long-term memories. Nonetheless, Shelby is determined to have his revenge and develops a system for cataloguing events using polaroids and tattoos as aides-memoires. This is a bracing, complex revenge tale told in reverse. Thursday 8 March Still Game Credit: BBC Still Game BBC One, 9.30pm; Wales, 10.00pm In Scotland, this sitcom about a couple of mouthy, hard-drinking and permanently a-little-down-on-their-luck Scottish pensioners is something of a national institution. It initially ran from 2002-2007, before a series of sell-out live performances saw it return to TV in 2016, gaining a prime BBC One slot in the process. So what should new fans expect? The short answer: if you like your sitcoms smart but traditional and admire the way in which Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys plays with the genre while remaining true to it, then you\u2019ll love Still Game. But if laugh tracks, broadly drawn characters, slapstick and jokes about the eating habits of the gentrified inhabitants of Glasgow\u2019s West End aren\u2019t your thing, then you\u2019re unlikely to be that amused.\u00a0 Yet there\u2019s no doubting that Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill, who both write the show and take the leading roles as elderly reprobates Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade, know their audience and comedy history. Still Game is lovingly crafted, with each character from nosy-parker Isa (Jane McCarry) to well-meaning barman Boabby (Gavin Mitchell) given their chance to shine. It\u2019s not for everyone but it\u2019s easy to see why those who love it do. SH Crufts 2018 Channel 4 and More4, from 3.00pm Alan Carr and Claire Balding host a light-hearted companion piece at 3.00pm on Channel 4 before live coverage of the dog competition gets under way at 6.30pm on More4, where Balding meets Supervet Noel Fitzpatrick and presenter Peter Purves. The action moves to Channel 4 at 8.00pm, for live judging of the Working and Pastoral groups. SH Not Going Out BBC One, 9.00pm Lee Mack and Sally Bretton return for another series of the broad domestic comedy about a pair of put-upon parents. Tonight\u2019s opener sees Lee clashing with Lucy\u2019s dad Geoffrey (Geoffrey Whitehead) as he tries to prove that he is DIY-competent. SH Civilisations BBC Two, 9.00pm This week\u2019s guide is Mary Beard, who brings her customary enthusiasm to this study of the human body. \u201cThe history of art is not just a history of artists, but also the history of the men and women who looked,\u201d she says, making a passionate plea for a populist interpretation. SH Rachel Nickell: The Untold Story ITV, 9.00pm Fiona Bruce presents this documentary about the 1992 murder of Rachel Nickell. The victim\u2019s youth plus the presence of her young son at the crime, meant pressure was placed on police to get a quick result. SH Jessica Jones Netflix, from today Krysten Ritter\u2019s cynical, damaged detective returns for a second run of Marvel\u2019s superhero series \u2013 and all the evidence suggests that dispatching last season\u2019s villain Kilgrave (David Tennant) hasn\u2019t helped at all. Instead, her anger issues are worse and her drinking as heavy. But Jessica can\u2019t outrun her demons for long and she\u2019s soon confronting her past in a plotline that looks set to get very dark indeed. SH\u00a0 Brooklyn Nine-Nine E4, 9.00pm If you\u2019re not watching this comedy about a hapless group of New York police officers, then you really should start. That said, the first part\u00a0of this two-part season opener is darker than usual as it turns out that detectives Jake (Andy Samberg) and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) really are in jail for crimes they didn\u2019t commit. There are still some good jokes amid the heavy lifting, however, and the deadpan Andre Braugher continues to steal the show as Captain Raymond Holt. SH Gilda (1946)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Film4, 11.00am Of all the noir women in all the noir films, none betters siren Rita Hayworth in this sultry tale. The film is narrated by a gambler (Glenn Ford) who is hired by a casino owner (George Macready) to keep an eye on his wife (Hayworth). She smoulders memorably as she slips off a glove to Put the Blame on Mame, at which point the film also addresses the question of femme-fatale misogyny. It\u2019s one of the greatest Hollywood movies. Batman Begins\u00a0(2005)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 5STAR, 9.00pm After the superb Batman in 1989, this comic-book franchise took a nosedive and reached its nadir with the Batman & Robin in 1997. However, Christopher Nolan revived it, casting Christian Bale as the lead in a reboot trilogy. This first instalment strips away everything in the comic-book mythos that didn\u2019t serve the film at hand and tells of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. The balance of emotion and action is perfect. Career Girls (1997)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 London Live, 10.00pm Following the success of Secrets & Lies, a gentler Mike Leigh focuses on the contrast between youth and maturity in this affecting comedy drama about two former college room-mates. The painfully shy Annie (Lynda Steadman) and the complex Hannah (Katrin Cartlide) are reminded of their past, of how far they\u2019ve come and how far they\u2019ve got to go. Look out for a young Andy Serkis as a champagne-swigging flirt. Friday 9 March Russia's President Vladimir Putin Credit: Tass Putin: The New Tsar BBC Two, 9.00pm One week before the Russian presidential elections, in which Vladimir Putin is running for a fourth time, this documentary explores his rise to power. His is a painstaking journey, taking the controversial leader from lowly beginnings in a tiny St Petersburg flat, through the rank and file of the KGB, to becoming Boris Yeltsin\u2019s right-hand man and successor in the Kremlin.\u00a0 Equal amounts of acclaim and approbation have followed him along the way, and the film negotiates these extremes by speaking to those who have had close dealings with the man himself. Putin\u2019s Former confidante Sergei Pugachev, spills the beans on his own falling out of favour with the Kremlin; chessmaster Garry Kasparov reflects on his failed attempt to stand against Putin, and exiled businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky reveals what it\u2019s like to face Putin\u2019s wrath first hand. British politicians have their say too. Former Conservative MP William Hague describes how he entertained Putin during the 2012 Olympic Games and how they bonded over their shared love of Judo. Such bonhomie however proved worthless when Hague failed to influence Putin\u2019s decision to invade Crimea. TD Winter Paralympics Opening Ceremony Live Channel 4, 10.55am Rob Walker, Sean Rose and Ade Adepitan are live from PyeongChang Olympic Stadium as Channel 4 begins 10 days of compelling winter sport action. But first, they guide us through\u00a0the opening ceremony\u00a0of the 12th Winter Paralympic Games. Gardeners\u2019 World BBC Two, 8.30pm; not Wales Spring is in the air as the long-running horticultural strand returns for a new series. At Longmeadow, Monty Don assesses winter damage, serves up seasonal hints and looks at ways to reduce plastic in his garden. TD Requiem BBC One, 9.00pm In the penultimate episode of this spooky drama, a determined Matilda (Lydia Wilson) brings local eccentric Laura (Anastasia Hille) to Dean House to see if she can use her spirit-channelling powers to figure out what happened to Carys. TD Jane McDonald & Friends Channel 5, 9.00pm Jane McDonald returns with a new series showcasing her vocal chops. Backed each week by a live band, the singer performs some of her favourite songs, helped along the way by special guests. This week\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d are soul singer Alexander O\u2019Neal and ex-Westlife member Shane Filan. TD Tones, Drones and Arpeggios: The Magic of Minimalism BBC Four, 9.00pm In this concluding part of this fascinating exploration of minimalism, conductor Charles Hazlewood shifts his focus to New York. There he meets minimalism\u2019s greatest living exponents Philip Glass and Steve Reich, whose iconoclastic approach produced works that are \u201cangular, unrelenting, as powerful as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u201d. TD Rough Justice More4, 9.00pm More4\u2019s foreign drama strand Walter Presents heads to Belgium for this new series. It\u2019s an intriguing set-up, even if the show\u2019s ingredients are overly familiar. There\u2019s the suitably moody Antwerp setting, an enigmatic protagonist in statuesque, straight-talking Superintendent Liese Meerhout (Hilde De Baerdemaeker) and\u00a0a knotty case coloured with violence. The first episode builds around the harbourside murder of a local journalist, whose dogged investigative methods have previously caused problems. TD The Outsider\u00a0(2018) Netflix, from today Netflix\u2019s latest film has already faced an immediate whitewashing backlash for casting American actor Jared Leto as a yakuza member in a story about the organised crime groups that work in the shadows in Japan. Many have questioned why The Outsider centres itself around a non-Asian character in an Asian setting and have called for a better Asian-American representation in Hollywood. Tadanobu Asano and Rory Cochrane also star. Wonder Woman (2017)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Sky Cinema Premiere, 3.35pm and 9.45pm Wonder Woman is close to a knockout on its own ambitious terms and also a thrillingly staged blow for feminism: of the 55 comic-book films produced by Hollywood in the last decade, zero have been centred on a female lead. It\u2019s set in the First World War during which demigoddess Diana (Gal Gadot) battles her way to the Western Front, where Ares, a foe of old, is overdue a thwarting. Reservoir Dogs (1992)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 ITV4, 11.30pm Quentin Tarantino\u2019s directing debut became a notable cult success, re-adrenalising the gangster film. Even though it\u2019s heartless and violent, it\u2019s well written and extremely entertaining. A failed robbery has consequences for the thugs who dress like the Blues Brothers and whose colour-coded pseudonyms include Mr White (Harvey Keitel), Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) and\u00a0Mr Orange (Tim Roth).

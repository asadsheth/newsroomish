updates outlook on Cueto, details next step for Giants pitcher","summary":"SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Johnny Cueto was preparing for the worst. The Giants starter felt terrible pain in his right elbow and after a dominant start to his 2018 season, Cueto felt he was destined to undergo Tommy John surgery. But an early May visit to Dr. James Andrews, a leading sports orthopedic surgeon, confirmed Cueto suffered a sprain and not a tear in his elbow, allowing the pitcher to rehab and rest. San Francisco placed the right-hander on the 60-day disabled list, which means he's not eligible to return to the club until June 30 at the earliest.

With Ayton off the board, it was a sizeable landslide of votes that made Doncic, the do-it-all guard who has been tearing up professional ball in Europe the past year, the community's second pick. So, who is this Real Madrid menace coming to the NBA? Doncic is a basketball prodigy, full-stop.

Once Singer took the mound, he showed little rust during Saturday night's 3-2 win against Jacksonville University the NCAA Gainesville Regional. A dicey fifth inning yielded the Dolphins their first run. Singer served up a solo home run to right fielder Cory Garrastazu in the seventh inning. Otherwise, Singer, expected to be a top-five pick during Monday's draft, was in command during his first start since May 11 against Georgia. \u201cI never missed a start before this injury,\u201d","published_at":1527994793,"content_id":"e99694c3-e47a-3d2d-8c27-5c2c645d2489","content_url":"http:\/\/www.orlandosentinel.com\/sports\/florida-gators\/swamp-things-blog\/os-sp-gators-baseball-ncaas-20180602-story.html","content_published_at":1527996600,"content_time":1527996600,"content_relative_time":39,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":39,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"405928e4-8562-3bd4-8b71-b170443e9438","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-4a0653b0-4a35-31c5-b752-b7305ce45cfc_a-405928e4-8562-3bd4-8b71-b170443e9438","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-4a0653b0-4a35-31c5-b752-b7305ce45cfc_a-405928e4-8562-3bd4-8b71-b170443e9438","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/mickey-lolich-ilitch-dashed-pizza-4j5vpo2","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Detroit News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/sports\/mlb\/tigers\/2018\/06\/03\/mickey-lolich-book-excerpt\/650271002\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zNCDtoZyrq2QnqQVw4NK3A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yfDbURmzTzINpRuVnOmdOA--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_405928e4-8562-3bd4-8b71-b170443e9438--402965229.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ch8l9lWBy5WoJ8n878LKRQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yfDbURmzTzINpRuVnOmdOA--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_405928e4-8562-3bd4-8b71-b170443e9438--402965229.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yfDbURmzTzINpRuVnOmdOA--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_405928e4-8562-3bd4-8b71-b170443e9438--402965229.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"Mickey Lolich: How Ilitch dashed his pizza career dream","summary":"Read an excerpt from his new book, 'Joy in Tigertown,' in which the World Series hero works for the pizza king Mickey Lolich pitched for 16 years in the major leagues, the first 13 with the Detroit Tigers.\u00a0 When he retired, he had the most strikeouts of any left-hander\u00a0in any league.

offense comes up short again as losing streak extends to seven with 8-5 loss to Yankees","summary":"For the honor of breaking the arbitrary three-run ceiling for the first time in a week, the Orioles got plenty of mock praise and a seventh straight loss for their troubles, 8-5 to the New York Yankees after a 104-minute rain delay Saturday at Camden Yards. How the American League's least-productive offense at 3.7 runs per game managed to score even that many, considering the context of this winless homestand, this second seven-game losing streak in five weeks and this sorry season, goes to show just how hard it has been for them to do anything productive at the dish of late. \u201cWe've been talking about that for a while, just putting together a lot of quality at-bats,\u201d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. Consider this: Before Saturday, the last time the Orioles got a leadoff man on base and scored him was a full week ago, in the seventh inning of their eventual 5-1 loss at the Tampa Bay Rays.","published_at":1527989729,"content_id":"ba6f73dc-a6dd-3629-8146-8665fedb3d6f","content_url":"http:\/\/www.baltimoresun.com\/sports\/orioles\/blog\/bs-sp-orioles-yankees-offense-20180602-story.html","content_published_at":1527989400,"content_time":1527989400,"content_relative_time":41,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":41,"comment_relative_time":41,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

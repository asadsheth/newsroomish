A few weeks into his career, Kingery has given strong hints that the Phillies made a wise decision to lock him up: he's flashed extra-base power (seven doubles and two home runs in his first 73 plate appearances), speed (three steals in as many attempts), and a flair for the dramatic, slugging his first career home run, hitting a grand slam, and driving in the game winning run on consecutive nights in a mid-April sweep of the Reds. Through three minor league seasons, Kingery played 303 games at second base, four at third base, and two at shortstop\u2014and those last six games only came toward the end of his 2017 season at triple-A Allentown.","published_at":1524500498,"content_id":"bb64a016-4348-346a-adf5-dadf52de4c34","content_url":"https:\/\/www.thegoodphight.com\/2018\/4\/23\/17268980\/scott-kingery-on-pace-to-make-more-history","content_published_at":1524459600,"content_time":1524459600,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":14,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"caba4845-01c0-32fa-8432-c577c2e84562","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-1540dc10-bc16-3df9-9548-3a4a01f4e2ad_a-caba4845-01c0-32fa-8432-c577c2e84562","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-1540dc10-bc16-3df9-9548-3a4a01f4e2ad_a-caba4845-01c0-32fa-8432-c577c2e84562","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/ortiz-cardinals-better-theyve-shown-2zrklwj","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"stltoday.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.stltoday.com\/sports\/columns\/jose-de-jesus-ortiz\/ortiz-cardinals-better-than-they-ve-shown-on--win\/article_bede20df-5acf-53df-ae82-d9221b228016.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1N.mCAm9ebwRQjc2iUVU6w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dyv.fVZHsLgBEwylkE8fRw--\/dz01MTI7aD0yODg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_caba4845-01c0-32fa-8432-c577c2e84562-336971109.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c8PxjjWNSAD_xQWSDDPj2A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yODg7dz01MTI7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dyv.fVZHsLgBEwylkE8fRw--\/dz01MTI7aD0yODg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_caba4845-01c0-32fa-8432-c577c2e84562-336971109.jpeg","height":288,"width":512,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dyv.fVZHsLgBEwylkE8fRw--\/dz01MTI7aD0yODg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_caba4845-01c0-32fa-8432-c577c2e84562-336971109.jpeg","imgw":512,"imgh":288,"title":"Ortiz: Cardinals better than they've shown on their 100-win pace","summary":"Few people, if any, would bet that the Cardinals will win at least 100 games this season.

Sox Injuries: Alex Cora Gives Latest On Tyler Thornburg, Steven Wright","summary":"Despite the Boston Red Sox's tremendous start to the season, they are dealing with their fair share of injuries. Xander Bogaerts is chief among them, given the shortstop was clubbing the ball prior to getting hurt April 8. However, he's supposed to be activated Friday. But also out are pitchers Steven Wright and Tyler Thornburg. Before Saturday's 3-0 loss to the Oakland Athletics, Sox manager Alex Cora provided updates on both pitchers. Wright exited his first rehab start in Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday with back stiffness. Though he only threw 2 2\/3 innings by the time he left, he already had tossed 61 pitches, allowing three runs (two earned) on five hits, with three strikeouts and two walks.","published_at":1524402225,"content_id":"28906ede-5410-3862-b8f8-82e3eaa98d1f","content_url":"https:\/\/nesn.com\/2018\/04\/red-sox-injuries-alex-cora-gives-latest-on-tyler-thornburg-steven-wright\/","content_published_at":1524407601,"content_time":1524407601,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":29,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"345103df-5a2f-33bf-9dd0-455272314c8f","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-9e48d4ee-4dc5-3c32-842d-7e120c8a78f5_a-345103df-5a2f-33bf-9dd0-455272314c8f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-9e48d4ee-4dc5-3c32-842d-7e120c8a78f5_a-345103df-5a2f-33bf-9dd0-455272314c8f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/daily-red-sox-links-xander-2c1nz32","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Over the Monster","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.overthemonster.com\/2018\/4\/22\/17267046\/boston-red-sox-news-xander-bogaerts-blake-swihart-john-farrell","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HdFzy029PsbuI6V_362Dlg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SJ3JDpvUXIBN8nSL0uyHag--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_345103df-5a2f-33bf-9dd0-455272314c8f-885705619.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xw1uzsGkfuZ0FguG6zcYsw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SJ3JDpvUXIBN8nSL0uyHag--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_345103df-5a2f-33bf-9dd0-455272314c8f-885705619.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SJ3JDpvUXIBN8nSL0uyHag--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_345103df-5a2f-33bf-9dd0-455272314c8f-885705619.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"Daily Red Sox Links: Xander Bogaerts, Blake Swihart, John Farrell","summary":"Brian MacPherson has a look at Boston's new aggressive approach and just how much it's paying off already.

On Sunday, DeJong positioned himself up the middle three times, and was there waiting for a ground ball that otherwise would have been a single. While other spots in the infield have been rotated based on matchups, hot streaks and injuries. DeJong has been the stalwart. Only left fielder Marcell Ozuna comes close on his time card.

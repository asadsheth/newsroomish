The Winter Meetings are over, and there wasn't a lot of activity overall. A few relievers signed, but the most prominent rumor out of Orlando was the serious interest in Manny Machado, especially from the White Sox. What does this rumor mean? How would adding Machado now help the White Sox rebuild? Are they ready for a quick transition from rebuilder to contender? What kind of deal would make sense in acquiring Machado? Is it even worth it? We tackle those questions and yours as we conclude our 2017 podcast season.

The San Francisco Giants ($203 million), Chicago Cubs ($183 million), Los Angeles Dodgers ($180 million) and the Washington Nationals ($180 million) round out the top five. The New York Yankees come in at seventh with a projected payroll of $167 million, which, according to the AP, would be their lowest since the 2003 season.

MLB faces left looking for work as rosters are finalized","summary":"Cincinnati outfielder Ben Revere, Washington starting pitcher Jeremy Hellickson and St. Louis reliever Jason Motte were among the latest cuts as big-league teams reached a deadline to make roster decisions. Sunday was the last day for teams to choose what to do with players who chose to become free agents after the World Series and later signed minor league contracts. Clubs could either opt to add them to the 25-man roster for Thursday's Opening Day, release them or pay a $100,000 retention bonus if they agreed to begin the season in the minors. Toronto reliever Tyler Clippard, who recently signed after working out at a camp for free agents in Florida, will begin with the Blue Jays.

if the NFL used a standardized prospect grading system like MLB?","summary":"When talking about NFL prospects, there are a wide range of ranking systems available. Some folks may grade potential NFL draftees with a ranking from zero to 8; others may rank out of 100. Some just say a guy has talent equatable to a particular round, such as being a first round or second round talent. While you will also find some evaluations which just give a somewhat useless sequential positional ranking. In a multi billion dollar business, there's got to be a better way - right? That's why I think football could benefit from implementing something akin to the common prospect grading system used in professional baseball.

wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and Meghan","summary":"The Royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is now just over a week away, which means the final preparations for the big day will no doubt be being tweaked and polished as you read. The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor; it will include\u00a0two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service. Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week.\u00a0 The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and\u00a0the wedding of the\u00a0Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday; on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday. While\u00a0Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year's royal nuptials,\u00a0pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself. Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She\u00a0said: \u201cThe Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion. \u201cI hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.\u201d Here is everything you need to know about how the\u00a0big day will unfold. WATCH:\u00a0 How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal Wedding The service The service will take place at St George\u2019s Chapel in the grounds of\u00a0Windsor Castle, which\u00a0last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when\u00a0Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess\u00a0of Wessex, there in June 1999; plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. Members of the public who have been invited to watch\u00a0from the grounds of Windsor Castle will \u00a0begin to arrive from 9am. Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach.\u00a0Two driving routes have been suggested,\u00a0with guests required to meet at the\u00a0Windsor Farm Shop \u2013\u00a0founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce. There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification; they will then be\u00a0ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle's Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door. Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to \"surrender mobile telephones and any devices used for image capture\". The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: \"No swords.\" At 11:20am, members of the Royal\u00a0Family will\u00a0arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car\u00a0from the Royal Mews, including\u00a0Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers. A view of the Quire in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding service Credit: \u00a0WPA Pool Prince\u00a0Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel's west steps at 11:45am.\u00a0 It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather\u00a0in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps. The Queen will\u00a0be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am. The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel's west steps at 11:59am. She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George\u2019s Chapel by car.\u00a0The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony. Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch. The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all time Meghan's father will meet her at the chapel's west door, before walking\u00a0her down the aisle. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.\u00a0 Under the guidance of Harry's private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain's Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day. It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This\u00a0allows the bride to drop the phrases \"obey him\" and \"serve him\" from the religious proceedings.\u00a0Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring;\u00a0William does not wear one. The\u00a0regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan\u00a0will also have a \"special place\"\u00a0during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George's Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General. The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant. Royal wedding | Read more The procession The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle\u00a0by carriage.\u00a0 Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u00a0will be driven for two miles along\u00a0Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. Kensington Palace has said: \"Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.\" While we don't know for sure how long the procession will take, a\u00a0similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes. The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George\u2019s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view. The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in London Credit: Victoria Jones The newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage,\u00a0Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is\u00a0the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys. Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: \"The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it's a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there's lots of visibility for everybody. \"It was built in 1883, it's one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.\" If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows\u00a0and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers. Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride. A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders. All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year,\u00a0Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor's Show.\u00a0 Map of the route Wedding route The receptions They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George's Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen. While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George's Hall\u00a0to celebrate the first of the day's two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and\u00a0will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service. Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests; royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George\u2019s Chapel is relatively small\u00a0and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession. Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore House Credit: \u00a0REUTERS From 7pm,\u00a0a select 200 close friends will attend\u00a0an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is\u00a0part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of\u00a0the Home Park. Prince Harry and Ms Markle's engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer\u00a0Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen\u00a0to take the photographs on the wedding day.\u00a0 Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father,\u00a0also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince\u00a0Alexi Lubomirski. It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle's family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception \u2013\u00a0although Princess Charlotte and Prince\u00a0George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight. Royal wedding | Read more Will Prince William be at the FA Cup? It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry's best man.\u00a0The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding. Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and\u00a0Manchester United go head to head for the title.\u00a0Windsor Castle is about an hour's drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least\u00a0two hours. Asked how he felt about being chosen as\u00a0Prince Harry\u2019s best man, the Duke said: \u201cIt feels great. [I am] thrilled and delighted obviously.\u00a0Revenge is sweet. I\u2019ll be looking forward to it.\u201d The Duke\u2019s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.

Royal Wedding rules to leave relatives waiting in the car park","summary":"When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on Saturday, millions will watch on their televisions at home. A lucky few will have an exclusive invite to the chapel, while others may gather to watch an outdoor screen at a public party. A select handful will have a rather different experience: watching from their iPads in a farm shop carpark. The Royal wedding will see the partners of some invited guests left out of the celebrations for reasons of space, with unmarried friends or those who do\u00a0not\u00a0know the couple so well asked to leave their girlfriends and boyfriends outside. The complicated logistics of the day will see guests dropped off for security checks at the Windsor Farm Shop, boarding buses which will then take them to St George's Chapel for the ceremony. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday Credit: PA One guest, who said she \"totally understood\" the restrictions, said her husband would be watching the ceremony from a tablet computer in the carpark where he dropped her off, waiting dutifully to return after the champagne and canapes are over. Others will be chauffered by their partners to the official drop-off point before leaving them to their own devices in Windsor. A source told the Sunday Telegraph that some girlfriends had been disappointed with their lack of invitation, after holding out tentative hopes of attending the \"wedding of the century\" by virtue of their partner's\u00a0friendship with the couple.\u00a0 After The Wedding Route \"It's the only real sad bit about it,\" the guest said. \"It's very, very difficult for them to have everyone: obviously they've got a great deal of friends and family but they're quite confined in numbers and space. \"For anyone who isn't\u00a0not\u00a0married, they've only invited the friend unless they're really good friends with both of them.\" The makeshift rule, employed by many couples as they plan their wedding day with restricted numbers, has been colloquially called \"no\u00a0ring,\u00a0no\u00a0bring\". The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all time The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who married in 2011 at Westminster Abbey with more than triple the number of guests, employed a similar policy for those they did\u00a0not\u00a0know well. Then, a friend of a Lord Lieutenant who was attending the wedding told the Sunday Telegraph: \"What makes it worse is that he would be happy to watch it on TV. It's his wife who's desperate to be there. She had already bought her hat.\" Pippa Middleton and husband James Matthews Credit: Rex Features Last year, it was reported that Pippa Middleton had put in place a similar restriction. In the event, Ms Markle, who was\u00a0not\u00a0yet engaged to Prince Harry, did discreetly attend the evening do with Prince Harry, opting to remain out of sight of the cameras to avoid attracting attention.\u00a0","published_at":1526226450,"content_id":"42e407bd-5bd9-3377-b4fd-e0d103c63b94","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/no-ring-no-bring-royal-180000756.html","content_published_at":1526148000,"content_time":1526148000,"content_relative_time":46,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Royal family","vibe_id":"6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":46,"comment_relative_time":46,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"42f8f9af-64af-3548-b15b-5e47f008f1f4","post_id":"v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-a63a7c11-8466-34f3-8566-aa6110b2ebc8_a-42f8f9af-64af-3548-b15b-5e47f008f1f4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-a63a7c11-8466-34f3-8566-aa6110b2ebc8_a-42f8f9af-64af-3548-b15b-5e47f008f1f4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/royal-family\/v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-a63a7c11-8466-34f3-8566-aa6110b2ebc8_a-42f8f9af-64af-3548-b15b-5e47f008f1f4","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Brides","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.brides.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-07-13\/66cedad0-4907-11e6-b37a-870ab068282c_64x64-icons_brides.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/prince-harry-become-duke-sussex-211523050.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/inlNDWVOLr2bWnLJAIfhmA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/brides_832\/6c8f1aeff4f9b5411802ad46ba6ba74f","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lj9Dh0F3p7yGJGt6GhqZKw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMzg3O3c9MzUwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/brides_832\/6c8f1aeff4f9b5411802ad46ba6ba74f","height":2387,"width":3500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/brides_832\/6c8f1aeff4f9b5411802ad46ba6ba74f","imgw":3500,"imgh":2387,"title":"Prince Harry To Become Duke of Sussex After Royal Wedding","summary":"This title hasn't been used since 1843.","published_at":1526176814,"content_id":"42f8f9af-64af-3548-b15b-5e47f008f1f4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/prince-harry-become-duke-sussex-211523050.html","content_published_at":1526159723,"content_time":1526159723,"content_relative_time":43,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Royal family","vibe_id":"6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":43,"comment_relative_time":43,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

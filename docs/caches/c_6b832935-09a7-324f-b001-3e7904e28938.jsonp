The local council in Coburg, birthplace of both Queen Victoria\u2019s mother and her beloved consort, Prince Albert, says there will be no cross on display in the town hall when the controversial order comes into effect on Friday. The order, issued by the new Bavarian regional prime minister, Markus S\u00f6der, has caused huge public controversy across Germany. Mr S\u00f6der says the cross is \u201ca fundamental symbol of our Bavarian identity and way of life\u201d. But his opponents say he is exploiting a religious symbol for political ends and have denounced the move as unconstitutional. In Coburg, in the former Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the local authorities are taking an independent stance. Norbert Tessmer, the mayor, told the local Neue Presse newspaper he had decided there was no obligation to hang a cross in the town hall as it belongs to the local municipality, and not the regional government.\u00a0 But he conceded crosses would have to be hung in other local public buildings such as the tax office and the law courts.

Nuremberg\u2019s famous Neues Musuem is refusing point blank to display a cross, even though it is a public institution. \u201cIt is problematic to make such a display in an institution concerned with the freedom of the arts,\u201d Eva Kraus, the museum director said.\u00a0 The Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich is also taking a stand. \u201cWe have nothing against crosses of any kind, but they should only hang where they belong: in church,\u201d Michael Kr\u00fcger, the academy president said. A spokesman for the Bavarian interior ministry admitted last week that it would not be possible for the ministry to enforce the order in every case.\u00a0 Public protests are planned in Munich on Friday, but a recent poll found 56 per cent of Bavarians in fact support the order, with only 38 per cent against. Support is strong among Roman Catholics, who make up 58 per cent of Bavaria\u2019s population. The order has been endorsed by the Catholic Archbishop of Bamberg, Ludwig Schick.\u00a0 But some of the strongest opposition to the order has come from the church. A leading Catholic theologian accused Mr S\u00f6der of exploiting people\u2019s fears over Muslim migrants ahead of regional elections. \u201cYou are using Christianity to exclude people of other faiths,\u201d Burkhard Hose wrote in an open letter to Mr S\u00f6der. \u201cThe cross is not an extension of a policy of exclusion or nationalistic egoism... I urge you to stop using Christianity as a supposed bulwark against Islam.\u201d The move has also been criticised by the head of the German evangelical church, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm., who warned: \u201cIt is very clear that no one should misuse a religious symbol like the cross for political purposes\u201d.","published_at":1527767414,"content_id":"ad62836b-6159-30eb-8ca4-8b0c84953c99","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/small-bavarian-town-linked-british-114055310.html","content_published_at":1527766855,"content_time":1527766855,"content_relative_time":102,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Royal family","vibe_id":"6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":102,"comment_relative_time":102,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

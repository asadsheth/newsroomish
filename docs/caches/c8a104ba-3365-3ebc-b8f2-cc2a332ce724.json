For the first time, USP brings a unified, common approach to securely deploy, manage, and control network-aware consumer electronics, including home and enterprise Wi-Fi, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. This enables a vast number of devices from different suppliers to be integrated into service providers' offerings, enabling them to offer new, revenue-generating services to end-users. \"As an evolution of the popular TR-069 standard, USP makes use of the same data models, but instead of simply having a single Auto Configuration Server, there are now many end points that control not only the devices but also individual executables on each one,\" said Barbara Stark, of AT&T, USP Project Lead at Broadband Forum.","published_at":1524010401,"content_id":"a6f3e4a9-70e6-30b2-9990-e3f1bb55d307","content_url":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/Broadband-Forum-brings-IoT-home-with-new-USP-standard-1021436394","content_published_at":1523977200,"content_time":1523977200,"content_relative_time":51,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Internet of Things","vibe_id":"c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724_c-bb1ff580-160b-389e-a780-d8fe51e4ad68_a-adc8ec37-8d92-362c-a183-1c2eef3f4b0a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/internet-of-things\/twilio-programmable-wireless-now-available-6c764c9","author":"nanook","provider":"markets.businessinsider.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/Twilio-Programmable-Wireless-Now-Available-Empowering-Millions-of-Developers-to-Deliver-IoT-Experiences-1021436494","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zAjfFNqUrMxp9M2wFa72OA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7H67Lf90shAwPp8zFkn7Ew--\/dz0zMDA7aD0yNDk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_adc8ec37-8d92-362c-a183-1c2eef3f4b0a-931379032.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eh8TPH3facciaaRiFRotMQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDk7dz0zMDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7H67Lf90shAwPp8zFkn7Ew--\/dz0zMDA7aD0yNDk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_adc8ec37-8d92-362c-a183-1c2eef3f4b0a-931379032.jpeg","height":249,"width":300,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7H67Lf90shAwPp8zFkn7Ew--\/dz0zMDA7aD0yNDk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_adc8ec37-8d92-362c-a183-1c2eef3f4b0a-931379032.jpeg","imgw":300,"imgh":249,"title":"Twilio Programmable Wireless Now Available: Empowering Millions of Developers to Deliver IoT Experiences","summary":"Programmable Wireless unleashes the creativity of millions of developers to deliver on the industry's vision of billions of connected devices Twilio Programmable Wireless takes Twilio's developer-first approach that disrupted the communications industry and applies it to the Internet of Things Innovators including iBeat, LimeBike and System One are using Twilio Programmable Wireless to unlock new markets and transform their industries SAN FRANCISCO, April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), the leading cloud communications platform, today announced general availability of Twilio Programmable Wireless, a cellular communications platform that uses simple APIs to power a wide range","published_at":1524005338,"content_id":"adc8ec37-8d92-362c-a183-1c2eef3f4b0a","content_url":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/Twilio-Programmable-Wireless-Now-Available-Empowering-Millions-of-Developers-to-Deliver-IoT-Experiences-1021436494","content_published_at":1523977200,"content_time":1523977200,"content_relative_time":51,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Internet of Things","vibe_id":"c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

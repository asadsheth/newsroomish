That's the problem for which Gourmia's new IoT Cool-Cooker aims to provide a solution. The device has a built-in refrigeration unit, so you can pop ingredients into the pot in the morning and keep them cold until you want it to start cooking. Using Gourmia's mobile app, you can remotely instruct the cooker to start cooking, or you can delay cooking if you're running a little late from work. You can remotely control the temperature of the device and monitor the cooking process as well.

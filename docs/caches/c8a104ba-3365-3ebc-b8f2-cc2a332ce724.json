Hence, proper supply chain management is a key to every consumer-based business. How likely would Amazon still be in business if their SCM were poor? Given the financial and technical resources the large companies possess, they employ a complex set of SCM solutions however they are still affected and fall short of being efficient when it comes to dealing with certain factors like intermediary channels, lack of visibility of assets etc. With the world spending on IoT to reach an estimated $772.5 billion in 2018, IDC further estimates that the connectedness would improve the productivity in manufacturing supply chain by 15%.","published_at":1527163541,"content_id":"827c4be5-9a17-3296-9b1f-685020238281","content_url":"https:\/\/readwrite.com\/2018\/05\/24\/iot-solution-to-supply-chain-management\/","content_published_at":1527145200,"content_time":1527145200,"content_relative_time":156,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Internet of Things","vibe_id":"c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

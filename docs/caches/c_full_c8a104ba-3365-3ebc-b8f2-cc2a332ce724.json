For the first time, USP brings a unified, common approach to securely deploy, manage, and control network-aware consumer electronics, including home and enterprise Wi-Fi, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. This enables a vast number of devices from different suppliers to be integrated into service providers' offerings, enabling them to offer new, revenue-generating services to end-users. \"As an evolution of the popular TR-069 standard, USP makes use of the same data models, but instead of simply having a single Auto Configuration Server, there are now many end points that control not only the devices but also individual executables on each one,\" said Barbara Stark, of AT&T, USP Project Lead at Broadband Forum.","published_at":1524010401,"content_id":"a6f3e4a9-70e6-30b2-9990-e3f1bb55d307","content_url":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/Broadband-Forum-brings-IoT-home-with-new-USP-standard-1021436394","content_published_at":1523977200,"content_time":1523977200,"content_relative_time":52,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Internet of Things","vibe_id":"c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":52,"comment_relative_time":52,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

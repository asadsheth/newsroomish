Over the last decade, reports have increasingly detailed the flaws and vulnerabilities that can plague insecure implementations of a set of networking protocols called Universal Plug and Play. To pull that off, hackers are using UPnP weaknesses in commercial routers and other devices to reroute their traffic over and over again until it's nearly impossible to trace. \"We started talking about how many of these vulnerable devices are out there and what can they be leveraged for, because most people seem to have forgotten about this vulnerability,\" says Chad Seaman, a senior engineer

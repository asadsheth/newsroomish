For the first time, USP brings a unified, common approach to securely deploy, manage, and control network-aware consumer electronics, including home and enterprise Wi-Fi, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. This enables a vast number of devices from different suppliers to be integrated into service providers' offerings, enabling them to offer new, revenue-generating services to end-users. \"As an evolution of the popular TR-069 standard, USP makes use of the same data models, but instead of simply having a single Auto Configuration Server, there are now many end points that control not only the devices but also individual executables on each one,\" said Barbara Stark, of AT&T, USP Project Lead at Broadband

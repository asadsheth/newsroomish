The big-bodied receiver from SMU was the third wide receiver selected in the 2018 draft behind D.J. Moore (Carolina Panthers, 24th overall) and Calvin Ridley (Atlanta Falcons, 26th overall). As Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders approach the end of their contracts with Denver, and with so much uncertainty behind them at the position, Sutton has the opportunity to develop into a mainstay for the Broncos. If Elway's talent evaluation is correct, the Broncos landed a gem in the second round.

But in the eyes of the law and regulatory systems, professional football players are, in fact, employees of the NFL.

One of the members of that secondary, Kavon Frazier, had a bit to say about that and even went as far as poking fun at Mathieu's nickname. Jourdan Lewis also subtweeted Tyrann; the Cowboys clearly took notice. Every day in practice the secondary goes up against the Cowboys receivers. It looks like they'll both have some motivation in the form of doubters as the wideouts are the latest to have their talents called into question. ESPN's Matthew Berry called them the worst receiving corps in the NFL. The worst.

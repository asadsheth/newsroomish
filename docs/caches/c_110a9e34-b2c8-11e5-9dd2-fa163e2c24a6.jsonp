Of course, that wasn't actually what Donald Trump was ranting about. This was a year not so much dominated by protest in the NFL as by the hyperbolic reaction to it. What began in 2016 as a lone player's attempt to raise awareness of unequal treatment of minorities in America has instead been contorted into a toxic discourse on patriotism and free speech.

Well, it looks like one is about to hit the open market. That's right, Saints quarterback Drew Brees is set to hit free agency. While it's almost a certainty that Brees will finish his career in New Orleans, no deal is in place as the legal tampering period approaches. It would be a no-brainer for the Jets to throw everything they have at the 39-year-old signal caller. Brees showed no signs of slowing down in 2017, throwing for 4,334 yards, 23 touchdowns and only eight interceptions.

Suddenly, the expectations for Cleveland's offseason have radically changed. Will free agents look at the team differently now as GM John Dorsey continues building a roster that fits his philosophy? Does having Taylor in the fold give the front office the flexibility to take Saquon Barkley No. 1 overall and go back to QB at No. 4 in the draft? As Landry tweeted, \"S--- about to get SERIOUS?.\" But as important as the combo of moves could turn out to be, for now they accentuate an addition Cleveland made weeks ago\u2014with significantly less profanity laden fanfare.See, Taylor and Landry are talented in idiosyncratic ways. Taylor is elite at limiting interceptions (throwing them at the lowest rate in the league last year), but he will also overlook open receivers, and he is at his best in a system that utilizes his running ability. Landry, meanwhile, was third-to-last among qualifying receivers in yards at catch; on average, he got the ball 4.4 yards away from the line of scrimmage. And they join a collection of unique assets already on the Browns roster, like 5'11\" wideout Corey Coleman or running back Duke Johnson, who had more receiving targets than rushes in 2017.When Todd Haley took to the podium for the first time as Cleveland's offensive coordinator on Valentine's Day, he said, \"What I believe in is playing to every player\u2019s strength that you have as best you can\u2014putting players into position to succeed, playing to their skillset.\" It's a bit of coach speak, but it's going to have to become his most important mantra. Haley figured out how to develop and deploy distinctive talents in Pittsburgh while building an explosive offense, but he's going to have to do it completely differently this time around. At the same time, Hue Jackson, who has surrendered offensive control and play-calling duties for the first time since coming to Cleveland, will have to figure out how he factors into all of this. The front office seems intent on bringing in pieces, but can the staff get them to fit? Not getting this newsletter in your inbox yet? Join The MMQB\u2019s Morning Huddle .

He said Taylor was \u201cthe most underrated\u201d option available at quarterback and that the new Brown reminds him of Russell Wilson.

The Cleveland Browns were the focal point of the sports world on the Friday before free agency, stealing all of the headlines with three trades being reported in a span of two hours. It might be tough to track everything that happened, so let's recap it all in this one post. IMPORTANT NOTE! Before we begin, remember that none of these trades can become official until 4:00 PM ET on Wednesday, March 14, which is the start of the new league year. At 4:22 PM, the first headline broke that the Miami Dolphins were trading WR Jarvis Landry to the Browns. In return, Cleveland is sending a fourth-round pick (No. 123 overall) in 2018 and a seventh-round pick in 2019 to Miami.

This ain't mock drafting In an effort to help readers be better prepared for the free agency period that will be upon us next week, the 5 o'clock club has been featuring free agent profiles for every position except Offensive Tackle, Quarterback, and special teams specialists. Since early January, we have profiled 78 players who were potential free agents. Some remain under contract (Dez Bryant), some have been franchise-tagged (Jarvis Landry), and some are probably going to be re-signed","published_at":1520682944,"content_id":"8f15857e-1db8-3f76-a615-64427734fd53","content_url":"https:\/\/www.hogshaven.com\/2018\/3\/10\/17019944\/the-5-oclock-club?src=rss","content_published_at":1520658000,"content_time":1520658000,"content_relative_time":110,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":110,"comment_relative_time":110,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"07137ec5-3093-3ceb-b6f4-889a535bce05","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-070cb600-60ba-3ae5-bc42-e8e93f1a19a4_a-07137ec5-3093-3ceb-b6f4-889a535bce05","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-070cb600-60ba-3ae5-bc42-e8e93f1a19a4_a-07137ec5-3093-3ceb-b6f4-889a535bce05","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/5-free-agents-texans-avoid-3ymqxc2","author":"third_watch","provider":"Khou","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.khou.com\/article\/sports\/nfl\/texans\/5-free-agents-for-the-texans-to-avoid\/285-527153433?src=rss","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SvFn7zop_ovGSTNuct8siQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/R9qWC._crW4Izy9xh05wTg--\/dz0yOTEyO2g9MTk0MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_07137ec5-3093-3ceb-b6f4-889a535bce05--809684095.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IaKND0B7NdojWikQQtACBQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xOTQxO3c9MjkxMjs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/R9qWC._crW4Izy9xh05wTg--\/dz0yOTEyO2g9MTk0MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_07137ec5-3093-3ceb-b6f4-889a535bce05--809684095.jpeg","height":1941,"width":2912,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/R9qWC._crW4Izy9xh05wTg--\/dz0yOTEyO2g9MTk0MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_07137ec5-3093-3ceb-b6f4-889a535bce05--809684095.jpeg","imgw":2912,"imgh":1941,"title":"5 free agents for the Texans to avoid","summary":"It's easy to try and figure out who the Houston Texans should sign to bolster the roster. But often NFL teams wind up making wise decisions by not signing a particular player, sometimes to the chagrin of the fan base attracted to a name or statistic. Knowing who to avoid will be critical for new Texans GM Brian Gaine. Here are five free agents Gaine and the Texans should avoid even though they do carry some level of attractiveness. Amukamara is not a bad player by any means. The veteran cornerback had a decent season with the Chicago Bears in 2017 and is a high-floor player. He's strong in run support, too. The problem with Amukamara is he's essentially Johnathan Joseph in coverage.

Let's take a break from all the quarterback speculation and focus on what the Vikings may do at the tight end spot when free agency opens next week. The Vikings have their clear No. 1 receiving tight end in Kyle Rudolph, the franchise's all-time leader in touchdown receptions. They have their rough-and-tumble\/blocking specialist in David Morgan II who may or may not be an actual Viking. What the team needs is someone in the middle of that contrast.

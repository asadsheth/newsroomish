Some teams did the obvious, some had to make some difficult financial decisions that will create a major domino effect on the free agent market and some teams tried to get cute.So let\u2019s break it all down, examining what this means moving forward: TAGGED Le\u2019Veon Bell, RB, Pittsburgh Steelers (exclusive)The stage is set for an absolutely memorable game of contractual ping-pong all offseason. Bell doubling down on his threat to retire, the Steelers talking up RB James Conner, Bell possibly holding out and all the glorious, agent-driven dirt that is sure to surface in the meantime. What complicates matters? Neither side is in the wrong. Bell is the best running back in football, and is maybe one of the 15 best wide receivers\u2014and he wants a deal that reflects as much. The Steelers, with a troika of highly-paid offensive players, are finding it hard to envision a long-term deal for a 26-year-old running back that has a history of significant injuries as well as suspensions.It\u2019s far more convenient for Pittsburgh from a financial perspective to take this one year at a time until the franchise tag jumps a third time next year. By then, Bell will be 27 and unlikely to secure as lucrative a long-term deal. In this matchup between an unstoppable force and immovable object, the only way Bell wins is by legitimately convincing the Steelers he\u2019s done if he doesn\u2019t get the long-term deal. Can that happen given Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s age and a closing Super Bowl window? Ziggy Ansah, DE, Detroit Lions (non-exclusive)The Lions and Ansah may talk about a long-term deal, but it would be surprising to see something signed before the July deadline. This is an ideal rental period for new head coach Matt Patricia, who is just now figuring out how he wants to stack this Lions defense. Ansah will be 29 years old before the season starts, and while his production has been elite at times, it has also been sporadic (Sacks per year: 8, 7.5, 14.5, 2, 12). Under the non-exclusive tag, Ansah gets more than $17 million for the season and another double-digit sack season could propel him into free agency at the preventative but not obsolete age of 30.\u2022 BENOIT: A Complete Ranking of the Best Free Agents on the Market DeMarcus Lawrence, DE, Dallas Cowboys (non-exclusive)Lawrence has handled this situation beautifully, and almost seems welcome to the prospect of playing out the year for $17.1 million. He recently told NFL Network, \u201cI feel like they have given me the opportunity to really break the bank next year.\u201dThe defensive end will turn 25 in two weeks, meaning that if he doesn\u2019t strike a long-term deal this season, he\u2019ll hit the open market in his contractual prime. This creates a hard decision for Jerry Jones, who must weigh Lawrence\u2019s potential (he went from a previous high of eight sacks in 2015 to 14.5 last year) against his consistency. Given Jones\u2019s admiration for home grown stars, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see him at least make a run at locking down the \u201cWar Daddy\u201d pass rusher he\u2019s always wanted. But Lawrence and his agents weren\u2019t born yesterday. Agent David Canter facilitated Olivier Vernon\u2019s record-breaking five-year, $85 million contract with the Giants back in 2016. Lawrence will cost more. Jarvis Landry, WR, Miami Dolphins (non-exclusive):The tagging of Landry has been more directly linked with trades given Miami\u2019s inability to sign the highly-productive wide receiver. ESPN reported that five teams, including Baltimore and Chicago, have at least checked in on a possible deal. Making a move for a franchise tagged player isn\u2019t easy, and it may occur after the meat of free agency is over. Clearly there are teams starved for wide-receiver talent that would be interested in someone who posted two seasons of 110 or more catches. Lamarcus Joyner, S, Los Angeles Rams (non-exclusive):Joyner\u2019s tag means WR Sammy Watkins will be able to test the waters. Unfortunately, Watkins\u2019s best option might be signing a high-end, one-year deal similar to those signed by Alshon Jeffery or Terrelle Pryor during last year\u2019s free agency. And really, the best place for him to end up might be back in Los Angeles playing for an explosive offensive mind like Sean McVay. The $11.2 million tag number for a safety is not overwhelmingly prohibitive if the Rams were interested in working out a longer-term deal before the deadline (the tag makes Joyner the fifth-highest paid safety in APY right now). TRANSITION TAGGED Kyle Fuller, CB, Chicago Bears:A potentially smart move for the Bears, who save $2 million up front by not using the franchise tag but still give themselves a chance to match any offer Fuller receives. The former first-round pick needs a healthy season to skyrocket himself near the top of the cornerback market next offseason. NOT TAGGED Allen Robinson, receiver, Jacksonville Jaguars: Coming off an injury, Robinson, like a few of the high-profile receivers last year, may be on the market for a one-year prove it deal. Graham Gano, kicker, Carolina Panthers: Gano signed a long-term, four-year deal on Tuesday. Andrew Norwell, guard, Carolina Panthers: The Panthers were not going to repeat mistakes of the past and get themselves wrapped up in a financial crisis. Norwell would be too expensive under the tag and will now go break the bank in free agency.","published_at":1520429332,"content_id":"474e3e49-8287-3646-931b-ea2c11fffa51","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-franchise-tag-apos-tagged-213656915.html","content_published_at":1520372216,"content_time":1520372216,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b8ec9b15-c1d8-3dd5-8a16-9238d73ae82f","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-896c6220-4689-33e7-8793-64524435b530_a-b8ec9b15-c1d8-3dd5-8a16-9238d73ae82f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

Johnson, who is not expected to return to the Los Angeles Rams after the Marcus Peters' trade, is a physical corner that the 49ers would love to have on their defense. He would pair up with Ahkello Witherspoon and they could form a solid secondary pairing. The 49ers have been looking to solidify their cornerback position for years and were never able to find a reliable starting corner. Ahkello developed into a solid player and won his starting spot, but Dontae Johnson never really panned out as the prior regime would have hoped. Another option for the 49ers would be to go after Kyle Fuller.

So did the Cleveland Browns, before the Miami Dolphins landed him, multiple sources told ESPN. The Dolphins sent fourth- and sixth-round draft picks to the Rams to nab Quinn, 27, who carried a $12.4 million cap hit in 2018. It is not currently known how much the Bucs or Browns were offering. The Bucs have eight draft selections this year and about $73 million in cap space heading into free agency, among the top five in the league.

The soon-to-be free agent was a big part of the Patriots' offense last season where he averaged 5.0 yards per carry, hauled in 32 passes and scored nine touchdowns (six on the ground, three through the air). According to Football Outsiders' metrics, Lewis ranked first among all running backs in total value, second in value per play and was top 10 in receiving. \u00a0 And assuming the Patriots don't re-sign Lewis before the start of free agency on March 14, the dynamic running back will have plenty of interest on the open market.

Part II","summary":"With the lack of a highly-productive wide receiver continuing to plague the Ravens, the second part of this series will discuss free agency options for bolstering the position and elevating the offense. As Mike Wallace enters free agency, the Ravens will have to decide if they want to keep him in Baltimore. In 2017, Wallace hauled in 20 fewer receptions for 269 less yards compared to his first season with the Ravens. At 31 years old and entering his 10th year in the league, it may be time for the Ravens to look towards a younger, more productive player. Jaguars wide receiver, Allen Robinson, is ranked fifth in the NFL's top 101 free agents.

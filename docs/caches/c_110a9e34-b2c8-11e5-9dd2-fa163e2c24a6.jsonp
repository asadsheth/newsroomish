Each team is permitted 30 official visits with prospective players, but in some circumstances visits don't count. For example, although the Steelers have hosted 4 players, if some of those prospects went to school, or where they grew up they wouldn't count towards their overall total. As pointed out by PennLive.com's Jacob Klinger, in 2017 before the NFL Draft when Michigan State safety Montae Nicholson visited the Steelers, the visit did not count against the Steelers' 30 due to the fact he grew up near Pittsburgh, Monroeville to be exact.

Owens, the former\u00a0Eagles wide receiver, is ready to do his part to help Beckham make it to Canton, taking to Twitter Tuesday with this offer: You'll notice Owens also called out former Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant, who remains\u00a0unsigned since being released by Dallas last month. Bryant is the best available free agent wide receiver as we head deep into the\u00a0NFL off-season training program. Perhaps working out with Owens would help Bryant land a new deal. But Owens' offer has a dual purpose, because\u00a0he wants to make a comeback.\u00a0 That's right.","published_at":1526560474,"content_id":"b570ef88-aba2-33e4-a45e-270583ec2a05","content_url":"http:\/\/www.nj.com\/giants\/index.ssf\/2018\/05\/eagles_terrell_owens_giants_odell_beckham_cowboys.html","content_published_at":1526533200,"content_time":1526533200,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":16,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"7a1076b2-54ed-3f5e-98df-7669a95c2ea5","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-3bacece5-dea0-3b54-8bfb-35f64794a329_a-7a1076b2-54ed-3f5e-98df-7669a95c2ea5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-3bacece5-dea0-3b54-8bfb-35f64794a329_a-7a1076b2-54ed-3f5e-98df-7669a95c2ea5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/sports-leagues-slash-price-money-3dk9ey9","author":"nanook","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","provider_url":"http:\/\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/","provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/sports-leagues-slash-price-money-235010018.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O7G0KPpKaUsuvIh0rgIk_Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/045220c5c0c5f0299e8e49d836d8ffa4","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FZ0M.k18ddXNi2dhaqmN8w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNTM7dz00NDk7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/045220c5c0c5f0299e8e49d836d8ffa4","height":253,"width":449,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/045220c5c0c5f0299e8e49d836d8ffa4","imgw":449,"imgh":253,"title":"Sports leagues slash the price of money for nothing, as NFL remains silent","summary":"Major League Baseball, the NBA, and the PGA want states that adopt gambling to cough up one percent of the action in exchange for, well, nothing.

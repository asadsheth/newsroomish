NFL teams might now have an opportunity to add the Broncos' star to the mix for the upcoming season. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Beal has filed to enter the 2018 NFL Supplemental Draft. The root cause of this decision stems from Beal not accruing enough credits in class to be eligible to play out his senior season with Western Michigan.

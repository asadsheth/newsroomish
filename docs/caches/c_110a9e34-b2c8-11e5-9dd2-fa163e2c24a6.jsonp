At the present moment the only opening on the line that ended the 2018 line is at left guard, the position free agent Luke Joeckel occupied during 2017. There are multiple candidates for the opening already on the roster, including Jordan Roos, Ethan Pocic and Rees Odhiambo, while some have even suggested moving George Fant to right tackle in order to flip Germain Ifedi to left guard.

The Bears put the transition tag on Fuller earlier this month with a one-year salary of $12.9 million. That gives the Bears the right to match any offer Fuller gets, and the Bears have five days to make that decision. The amount of money in the offer sheet Fuller signed with the Packers remains unclear. When the Bears placed the transition tag on Fuller, general manager Ryan Pace said the team was buying time to reach a long-term deal with Fuller.

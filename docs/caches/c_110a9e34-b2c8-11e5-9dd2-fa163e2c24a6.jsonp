and Texans among notables who've reached out to Allen Hurns","summary":"Earlier today, the Jacksonville Jaguars announced the release of wide receiver Allen Hurns to save $7 million in cap space. Not too soon after, Hurns joined 102.5 FM\/610 AM WFNZ of Charlotte, N.C. to talk some football where he revealed that 10 teams had expressed interest in him. Among the notable teams were the Chicago Bears and one of the Jags' divisional rivals, the Houston Texans. If Hurns were to sign with the Bears, of course, that would reunite him with his former partner in crime Allen Robinson, who officially signed with them last Wednesday. As most Jags fans are aware, the two put up crazy figures in 2015 as both eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving and had at least 10 touchdowns.

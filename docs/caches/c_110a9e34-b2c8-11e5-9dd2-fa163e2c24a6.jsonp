But it's unclear if they'll chose to target a pass catcher in free agency, the draft \u2014 or both. A talented receiver hit the open market on Tuesday when the Jaguars released Allen Hurns. Should the Eagles consider signing the 26-year-old wideout? Hurns will have a market for his services. He reportedly already has a meeting with the Cowboys on Wednesday and the Jets are trying to schedule one as well. He's young and he's shown he can produce at a high level when healthy. His best season came in 2015 when he caught 64 passes for 1,031 yards and 10 touchdowns. Hurns will probably come with a hefty price tag.

If Hurns were to sign with the Bears, of course, that would reunite him with his former partner in crime Allen Robinson, who officially signed with them last Wednesday.

The move, long sought by Turkey, comes at a time of strain in bilateral ties over wider Syria policy and over Washington's decision in December to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Turkey has been infuriated by U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, which it views as a terrorist organisation, and has threatened to push its offensive in the Afrin region of northern Syria further east to Manbij, risking confrontation with U.S. troops stationed there.","published_at":1528119837,"content_id":"4f3069d0-e186-3b68-adeb-514b408cf385","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/turkey-u-endorse-roadmap-syrias-manbij-statement-145315421.html","content_published_at":1528134850,"content_time":1528134850,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":0,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ecdd4d22-452a-3f4c-b1fe-7886e69fa9e7","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-50d43140-8c1c-392e-b58e-df1ca78a0b5a_a-ecdd4d22-452a-3f4c-b1fe-7886e69fa9e7","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-50d43140-8c1c-392e-b58e-df1ca78a0b5a_a-ecdd4d22-452a-3f4c-b1fe-7886e69fa9e7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/best-museum-exhibits-usa-summer-5ovkqqt","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Cincinnati.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cincinnati.com\/story\/travel\/destinations\/2018\/06\/04\/museum-exhibits-summer-2018\/666056002\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4mzuFRmathVRSg7LRhmtkA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/n1cGDga9xp_eEeuPg0P7Tw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ecdd4d22-452a-3f4c-b1fe-7886e69fa9e7-181935176.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.GoNxVphJkR7JPooQXjX8Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/n1cGDga9xp_eEeuPg0P7Tw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ecdd4d22-452a-3f4c-b1fe-7886e69fa9e7-181935176.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/n1cGDga9xp_eEeuPg0P7Tw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ecdd4d22-452a-3f4c-b1fe-7886e69fa9e7-181935176.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"The best museum exhibits in the USA for summer 2018","summary":"It's almost summer vacation season and a great time to explore what museums in the U.S. are offering over the warm months.

President Donald Trump, backing the remarks by his Pentagon chief at an international security forum in Singapore, said on Twitter: \"Very surprised that China would be doing this?\" Mattis said the Trump administration's recent decision to disinvite China from a multinational naval exercise this summer was an \"initial response\" to Beijing's island activity.

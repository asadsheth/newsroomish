More than 80% of the office spaces in India do not go for traditional BMS solutions due to excessive cost and tedious maintenance involved in them, and most of those that go for it, use it primarily for managing the HVAC system. Facility Managers everywhere are looking for retrofit, cost-effective, easy to use and easy to maintain solutions in order to address the needs for day to day maintenance of large and often distributed workspaces. To address these pain points, Silvan Innovation Labs (Silvan) has launched its state-of-the-art IoT based Building Manager Platform - It allows enterprises to monitor, control and optimize various parameters in their offices in the most effective manner. \"We had interviewed close to 100 Facility Managers to understand their pain points.","published_at":1528197328,"content_id":"95c06862-d370-38ea-9d16-bca781dbd196","content_url":"https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/news-ani\/silvan-launches-iot-business-manager-for-enterprises-118060500317_1.html","content_published_at":1528174800,"content_time":1528174800,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Internet of Things","vibe_id":"c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"bffb006d-8937-3a5d-b1ad-39ea7a2edecf","post_id":"v-c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724_c-d3db26d8-fe0e-363f-b929-16142ea64861_a-bffb006d-8937-3a5d-b1ad-39ea7a2edecf","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724_c-d3db26d8-fe0e-363f-b929-16142ea64861_a-bffb006d-8937-3a5d-b1ad-39ea7a2edecf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/internet-of-things\/semtech-presents-value-proposition-lora-2bywd4g","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"markets.businessinsider.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/Semtech-Presents-Value-Proposition-of-LoRa-Technology-for-IMC-s-LPWAN-WebinarWebinar-panel-assembles-Internet-of-Things-IoT-leaders-to-discuss-choosing-the-right-LPWAN-solution-for-diverse-set-of-1025975806","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x3ArmUW1q7yu3WmMPccPvQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j1Uq7Zb6.GWEmVCKPwCfuQ--\/dz0zMDA7aD0xNjk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bffb006d-8937-3a5d-b1ad-39ea7a2edecf--714327604.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wi._2t2.d95T1uw_8CXvug--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjk7dz0zMDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j1Uq7Zb6.GWEmVCKPwCfuQ--\/dz0zMDA7aD0xNjk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bffb006d-8937-3a5d-b1ad-39ea7a2edecf--714327604.jpeg","height":169,"width":300,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j1Uq7Zb6.GWEmVCKPwCfuQ--\/dz0zMDA7aD0xNjk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bffb006d-8937-3a5d-b1ad-39ea7a2edecf--714327604.jpeg","imgw":300,"imgh":169,"title":"Semtech Presents Value Proposition of LoRa Technology for IMC's LPWAN WebinarWebinar panel assembles Internet of Things (IoT) leaders to discuss choosing the right LPWAN solution for diverse set of...","summary":"CAMARILLO, Calif., May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq:SMTC), a leading supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms, discusses the value and key benefits of LoRa\u00ae devices and wireless radio frequency technology (LoRa Technology) in the IoT M2M Council (IMC) webinar, \u201cChoosing the Right LPWAN Solution for Your IoT Application,\u201d on June 7 at 8:00 a.m. PT.

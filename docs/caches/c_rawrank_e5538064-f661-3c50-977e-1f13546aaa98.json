Through a process called chemical looping, researchers believe they have found a way to use coal without generating significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). According to Dr. Liang-Shih Fan, distinguished university professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, he and his team have been able to use a process called coal-direct chemical looping to burn coal without emitting pollution.","published_at":1527768536,"content_id":"035848d8-de5d-38a3-a1cb-2a06d8056502","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/brighammccown\/2018\/05\/31\/could-clean-coal-actually-become-a-reality\/","content_published_at":1527742800,"content_time":1527742800,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"259696c2-8337-3548-baef-0e60d92e5cf2","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-27125e31-0bb1-364b-9379-5cbec61d49ff_a-259696c2-8337-3548-baef-0e60d92e5cf2","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-27125e31-0bb1-364b-9379-5cbec61d49ff_a-259696c2-8337-3548-baef-0e60d92e5cf2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/insurers-hard-hit-climate-change-23e1k0z","author":"nanook","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/02\/07\/new-forbes-logo-jpg_213156.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/mikescott\/2018\/05\/31\/insurers-in-the-front-line-of-the-fight-against-climate-change-shoot-themselves-in-the-foot\/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Insurers Will Be Hard-Hit By Climate Change But They're Not Investing In The Low-Carbon Economy","summary":"Flooding will become much more severe as climate change intensifies, increasing payouts by insurers. \u2013 it is having to pay out more to policyholders as extreme weather events such as flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves become more frequent and more severe.

The release of the Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, marks the first reported instance of the EPA issuing tradable credits from previous years into the present market.

The report, submitted to a meeting of the scientific committee of the International Whaling Commission in Slovenia earlier this month, also showed that 53 of the 333 whales slaughtered were juvenile animals. \u201cThe killing of 122 pregnant whales is a shocking statistic and sad indictment on the cruelty of Japan\u2019s whale hunt\u201d, said Alexia Wellbelove, of the Australia branch of Humane Society International. \u201cIt is further demonstration, if needed, of the truly gruesome and unnecessary nature of whaling operations, especially when non-lethal surveys have been shown to be sufficient for scientific needs\u201d, she said. Activists accuse Tokyo of ignoring a ruling in 2014 by the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, that Japan\u2019s whaling was a commercial exercise rather than a scientific research programme and that it had to halt. Japanese whaling vessel the Nisshin Maru returns to the Shimonoseki port in southwestern Japan in this photo taken by Kyodo on March 31, 2017, after it and two other vessels hunted 333 minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean Tokyo, which provides large subsidies to keep its domestic whaling industry afloat, responded by adding new research procedures and resuming operations in 2015 with a quota of 333 minke whales. To protect itself from further legal challenges, Japan also withdrew its recognition of the International Court of Justice as an arbiter of disputes over whales. Whale meat used to be an important source of nutrition for the Japanese but little is consumed by the general public today. Instead, whale meat is served in school meals and a handful of specialist restaurants, with the rest frozen or used as pet food. A spokesman for the environmental group Sea Shepherd said it appeared that the Japanese whaling fleet had been \u201ctargeting pregnant females, for some reason\u201d. Bob Brown, the former head of the Australian Green Party and founder of an environmental foundation, told The Telegraph that the harpooning of pregnant whales was \u201cbarbaric and illegal\u201d. \u201cThese are the most gentle of whales and people go to the Great Barrier Reef just to rub noses with these creatures\u201d, he said. \u201cThen they fall pregnant, go to the Southern Ocean and get harpooned by the Japanese while the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the US and everywhere else sit on their hands and say this criminal behaviour is okay because the Japanese government is funding it. \u201cThe leaders who are today failing to take action have the blood of these innocent whales on their hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an international disgrace and an environmental crime\u201d.","published_at":1527692421,"content_id":"cfc2592a-47ab-3b8d-8d4d-3353d6243469","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/japanese-whaling-programme-slaughtered-122-103550600.html","content_published_at":1527676550,"content_time":1527676550,"content_relative_time":34,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":34,"comment_relative_time":34,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0b940c49-36d0-3d63-83fd-4bc5e4cc59f6","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-780ee402-e67f-3db3-b0d5-d2402d258975_a-0b940c49-36d0-3d63-83fd-4bc5e4cc59f6","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-780ee402-e67f-3db3-b0d5-d2402d258975_a-0b940c49-36d0-3d63-83fd-4bc5e4cc59f6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/buffett-utility-first-u-reach-24fsa9e","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Reuters","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/21\/reuters-85x27_113626.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/buffett-utility-first-u-reach-162951740.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Buffett utility to be first in U.S. to reach 100 pct renewables","summary":"MidAmerican Energy Co will become the first U.S. investor-owned utility to source 100 percent of its customers' electricity needs from renewable energy when it completes a $922 million wind farm in 2020, the company said on Wednesday.

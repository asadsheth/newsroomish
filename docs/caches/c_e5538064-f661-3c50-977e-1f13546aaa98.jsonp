Mike Kachman posted a video to Facebook showing what happened Friday when the shark grabbed onto fellow fisherman Rob Birchmeier's line in Murrells Inlet, S.C. The video shows the shark pulling on the line and dragging Birchmeier's kayak around in the water while Kachman films from his own vessel. Kachman said the shark dragged the kayak around for about 10 minutes before swimming away. \"Sharks feeding hard in the creek meant the red, trout and ladyfish bite was a little slow but we still found a few and had a great time,\" Kachman wrote.","published_at":1527613457,"content_id":"4562c935-e4ef-31df-b542-f19727edbcbe","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Odd_News\/2018\/05\/29\/Shark-drags-fishermans-kayak-around-for-10-minutes\/1151527612583\/","content_published_at":1527613057,"content_time":1527613057,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":26,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"060509f5-5f87-3ecc-b8e0-0b77fe8da34b","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-276cb5f8-4a8e-3f1b-9c49-df6f32f6ecf7_a-060509f5-5f87-3ecc-b8e0-0b77fe8da34b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-276cb5f8-4a8e-3f1b-9c49-df6f32f6ecf7_a-060509f5-5f87-3ecc-b8e0-0b77fe8da34b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/emails-show-climate-skeptic-group-3wqjb8t","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"TheHill","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/energy-environment\/389713-emails-show-climate-skeptic-group-gloated-about-winning-under-trump","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OGpFRZMJohQWoAErN0Z_PQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NM0JMwa8lE47wQXlm43cFg--\/dz05ODA7aD01NTE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_060509f5-5f87-3ecc-b8e0-0b77fe8da34b-1174577770.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NQ6ZNW5vZRHhg2V9mqydMw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTE7dz05ODA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NM0JMwa8lE47wQXlm43cFg--\/dz05ODA7aD01NTE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_060509f5-5f87-3ecc-b8e0-0b77fe8da34b-1174577770.jpeg","height":551,"width":980,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NM0JMwa8lE47wQXlm43cFg--\/dz05ODA7aD01NTE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_060509f5-5f87-3ecc-b8e0-0b77fe8da34b-1174577770.jpeg","imgw":980,"imgh":551,"title":"Emails show climate change skeptics tout 'winning' under Trump","summary":"A conservative think tank\u00a0that seeks to battle\u00a0global warming \"alarmism\" celebrated during President TrumpDonald John TrumpHouse GOP prepares to consider Trump's billion clawback Mexico's president fires back at Trump: We will never pay for your wall Trump in Nashville claims people were 'infiltrating' his campaign MORE's first year in office, according to correspondence obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request.

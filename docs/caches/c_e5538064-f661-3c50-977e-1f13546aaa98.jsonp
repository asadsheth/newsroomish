The annual Clean Energy Ministerial will play host to the new global co-operation plan to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) to clean up the emissions from power plants and factories. The US, Saudi Arabia and Norway are preparing to lead the work to \u00addevelop CCS, and their efforts will be supported by the UK, China, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and the European Commission. It is the first time that governments will come together to work towards \u00adaffordable CCS projects, which the technology\u2019s proponents believe could be a major breakthrough in \u201cdecarbonising\u201d power and industry in a bid to tackle climate change. The Clean Energy Ministerial has brought together ministers from 24 of the world\u2019s largest economies for the past eight years to develop a cleaner energy future. Its past endeavours have included accelerating the drive towards electric vehicles, which has seen a boom in government support and policy commitments as a result. Technology to trap dangerous green house gases could help strip emissions from carbon-intensive industries Credit: Christopher Furlong\/Getty Images For the three lead nations CCS is \u00advital in order to play a role in tackling climate change without undermining important economic drivers. To date CCS projects remain eye wateringly \u00adexpensive. But by taking a diplomatic approach the participating countries hope to set up strategic partnerships to accelerate \u00adinvestment and create a competitive global industry. The major co-operation deal is \u00adexpected to emerge on Thursday, a little over a week after Norway fired the starting gun on its ambitions to \u00adbecome Europe\u2019s leader in developing CCS technology and permanent storage \u00adfacilities under the North Sea. Its \u201cmilestone\u201d investment of almost \u20ac30m (\u00a326m) will help prove the technology at a pair of new demonstration projects at a cement factory and an \u00adenergy-from-waste plant. A full-scale CCS chain traps carbon within factory flues through a chemical reaction and then pipes the emissions away either to be used as an industrial gas or stored in permanent facilities to protect the environment. A full-scale CCS value-chain - C02 storage Norway believes it has the subsea \u00adcapacity to store all of Europe\u2019s carbon emissions, which could prove a lifeline for fossil fuel power generators and manufacturers, which might otherwise be forced to shut to meet government-led climate change targets. The pressing need to clean up carbon-heavy industries has spurred a \u00adrenewed appetite for CCS after a string of early projects fell by the wayside due to cripplingly high costs. The UK Government, which abandoned its own \u00a31bn CCS funding competition in 2015, has put the technology back on the \u00adtable in its clean growth strategy.\u00a0","published_at":1526840483,"content_id":"12c64f62-4efe-3c46-965c-f0cb1e1f1967","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/global-alliance-puts-carbon-capture-171641464.html","content_published_at":1526836601,"content_time":1526836601,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"7145fa17-de5f-3d42-a44f-29b6e686b266","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-e62a07d5-33ef-3c9d-b4b9-f2156c027d62_a-7145fa17-de5f-3d42-a44f-29b6e686b266","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-e62a07d5-33ef-3c9d-b4b9-f2156c027d62_a-7145fa17-de5f-3d42-a44f-29b6e686b266","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/risk-peoples-lives-businesses-few-1w1a2d9","author":"nanook","provider":"NOLA.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.nola.com\/opinions\/index.ssf\/2018\/05\/trump_environment.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QnAPlYFEdtDveXmV9MImsQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ny6TTosOibTa2EtfSeqOEw--\/dz02MjA7aD00MTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7145fa17-de5f-3d42-a44f-29b6e686b266-1723268134.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WidKqXtor.sde9PoiKKjrg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MTM7dz02MjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ny6TTosOibTa2EtfSeqOEw--\/dz02MjA7aD00MTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7145fa17-de5f-3d42-a44f-29b6e686b266-1723268134.jpeg","height":413,"width":620,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ny6TTosOibTa2EtfSeqOEw--\/dz02MjA7aD00MTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7145fa17-de5f-3d42-a44f-29b6e686b266-1723268134.jpeg","imgw":620,"imgh":413,"title":"Who would risk people's lives so businesses can make a few extra dollars?","summary":"The question for this week: What kind of person wants to change laws and regulations so your children are exposed to eating, drinking and breathing more poisons?

First responders said they found the deceased victim with the cougar still standing over the body.

(Reuters) - Thousands of students again walked out of classes across the United States on Friday, marking the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre with a show of unity aimed at pressuring politicians to enact tighter gun restrictions. Students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions planned to leave their classes at 10:00 a.m. local time, organizers said. It was the second student walkout since the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the emergence of a national student movement to end gun violence and toughen restrictions on firearms sales.","published_at":1524214628,"content_id":"7ef7d07a-7073-3c21-a5a6-1e2d85daef6f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/students-walkout-across-united-states-call-gun-reforms-101628214.html","content_published_at":1524243832,"content_time":1524243832,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":22,"vibe_name":"Gun control debate","vibe_id":"2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":0,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04","post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-aa2d98d5-fa4f-3af1-ac67-8fbbb0cc296d_a-6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-aa2d98d5-fa4f-3af1-ac67-8fbbb0cc296d_a-6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/gun-control-debate\/v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-aa2d98d5-fa4f-3af1-ac67-8fbbb0cc296d_a-6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"thestar.com.my","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.thestar.com.my\/news\/world\/2018\/04\/20\/guncontrol-activists-rally-near-columbine-high-school-ahead-of-walkouts\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aJY5KhMpa0dukNZ0N7RrSw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YE_eTiWr2mafcFs9XKcEPQ--\/dz02MjA7aD00MTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04-100854531.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eorfxtkzmJuTApfb5EM3yA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MTM7dz02MjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YE_eTiWr2mafcFs9XKcEPQ--\/dz02MjA7aD00MTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04-100854531.jpeg","height":413,"width":620,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YE_eTiWr2mafcFs9XKcEPQ--\/dz02MjA7aD00MTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6cbb4c73-23be-3f63-9594-96c77302cb04-100854531.jpeg","imgw":620,"imgh":413,"title":"Gun-control activists rally near Columbine High School ahead of walkouts","summary":"Colorado gun control activists rallied on Thursday near Columbine High School, calling for an end to gun violence one day before the 19th anniversary of the massacre there and a planned nationwide student walkout.

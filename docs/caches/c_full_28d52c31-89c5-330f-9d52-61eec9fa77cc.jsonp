Theorists are constantly exploring other options; individual galaxies and their satellites arguably favor some modification of gravity to dark matter; there are big controversies over just how fast the Universe is expanding, and the conclusions we've drawn from supernova data may need to be altered. Given that we've made mistaken assumptions in the past by presuming that the unseen Universe contained substances that simply weren't there, from the aether to phlogiston, isn't it a greater leap-of-faith to assume that 95% of the Universe is some invisible, unseen form of energy than it is to assume there's just a flaw in the law of gravity?

That's because, when it comes to looking for planets,\u00a0light can be the enemy. Starlight tends to\u00a0totally wash out the planets, rendering them effectively invisible. To filter out that light, a team of international researchers\u00a0led by UC Santa Barbara physicist\u00a0Benjamin Mazin\u00a0developed a new tool called the DARK-speckle Near-infrared Energy-resolved Superconducting Spectrophotometer \u2013 A.K.A. DARKNESS (yeah, they probably did that on purpose). It's the largest and most advanced superconducting camera in the world.","published_at":1523994750,"content_id":"69e95070-f635-372e-8538-23d28e1c919c","content_url":"https:\/\/futurism.com\/planets-camera-darkness-telescope\/","content_published_at":1523979962,"content_time":1523979962,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

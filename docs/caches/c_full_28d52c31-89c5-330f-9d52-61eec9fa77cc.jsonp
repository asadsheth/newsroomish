Luckily, the man running the observatory shared Drake's curiosity about (or belief in) extraterrestrial life and gave the go-ahead to his strange endeavor. That was Project Ozma, named for the queen of L. Frank Baum's Oz. It lasted four months, with six hours of listening per day targeting two specific stars\u200a\u2014\u200aTau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani\u200a\u2014\u200aeach about 11 light-years away.

Io, the innermost of Jupiter's largest moons, is about the same size and mass as the moon. It seemed reasonable to predict Io would turn out to be a cold, rocky world studded with craters, too. Instead, Voyager found a world alive with volcanoes. The first plume was spotted by Linda Morabito, an engineer on Voyager's imaging team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as she sorted through the spacecraft's data. The photograph was the first evidence of volcanic activity somewhere besides Earth. Today, Io is known to be the most volcanically active place in the solar system.

In addition to being the closest extra-solar planet to our Solar System, this terrestrial planet also orbits within Proxima Centauri's circumstellar habitable zone (aka. \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d). As a result, scientists have naturally sought to determine if this planet could actually be home to extra-terrestial life. Many of these studies have been focused on whether or not Proxima b could retain an atmosphere and liquid water on its surface in light of the fact that it orbits an M-type (red dwarf) star.

It records the planet with radar systems, radiation detectors, magnetic and gravitational field recorders, and more. But NASA's beautiful new images of Jupiter come from an optical camera called JunoCam. After each perijove, the space agency uploads the raw photo data to its websites.

In honor of the occasion here are five facts about the space shuttle you might not know: In orbit, the space shuttle's top speed was 17,500 miles per hour. At that speed, the astronauts saw a sunset or sunrise about once every 45 minutes. During the total of the shuttle program, which went from 1981 to 2011, the combined mileage of all five orbiters was 513.7 million miles. The space shuttle contained 30,000 heat shielding tiles that were made essentially out of sand.

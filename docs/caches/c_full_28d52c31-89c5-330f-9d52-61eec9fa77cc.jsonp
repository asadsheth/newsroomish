In the new study, researchers used the\u00a0Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Australia Telescope Compact Array to search for AME light in 14 newborn star systems across the Milky Way. They spotted the emissions in three of these systems, coming from the planet-forming disks of dust and gas swirling around the stars.

Over the next several weeks, the orbits of Mars and Earth will grow ever-closer, culminating in a view of the red planet in the evening sky not seen in either brilliance or size since 2003. Back then, the distance between Earth and Mars was only 34.6 million miles, the closest the two planets had come to each other in more than 60,000 years. This summer's flyby, peaking on the morning of July 31, will offer a worthy encore, with backyard telescopes eyeing the red planet's distinctive features from a distance of only 35.8 million miles. \"This Martian pass in July will be almost as good as the ultra-close opposition on 2003,\"","published_at":1528721252,"content_id":"0f4816be-86b0-3731-b800-f51c15371260","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mnn.com\/earth-matters\/space\/blogs\/mars-about-shine-brighter-any-time-2003","content_published_at":1528719720,"content_time":1528719720,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":4,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"12f43ec1-395b-3e98-a1be-4415cd05dc91","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-4e76d932-fc34-3d08-83f2-b0aca9d1a407_a-12f43ec1-395b-3e98-a1be-4415cd05dc91","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-4e76d932-fc34-3d08-83f2-b0aca9d1a407_a-12f43ec1-395b-3e98-a1be-4415cd05dc91","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/universe-lot-more-huge-stars-5lw9h0l","author":"nanook","provider":"Space.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/40841-huge-stars-galaxy-evolution-discovery.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QHbhvm1lnOHQ6ZP84xAw6g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZRAjecfbduesl7OZ6aOvLw--\/dz0xMzc2O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_12f43ec1-395b-3e98-a1be-4415cd05dc91-82054257.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9MDjSLAQiO3yZxW4tY0Psg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTM3Njs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZRAjecfbduesl7OZ6aOvLw--\/dz0xMzc2O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_12f43ec1-395b-3e98-a1be-4415cd05dc91-82054257.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1376,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZRAjecfbduesl7OZ6aOvLw--\/dz0xMzc2O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_12f43ec1-395b-3e98-a1be-4415cd05dc91-82054257.jpeg","imgw":1376,"imgh":1000,"title":"The Universe Has a Lot More Huge Stars Than Scientists Thought","summary":"A surprisingly large number of massive stars have been spotted in regions across the universe, shedding new light on how galaxies near and far evolve, a new study shows.\u00a0 In the study, astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile investigated intense bouts of star formation in four distant, gas-rich starburst galaxies, where new stars are formed 100 or more times faster than they are in our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\u00a0 Massive stars in these galaxies produce outflows of gas and create supernova explosions, which release large amounts of energy and stellar material into space.

To people who live in Earth's northern hemisphere, this marks the longest day of the year. It also signals the end of spring, the arrival of summer, and a gradual retreat toward the fall season, which is marked by an equinox. For those in the southern hemisphere, it's exactly the opposite: The June solstice marks the start of winter, when days have reached their shortest and darkest, though daylight will last longer and grow stronger as the September equinox approaches. Two things drive this all-important seasonal clock: Earth's tilted axis and the planet's orbit around the sun.

The science is abundantly clear on what's happening and why: the Earth is getting warmer, human-caused emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases is the reason, and the concentration of these gases only continues to rise, unabated, over time. While there are a great many calls to reduce emissions, capture carbon, and move away from fossil fuels, there's little that's effectively been done. The Earth continues to warm, sea levels continue to rise, and the global climate continues to change. Could we take a different approach, and partially block the light coming from the Sun?

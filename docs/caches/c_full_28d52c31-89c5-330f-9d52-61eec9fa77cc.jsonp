The cyber-insects, dubbed Marsbees, are the size of bumblebees but have giant wings to generate sufficient lift to hover in the Martian atmosphere, which is around 100 times thinner than Earth\u2019s. Developed by US and Japanese scientists, the bees would be fitted with sensors and wireless communication devices so they could map terrain, take samples, or even look for signs of life, such as methane emissions. Although rovers are already exploring Mars, they move incredibly slowly. Since landing in 2012, Nasa\u2019s Curiosity rover has travelled just 11.2 miles. The Marsbees, would have a mobile base, such as a rover, where they could recharge after they had been deployed. Dr Chang-kwon Kang, of the University of Alabama, said: \u201cMarsbees are robotic flapping wing flyers of a bumblebee size with cicada sized wings. \u201cThey are integrated with sensors and wireless communication devices. The swarm of Marsbees can significantly enhance the Mars exploration mission.\u201d The robot bees would be deployed from a rover, like Nasa's curiosity\u00a0 Credit: University of Alabama\u00a0 The project is one of 25 early stage innovations which have been selected by Nasa from 230 proposals as part of the Space Agency\u2019s \u00a0Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) scheme. All receive a cash boost of around $125,000 from Nasa to fund research for nine months and can then apply to be selected from Phase II funding. \"The NIAC program gives Nasa the opportunity to explore visionary ideas that could transform future Nasa missions by creating radically better or entirely new concepts while engaging America's innovators and entrepreneurs as partners in the journey,\" said Jim Reuter, acting associate administrator of Nasa\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate. \"The concepts can then be evaluated for potential inclusion into our early stage technology portfolio.\" Other schemes selected include a steam powered jumping robot named \u2018Sparrow\u2019 capable of exploring icy ocean world\u2019s such as Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, which many experts believe holds the best chance for finding life in the galaxy. The hopping 'sparrow' steam powered robot Credit: Nasa's JPL Explaining the project, Gareth Meirion-Griffith, of Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that the hopping motion of Sparrow could help even when teams did not know the terrain. \u201cThe employment of a multi-hop architecture allows for the rapid traverse of great distances, enabling a single mission to reach multiple geologic units within a timespan conducive to system survival in a harsh radiation environment. \u201cA propulsive hopping technique allows for complete terrain agnosticism.\u201d Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has also received funding for a shapeshifting robot which would change depnding on whether it was flying in the atmosphere, rolling on a smooth surface, floating on lakes, or exploring caves. The bot, dubbed 'shapeshifter' is a\u00a0\u00a0flying amphibious robot (FAR), comprised of smaller robotic units,\u00a0referred to as\u00a0cobots\u00a0which can break away to carry out independent tasks. Aliakbar Aghamohammadi, project leader, said: \"Shapeshifter can morph into a ball that rolls on the surface, a flight array that can fly & hover above-surface and move in subsurface voids, and a torpedo-like structure to swim under-liquid efficiently \"It morphs into other functional systems to carry out a diverse set of tasks. Examples include transporting large and heavy objects, traversing long distances with minimal power consumption and\u00a0creating communication networks to communicate to surface from deep hard-to-access areas.\" An artist's impression of shapeshifters exploring Kraken Mare on Saturn's moon Titan by self-assembling and into different shapes Credit: Ali Agha, Jose Mendez, JPL The University of Maryland\u00a0also won funding to develop\u00a0a \u2018biobot\u2019, a rover type robot, which would trundle alongside astronauts on lengthy missions, connected by an umbilical cord. to provide them with oxygen, food and water. The companion robot would also be able to carry communications equipment and high-resolution cameras.

A good question, to which I do not have an answer, though I do have an observation. Seeking the thinnest crescent Moon during evening or morning twilight without optical aid has long been a fun and challenging pursuit among amateur astronomers. As early as 1921, Popular Astronomy asked amateur astronomers to \u201ctake up the matter, in order to determine how frequently it may be detected when less than 24 hours.\u201d But I have not encountered any studies on how thin of a crescent the eye can detect with the Sun in the sky.

But according to a new study, to find extraterrestrial life, we may only need to look to our nearest neighbor \u2014 Venus. In a paper published March 30 in the journal Astrobiology, an international team of researchers suggests that the thick and acidic atmosphere of Venus may actually serve as a potential safe haven for microbial life. In the hypothesis paper, they not only present multiple lines of evidence showing the venusian clouds could harbor extreme forms of life, but also show that airborne life on Venus would help explain","published_at":1523482353,"content_id":"02b73ac6-6a87-396a-a299-e92e9f6ade17","content_url":"http:\/\/astronomy.com\/news\/2018\/04\/could-life-be-hiding-in-the-clouds-of-venus","content_published_at":1523430000,"content_time":1523430000,"content_relative_time":34,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":34,"comment_relative_time":34,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d5b52571-05ec-3b62-8797-c4e1b35c5e45","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-c01b2840-242f-3760-80ec-8005087b46ea_a-d5b52571-05ec-3b62-8797-c4e1b35c5e45","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-c01b2840-242f-3760-80ec-8005087b46ea_a-d5b52571-05ec-3b62-8797-c4e1b35c5e45","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/bright-spots-alien-volcanoes-1bx4u4d","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Atlantic","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2018\/04\/io-jupiter-volcano\/557765\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oj5bahQGpOCRxzVnYlKYdw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/t0m4XHHc_o8muo0W2a5kxw--\/dz05NjA7aD01MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d5b52571-05ec-3b62-8797-c4e1b35c5e45--77663317.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tSmIJ9uIq981z3SKQKKpeA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MDA7dz05NjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/t0m4XHHc_o8muo0W2a5kxw--\/dz05NjA7aD01MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d5b52571-05ec-3b62-8797-c4e1b35c5e45--77663317.jpeg","height":500,"width":960,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/t0m4XHHc_o8muo0W2a5kxw--\/dz05NjA7aD01MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d5b52571-05ec-3b62-8797-c4e1b35c5e45--77663317.jpeg","imgw":960,"imgh":500,"title":"These Bright Spots Are Alien Volcanoes","summary":"As Voyager 1 approached Jupiter in the 1970s, scientists expected the spacecraft to find a world not unlike our moon. Io, the innermost of Jupiter's largest moons, is about the same size and mass as the moon. It seemed reasonable to predict Io would turn out to be a cold, rocky world studded with craters, too. Instead, Voyager found a world alive with volcanoes. The first plume was spotted by Linda Morabito, an engineer on Voyager's imaging team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as she sorted through the spacecraft's data. The photograph was the first evidence of volcanic activity somewhere besides Earth. Today, Io is known to be the most volcanically active place in the solar system.

The probe arrived at Mars in late 2003 for a two-year mission , but almost 15 years later it's still operating. ESA said Wednesday four of Mars Express' six gyroscopes \u2014 used to measure the probe's rotation \u2014 are failing, which would end the mission in 2019. So engineers decided to rewrite the spacecraft's computer code so it can orient itself using pictures of surrounding stars most of the time. The code was uploaded last Sunday. A reboot is planned Monday. While similar patches have been developed for other spacecraft, mission manager Patrick","published_at":1523476414,"content_id":"e96b375b-04b3-30a6-a100-b7b60410f531","content_url":"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/business\/technology\/article\/Europe-plans-remote-update-to-keep-aging-Mars-12824743.php","content_published_at":1523426940,"content_time":1523426940,"content_relative_time":35,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":35,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

In a tweet on Friday morning Trump said he was displeased about immigration issues in the bill, even though the White House had given assurances on Thursday that he would sign it. At the White House on Friday, many aides were caught by surprise by the veto threat and had no immediate explanation for what prompted it.","published_at":1521821794,"content_id":"9bc4617a-8056-33a3-b920-4cd288a7c44c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/senate-moves-toward-passage-1-3-trillion-government-043150494--business.html","content_published_at":1521821794,"content_time":1521821794,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":0,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d69750ee-0776-3a7d-bcac-fe1454c07e2a","post_id":"v-ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa_c-26827430-1346-3bb7-a3bb-43508d38bc15_a-d69750ee-0776-3a7d-bcac-fe1454c07e2a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa_c-26827430-1346-3bb7-a3bb-43508d38bc15_a-d69750ee-0776-3a7d-bcac-fe1454c07e2a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/us-news\/v-ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa_c-26827430-1346-3bb7-a3bb-43508d38bc15_a-d69750ee-0776-3a7d-bcac-fe1454c07e2a","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/shooting-reported-maryland-high-school-local-media-124507371.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/enGpj8Pa0gs8oyTUWNEVhg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-142946-1521556827087.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AP3Fmw6sjNyY3YMyE4DeYQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-142946-1521556827087.jpg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-142946-1521556827087.jpg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Two wounded in Maryland school shooting; student gunman dies","summary":"A 17-year-old student opened fire at a Maryland high school on Tuesday, in an attack that left two fellow students wounded, then died after a gunfight with an officer stationed there, amid a renewed debate over gun violence in schools.

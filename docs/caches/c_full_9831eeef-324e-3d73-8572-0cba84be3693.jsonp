replay puts broadcasters in focus again","summary":"It might not have had much of a bearing on the result of the match, but the third umpire might have looked at the wrong replay when the on-field officials turned to him to check on a no-ball during the match between Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore. Jasprit Bumrah is no stranger to bowling no-balls - his costliest one coming in last year's Champions Trophy final - but he got away without scrutiny when he dismissed Umesh Yadav, the eighth Royal Challengers batsman to fall, on Tuesday. The replay shown, though, has Umesh at the non-striker's end, and the heel of Bumrah's front foot lands well inside the crease. \"No need to go [to the third umpire] for that,\" commentator Sunil Gavaskar said on air.","published_at":1524037045,"content_id":"83c3e9ba-4389-3ede-9999-43cf7044d454","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23225830","content_published_at":1524040282,"content_time":1524040282,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

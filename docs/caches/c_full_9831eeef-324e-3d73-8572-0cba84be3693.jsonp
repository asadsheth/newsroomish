India's huge market is a major draw for sponsors and advertisers, who often plan product launches around major cricket events and book advertising slots in advance, which in turn leads to a race between broadcasters to secure content. Star India paid $757.6 million for the rights to broadcast India's home matches for the period July 2012 to March 2018.

Following the pre-season players' draft, the BCB had instructed the clubs to pay the players 25% of their fees before the start of the league, 25% at the end of the league's first phase, and the remaining 50% six weeks after the end of the Super League. By this time, the players should have been paid their dues in full. Tasamul Haque, who played for Kalabagan in the recently concluded 2017-18 season, said the players were forced to inform the BCB since their club had made it clear it wouldn't be paying the squad their dues.","published_at":1526223747,"content_id":"c1948220-8e8d-38ad-9601-6cfe8903748b","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23490237\/unpaid-kalabagan-krira-chakra-players-meet-bcb-ceo-nizamuddin-chowdhury","content_published_at":1526222813,"content_time":1526222813,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"3c574711-d51b-3eda-a0b5-2eb377bcd5e5","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-4c88fb51-93fb-318d-a4f5-00d0495815a6_a-3c574711-d51b-3eda-a0b5-2eb377bcd5e5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-4c88fb51-93fb-318d-a4f5-00d0495815a6_a-3c574711-d51b-3eda-a0b5-2eb377bcd5e5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/big-debate-pakistans-missing-bit-414bqk0","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Cricinfo","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/ci\/content\/story\/1146382.html?CMP=OTC-RSS","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6Z0lhShDA6LIK.xsPqnP6Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.QHxPSZHWFXhuqzWOU7GCg--\/dz05MDA7aD01MDY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3c574711-d51b-3eda-a0b5-2eb377bcd5e5--1564325810.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xk.75l1ZrxfODx3pxIp1iQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MDY7dz05MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.QHxPSZHWFXhuqzWOU7GCg--\/dz05MDA7aD01MDY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3c574711-d51b-3eda-a0b5-2eb377bcd5e5--1564325810.jpeg","height":506,"width":900,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.QHxPSZHWFXhuqzWOU7GCg--\/dz05MDA7aD01MDY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3c574711-d51b-3eda-a0b5-2eb377bcd5e5--1564325810.jpeg","imgw":900,"imgh":506,"title":"The big debate: Pakistan's missing bit of green","summary":"Designers beware: sweaters can lead to board inquiries.

Ansari, also a tournament organising committee member, was suspended from every position he holds in UAE cricket and has 14 days, from May 19, to respond to the charge sheet. ESPNcricinfo understands that he is the same person who had allegedly made a corrupt approach on Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed after the third ODI against Sri Lanka in October last year. The ICC had launched an investigation into the matter and, according to them, Ansari refused to cooperate with the Anti-Corruption Unit.

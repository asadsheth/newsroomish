Group plans are dumping their sickest, most costly enrollees on the individual market. Within that market, health plans are dumping their most costly enrollees on each other. And individuals are dumping costs on other individuals by waiting to insure until they get sick. In each case, the dumping is unfair and inefficient. Even worse, it creates perverse incentives that are causing prices to spiral upward and quality and access to care to spiral downward. What can states do to solve these problems? They can make sure the victims of dumping are fully compensated for their losses.

THE BIG DEAL:\u00a0Congress is struggling to finalize a mammoth funding bill as they\u00a0barrel toward\u00a0a Friday deadline to prevent another government shutdown. Lawmakers say that while they hope to release a funding bill Tuesday night, they are still wrestling with a slate of controversial hurdles -- including border funding and immigration enforcement measures, as well as key ObamaCare payments that are bogged down in an abortion fight. The slog, according to members of leadership, could force Congress to pass a stopgap measure in order to give lawmakers time to finalize the bill and navigate around the Senate's procedural hurdles.","published_at":1521696902,"content_id":"e2578ae9-1a38-3958-a4a0-97d5e4be2098","content_url":"http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/finance\/overnights\/379408-overnight-finance-congress-struggles-to-strike-funding-deal-as","content_published_at":1521583357,"content_time":1521583357,"content_relative_time":49,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":49,"comment_relative_time":49,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5985452c-b084-31b5-9df4-42537b609479","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-20724967-b7a6-3675-9d95-d06d69389341_a-5985452c-b084-31b5-9df4-42537b609479","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-20724967-b7a6-3675-9d95-d06d69389341_a-5985452c-b084-31b5-9df4-42537b609479","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/healthcare-changes-affect-employees-4a2ho5h","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CBS Local","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/philadelphia.cbslocal.com\/2018\/03\/21\/healthcare-changes-affect-employees\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WMVP8guQJlXmeLdeC5ES0g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sYrWy2s1Vd9dyE7dCtxpGQ--\/dz02MjU7aD0zNTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5985452c-b084-31b5-9df4-42537b609479--793203367.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpFz14e5Ws4vsDUvaF_ymg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNTI7dz02MjU7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sYrWy2s1Vd9dyE7dCtxpGQ--\/dz02MjU7aD0zNTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5985452c-b084-31b5-9df4-42537b609479--793203367.jpeg","height":352,"width":625,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sYrWy2s1Vd9dyE7dCtxpGQ--\/dz02MjU7aD0zNTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5985452c-b084-31b5-9df4-42537b609479--793203367.jpeg","imgw":625,"imgh":352,"title":"How Healthcare Changes Will Affect Your Employees","summary":"\u00a0 Moving into 2018, the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) future is uncertain in terms of all its provisions.

Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took away the sometimes hefty up-front cost of long-acting, reversible contraceptives such as implants and intra-uterine devices, more women have been choosing them to prevent pregnancy. Privately insured women have also been using more birth control overall since the ACA contraceptive coverage mandate went into effect in 2013. The mandate requires most private health insurance plans to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods without cost-sharing.

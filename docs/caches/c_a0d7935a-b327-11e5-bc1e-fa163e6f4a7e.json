Many may not remember the tumultuous scenes in Washington, D.C., and around the nation that preceded its passage. Town halls from Iowa to California turned into shouting matches. Signs comparing President Barack Obama to Hitler and Stalin were waved at demonstrations. Angry seniors demanded to \u201ckeep your government hands off my Medicare\u201d in protesting the ACA.

Chris Sununu unveiled a $50 million pledged donation from New Hampshire hospitals to bolster the state's alcohol fund, providing five years of support to boost substance abuse services. Money would be voluntarily donated into the fund by members of the New Hampshire Hospital Association \u2013 31 in total. The new infusion would allow the existing revenue source of the fund \u2013 state liquor sales profits \u2013 to go toward paying New Hampshire's share of the federal Medicaid expansion program. In one fell swoop, Sununu restored funding to the alcohol fund for the first time in 15 years; sidestepped a legal standoff with the federal government over Medicaid expansion funding; tackled a major fiscal concern over the Medicaid expansion bill from New Hampshire fiscal conservatives; and set up a legacy item and talking point ahead of his gubernatorial campaign.","published_at":1523156376,"content_id":"b12a7c12-3225-3aa8-9cec-3929c6fba5b0","content_url":"http:\/\/www.concordmonitor.com\/Capital-Beat-With-Alcohol-Fund-donations-New-Hampshire-governor-Chris-Sununu-cements-a-legacy-item-16694921","content_published_at":1523187280,"content_time":1523187280,"content_relative_time":52,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":52,"comment_relative_time":52,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

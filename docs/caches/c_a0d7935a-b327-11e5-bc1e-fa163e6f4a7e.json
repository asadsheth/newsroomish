New Hampshire's expanded Medicaid program is set to expire if lawmakers don't reauthorize it by December. A Senate bill would continue the program for five years, but change its structure to a managed care model. The program's helped about 50,000 low-income people. Residents surveyed said they'd support a bill similar to one adopted by Kentucky that requires Medicaid recipients to work or go through job training.

Individual market premiums increased 105% in states using healthcare.gov from the year before Obamacare kicked in through the final year of the Obama administration. In particular, we need to be opening up more affordable alternatives to Affordable Care Act health insurance policies, which are becoming increasingly unaffordable for many. In keeping with that direction, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury released a proposal this week to extend the availability of a more affordable, more individualized form of insurance, called short-term limited duration health insurance plans.","published_at":1519466406,"content_id":"e7b00c5b-6a6d-3084-939c-bfde47c219e8","content_url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/23\/opinions\/short-term-health-insurance-opinion-azar\/index.html","content_published_at":1519392517,"content_time":1519392517,"content_relative_time":294,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":294,"comment_relative_time":294,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-dd17afd4-2fb8-31e9-a9fc-b2bfb7b32c0d_a-fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-dd17afd4-2fb8-31e9-a9fc-b2bfb7b32c0d_a-fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-dd17afd4-2fb8-31e9-a9fc-b2bfb7b32c0d_a-fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240","author":"nanook","provider":"CNN","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/23\/politics\/gillibrand-senate-sexual-harassment-bill\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pCMrGn4IIL_suZ938z2YFQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l77dYKCHrzDsJ.Xzj9PmlQ--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240--1312299109.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/299F88GLpKtEhnk8gl65Zg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MTk7dz0xMTAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l77dYKCHrzDsJ.Xzj9PmlQ--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240--1312299109.jpeg","height":619,"width":1100,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l77dYKCHrzDsJ.Xzj9PmlQ--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fcc83b86-73a3-3a1d-887d-dcab599ba240--1312299109.jpeg","imgw":1100,"imgh":619,"title":"Gillibrand urges Senate to take up sexual harassment bill","summary":"(CNN)Nearly one month after the House of Representatives passed sexual harassment legislation to reform the way lawmakers' offices on Capitol Hill handle those cases, Sen.

Be that as it may, after just a few minutes reviewing my employer's healthcare package I couldn't help but feel I would be better off financially going without coverage in the US, at least in the short-term. Paying $256 a month for a high deductible plan means that during the four months or so we have left until hopefully returning to Canada, we will need to spend more than $3,000 on healthcare before most services either my wife or I could possibly need even begin to receive coverage. For insurance to kick in for both of us the family deductible must be met, pushing that number to somewhere just north of $5,000.","published_at":1521960297,"content_id":"926041d4-59b6-30c9-a7b8-7c71913b9ee0","content_url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@craig.axford\/even-after-obamacare-americas-healthcare-system-still-sucks-f1ca8e0afb14","content_published_at":1521817261,"content_time":1521817261,"content_relative_time":152,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":152,"comment_relative_time":152,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-5c1184bf-1808-3176-b4ec-476854adf3be_a-1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-5c1184bf-1808-3176-b4ec-476854adf3be_a-1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/alternatives-buying-cobra-insurance-62wnn0g","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"TheStreet","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/story\/14526128\/1\/alternatives-to-buying-cobra-insurance.html?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8MdwKaiA0NCQPnZtmXUN3Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Ew25mKk.LU8s5RDb2f2xA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee-892197845.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WXcf5TbAdOeJzkCO4d8rxg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDY3O3c9MTYwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Ew25mKk.LU8s5RDb2f2xA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee-892197845.jpeg","height":1067,"width":1600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Ew25mKk.LU8s5RDb2f2xA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fecbf97-da51-3011-96d7-ebfe9a1dfaee-892197845.jpeg","imgw":1600,"imgh":1067,"title":"Alternatives to Buying COBRA Insurance","summary":"Employees who are suddenly faced without the prospect of a job often lean toward purchasing COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act).

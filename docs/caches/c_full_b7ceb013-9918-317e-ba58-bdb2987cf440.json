For instance some malware is programmed to store itself in the system file folder and on removable devices too, like a USB stick Some are designed to replicate themselves in each computer folder. This largely includes ransomware which spreads itself through all folders Some malware also tries to create fake files in different folders so it cannot be found. In the early days of computers, viruses were largely confined to executable data files. An executable file is a file that is used to perform various functions or operations on a computer.

The full findings will be presented at the RSA Conference in April by Dr. Mike McGuire, Senior Lecturer in Criminology at Surrey University, England.

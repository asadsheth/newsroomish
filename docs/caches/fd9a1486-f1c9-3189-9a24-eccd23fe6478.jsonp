It's selling Battlefield 1's Collector's Edition for $13, which sounds like a great deal. And it is, but there's a slight catch: it doesn't come with the game. That could actually be a good thing, since most people who are big enough fans to want the collector's edition would probably already have the game. Also, that makes this edition platform-agnostic, so it doesn't matter whether you do your gaming on PS4, Xbox One, or PC. But if you want to add some Battlefield 1-themed physical goodies to your bookshelf, now's your chance to get it at a big discount.

As usual for Humble Bundles, you can pay what you want for it. That means you can get Dungeon of the Endless, Planetary Annihilation: Titans, and Endless Space - Collection for as little $1. The deal will be available on the Humble Bundle store until April 24. We gave all three of those games at least 7\/10 in our reviews. From our Endless Space review: \"Endless Space is a new game to the 4X strategy scene, featuring non-linear gameplay and a demanding level of difficulty that pushes you to learn from past mistakes and strive to overcome the hurdles of galactic domination. This might not sound like everyone's cup of tea, but","published_at":1523891062,"content_id":"09f918e1-b002-3330-85f0-696e3ebb322d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/pay-what-you-want-for-humbles-newest-strategy-game\/1100-6458160\/","content_published_at":1523865240,"content_time":1523865240,"content_relative_time":38,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-07004abd-6d70-39d6-95fe-06a33c7c3324_a-47def8e2-cf2d-32bd-b957-2f61c37500bf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/no-shame-playing-video-games-5e6fdxo","author":"nanook","provider":"SegmentNext","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/04\/16\/playing-video-games-on-easy-difficulty\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"There Is No Shame In Playing Video Games On Easy Difficulty","summary":"The current generation of video games is well-known for going too easy on the players.

Most of the games facilitate players to clear certain stages with frequent checkpoints and the ability to lower the difficulty down to the level where it starts to feel more like a movie instead of a video game.

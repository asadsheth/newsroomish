First was the Razer Blade Stealth ($1,449.99 at Amazon.com), an ultrathin laptop to compete with the MacBooks ($1,239.00 at Amazon.com) of the world. Now there's the Razer Cynosa Chroma. The Cynosa is technically a\u00a0gaming\u00a0keyboard, but its three best features have little to do with gaming: Spill resistance, how it looks and what it costs.\u00a0 The Cynosa retails for $59 in the US, AU$99 in Australia and \u00a364 in the UK, making it the cheapest Razer keyboard. There's also a Pro version, which lets you add lighting effects under the keyboard itself, for $79, AU$139 and \u00a379.\u00a0","published_at":1513552518,"content_id":"ad06f742-cd47-38f4-b853-56b427ec2c14","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/products\/razer-cynosa-chroma\/preview\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a36fa7a04d301122d922fa2&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","content_published_at":1513512022,"content_time":1513512022,"content_relative_time":32,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-6ab1e042-1782-3174-a7f0-72c14142f243_a-1e1f4379-977f-31c8-b707-23533c29cb4f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/greatest-video-games-2017-1m48yyb","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"CNET","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/pictures\/here-are-the-greatest-video-games-of-2017\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a36e30804d30169e49be67b&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pY93ky90LNyK4kMTxrTUdA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mDtrhg79DlYBWAzUtwwS5w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1e1f4379-977f-31c8-b707-23533c29cb4f--1271472524.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YM9YhxvBbvmnqdOKNwbW9Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mDtrhg79DlYBWAzUtwwS5w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1e1f4379-977f-31c8-b707-23533c29cb4f--1271472524.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mDtrhg79DlYBWAzUtwwS5w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1e1f4379-977f-31c8-b707-23533c29cb4f--1271472524.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Here are the greatest video games of 2017","summary":"CNET tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol.","published_at":1513546513,"content_id":"1e1f4379-977f-31c8-b707-23533c29cb4f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/pictures\/here-are-the-greatest-video-games-of-2017\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a36e30804d30169e49be67b&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","content_published_at":1513512000,"content_time":1513512000,"content_relative_time":32,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b48c7192-8df0-3d75-9b52-2de03f3c0186_a-5b1e2b02-d565-392e-b0a1-5ca8d2e5d7c5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/7-best-free-iphone-games-week-1x9no9w","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":null,"lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/7-best-free-iphone-games-week-184333649.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jgNoNm0fp.EfNqz5.HKRoQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/BGR_News\/free-ios-games-dec-14-2017.jpg?quality=98&strip=all","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yaWy.PBJLLa5fhKdcAcjUw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02OTY7dz0xMTc2Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/BGR_News\/free-ios-games-dec-14-2017.jpg?quality=98&strip=all","height":696,"width":1176,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/BGR_News\/free-ios-games-dec-14-2017.jpg?quality=98&strip=all","imgw":1176,"imgh":696,"title":"The 7 best free iPhone games of the week","summary":"As the holiday season is finally in full swing, many of you are probably traveling, preparing to travel or back at home with very little to do.

The sequel offers many more open-world activities than its predecessor did, it fixes the original game's confusing plot, and it substitutes Patrol Missions with two new activities \u2014 Adventures and Lost Sectors. Adventures are picked up from beacons scattered throughout four different destinations you can explore, while Lost Sectors are essentially missions for looting and exploring. The main objective is to do your part to save the solar system and defeat Dominus Ghaul, the leader of the Red Legion.

Cereal sales have been soft, and Kellogg Co. has tried to reach out to those in their 20s and 30s before, such as in ads pitching cereal as a late-night snack. The new store is filled with stuff it thinks millennials like: There's a vending machine that dispenses cans of La Croix sparkling water. And a few feet away is a well-lit shelf where customers can place their bowls of cereal, add props such as vintage Kellogg trays and take pictures to post on Instagram.

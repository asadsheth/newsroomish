Teachers are waiting for state lawmakers to agree on a pay raise, and the state House and Senate haven't scheduled a meeting to resolve their differences. Many teachers said they'd rather be in the classroom. But they say they believe they've come too far to back down. \"We feel like we're under attack constantly,\" said Cody Thompson, a social studies and civics teacher at Elkins High School. \"Eventually whenever you're pushed into a corner, you've got to push back.\" That leaves West Virginia's parents anxiously trying to fill their children's idle hours","published_at":1520240750,"content_id":"7f796f77-9da9-338c-ba0a-a6e920069810","content_url":"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/news\/education\/article\/West-Virginia-Waiting-game-video-games-as-12727966.php","content_published_at":1520228100,"content_time":1520228100,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-1940ecb1-c1ba-3257-bca1-a19d8b76824c_a-544f3e69-3a1a-351c-ba75-8b6c4589bceb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/breach-review-chess-meets-starship-3o5jprw","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"PCWorld","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3260205\/gaming\/into-the-breach-review.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LMyhepHD2JT0HXRBDyfOmA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ijED_fVs_R4hUw5uE6yRuQ--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_544f3e69-3a1a-351c-ba75-8b6c4589bceb-859596953.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YRFb9N_FQ3ZwOnYyYM1.Ww--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00Njc7dz03MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ijED_fVs_R4hUw5uE6yRuQ--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_544f3e69-3a1a-351c-ba75-8b6c4589bceb-859596953.jpeg","height":467,"width":700,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ijED_fVs_R4hUw5uE6yRuQ--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_544f3e69-3a1a-351c-ba75-8b6c4589bceb-859596953.jpeg","imgw":700,"imgh":467,"title":"Into the Breach review: Chess meets Starship Troopers in brilliant, bite-sized battles","summary":"The Rusting Hulks\u2014not exactly the most inspiring name for humanity's saviors.

Usually, the hacker group called CPY is the one who comes with cracks for games using Denuvo DRM, however, in the case of Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition, Chinese crack group, 3DM, is the one to crack it. Furthermore, the game being cracked might have nothing to do with the Denuvo at all, as the group itself noted that they used the \u201c.exe\u201d file from the game's recently released playable demo on Steam and unlocked the full Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition from the unencrypted pre-load files downloaded through Origin. It seems to be a clever workaround rather than a full-fledged crack for the game and Square Enix might fix this, however, the game has already been uploaded to torrent sites.","published_at":1520235634,"content_id":"4a3b4d6e-fb30-3505-8295-139fbee57ad8","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/05\/final-fantasy-15-windows-edition-cracked\/","content_published_at":1520235228,"content_time":1520235228,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-ccd85c4b-936d-3806-ba5d-a8bb7d3b04c3_a-d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/student-health-services-holding-video-5d3ex6w","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Daily Gamecock","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailygamecock.com\/article\/2018\/03\/video-games-mental-health","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HUTxHMdjmOYTvpPeyySFvw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c2Q4RhLBb3WpwqOBvtDmnA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NDI0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94--107530839.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6WP1XXcT6b.3aBtNWU9EMg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjQ7dz0xMDAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c2Q4RhLBb3WpwqOBvtDmnA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NDI0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94--107530839.jpeg","height":424,"width":1000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c2Q4RhLBb3WpwqOBvtDmnA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NDI0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94--107530839.jpeg","imgw":1000,"imgh":424,"title":"Student Health Services holding video game and mental health convention","summary":"When the average person thinks about video games, his or her mind may go in many directions, with the majority of them involving explosions, mushroom-based power-ups or plasma grenades.

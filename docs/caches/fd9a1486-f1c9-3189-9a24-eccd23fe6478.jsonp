BoofinBernstein, Tuesday. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa,\" Corey exclaimed into his headset's microphone to his teammate who uses the handle JohnnyCheesecake. \"Wow.\" Of the 100 players in this duo round of the free online survival game Fortnite, BoofinBernstein and JohnnyCheesecake just became the 95th and 96th to die; good enough for fifth place. \"If I was back at home, I'd just keep playing until I won,\" Corey said. Corey lives in San Diego. We met him in his girlfriend's Rutgers dorm room, to which he brought both his Xbox and his headset from across the country to aid his online Fortnite squad during this week of vacation. \"I'm pretty","published_at":1519861850,"content_id":"dac30efe-b43f-3e9b-86f6-24af3f16c0ee","content_url":"http:\/\/www.fox5ny.com\/news\/fortnite-online-game","content_published_at":1519861260,"content_time":1519861260,"content_relative_time":43,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-5798301a-9f4c-33fa-885c-81f5203a8fec_a-ca674496-8b09-3beb-9bf4-17aa33b06270","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/webxr-api-opens-door-breed-5jlklf6","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"VentureBeat","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/?p=2328792","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eey5JCkKnhJfMR72vn0L7Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oK52fw0FwGzL3Gk_Nc8vRw--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTA4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ca674496-8b09-3beb-9bf4-17aa33b06270-21566809.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JFnvn9Stqmi5kqNgwFcz8Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oK52fw0FwGzL3Gk_Nc8vRw--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTA4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ca674496-8b09-3beb-9bf4-17aa33b06270-21566809.jpeg","height":1080,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oK52fw0FwGzL3Gk_Nc8vRw--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTA4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ca674496-8b09-3beb-9bf4-17aa33b06270-21566809.jpeg","imgw":1920,"imgh":1080,"title":"The WebXR API opens the door to a new breed of cross-reality games","summary":"Last May I pointed to WebVR games as one of the VR industry's biggest potential sweet spots for generating widespread traction because the combination of VR, games, and the open web represents a giant industry intersection. The web is unparalleled in its capacity to get VR games in front of end users, and get them playing, since it bypasses so much of the friction that otherwise serves as one of the chief headaches for the industry: distribution. There's also WebVR's forthcoming seismic upgrade to the WebXR API, which will soon allow developers to create mixed reality content that is responsive across the full spectrum of immersive computing devices. The implications this opens up are profound insofar as it expands the potential reach for any single piece of content that developers ship, and in the context of games it means that any player with virtually any gadget or gear will now be able to play, wherever they are and on their own terms.","published_at":1519861610,"content_id":"ca674496-8b09-3beb-9bf4-17aa33b06270","content_url":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/?p=2328792","content_published_at":1519861525,"content_time":1519861525,"content_relative_time":43,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c91ddfc6-5721-3a8b-af81-414da9d6e580_a-7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/war-stories-brad-wardell-poor-413osqm","author":"third_watch","provider":"Ars Technica","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gaming\/2018\/02\/war-stories-brad-wardell-remembers-the-mystery-error-that-killed-elemental\/?comments=1&post=34897989","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mFxDVB_DQRkN3TYsKKxZFQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J.zlHgbUC7oZpkS9aKiGWA--\/dz03NjA7aD0zODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7--1860944956.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7VFCyZMdazEKJSa3yWhP5A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODA7dz03NjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J.zlHgbUC7oZpkS9aKiGWA--\/dz03NjA7aD0zODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7--1860944956.jpeg","height":380,"width":760,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J.zlHgbUC7oZpkS9aKiGWA--\/dz03NjA7aD0zODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7--1860944956.jpeg","imgw":760,"imgh":380,"title":"War Stories: Brad Wardell on how poor memory management crippled Elemental","summary":"Welcome back to \"War Stories,\" our ongoing video series looking at game devs tackling complex programming challenges.

Addiction can lead to health issues, school problems, money troubles, crime and even death.","published_at":1519768277,"content_id":"db20b01e-b14a-32c4-9280-34153ac8081e","content_url":"http:\/\/community.today.com\/parentingteam\/post\/is-your-child-addicted-to-video-games","content_published_at":1519759103,"content_time":1519759103,"content_relative_time":72,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-f805fd7c-a66a-30c6-ab0d-631a91046ca9_a-8422ad4e-59ef-34fc-84d4-66cb3521fcb2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/metacritic-crowns-bethesda-top-publisher-63aqgzw","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"TechSpot","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/static.techspot.com\/news\/73459-metacritic-crowns-bethesda-top-publisher-2017.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Metacritic crowns Bethesda its top publisher of 2017","summary":"Everyone has a favorite video game publisher, but if you want to know who comes out on top based on their Metacritic scores, the aggregate site has you covered.

The game was previously advertised as a Windows Store exclusive, fitting considering that it's part of Xbox's Xbox One Play Anywhere titles, but that exclusivity may not be entirely true. As part of the Xbox One Play Anywhere program, State of Decay 2 would be able to be played on both the Xbox One and the PC without having to worry about starting over on either version, as your progress would be carried over between the two. The previous State of Decay game came out on Steam originally alongside the Xbox 360 version, so Undead Labs might be going for a sense of continuity with the prospect of State of Decay 2, if we're actually getting it.","published_at":1523910614,"content_id":"d812ee37-67fb-353f-8cea-57b1245bc322","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/04\/17\/we-may-be-seeing-state-of-decay-2-on-steam-possibly-not-windows-store-exclusive\/","content_published_at":1523910029,"content_time":1523910029,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b2828b43-dcde-3a9c-8188-3f431b80183d_a-bc0ab32d-96e0-383b-aa65-3dd48571f342","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/terrarias-spiritual-successor-terraria-otherworld-ocym6u6","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"TechSpot","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.techspot.com\/news\/74177-terrari-spiritual-successor-terraria-otherworld-has-officially-cancelled.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Terraria's spiritual successor, \"Terraria: Otherworld,\" has officially been cancelled","summary":"Terraria may have started as a 2D Minecraft clone but the game has evolved to be far more than that over time.

Also available are the adventure game Tales from the Borderlands: A Telltale Game Series, the nostalgia-heavy RPG Kingsway, and Tokyo 42, a stealth-action game set in futuristic Japan. Last but not least is DubWars, which pairs Dubstep electronic music with top-down shooting.

dedicated telescopes equipped with highly sensitive superconducting cameras operating at the South Pole, the high Chilean Atacama plateau, and possibly northern hemisphere sites, will provide a dramatic leap forward in our understanding of the fundamental nature of space and time and the evolution of the Universe. CMB-S4 will be designed to cross critical thresholds in testing inflation, determining the number and masses of the neutrinos, constraining possible new light relic particles, providing precise constraints on the nature of dark energy, and testing general relativity on large scales. The first goal and requirement for CMB-S4 is to measure the imprint of primordial gravitational waves on the CMB polarization anisotropy, quantified by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. The r requirements have been translated into measurement requirements consistent with projecting out foregrounds and other contamination.","published_at":1521465031,"content_id":"d4b5e677-62f9-3058-bf12-9e9de3f04b69","content_url":"https:\/\/www.nextbigfuture.com\/2018\/03\/ground-based-superconducting-cameras-and-telescopes-for-measure-cmb-with-100-times-more-sensitivity.html","content_published_at":1521440043,"content_time":1521440043,"content_relative_time":34,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":34,"comment_relative_time":34,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-aa273178-3210-3add-919f-5c27fce96c7c_a-6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-aa273178-3210-3add-919f-5c27fce96c7c_a-6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-aa273178-3210-3add-919f-5c27fce96c7c_a-6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","author":"third_watch","provider":"Washington Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/obituaries\/stephen-hawking-physicist-who-came-to-symbolize-the-power-of-the-human-mind-dies-at-76\/2018\/03\/14\/d4298e14-273a-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.882d0416624c&utm_term=.b5ab3e257316&tid=ss_tw","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Stephen Hawking, physicist who came to symbolize the power of the human mind, dies at 76","summary":"Stephen W.

Colleagues have revealed the renowned theoretical physicist\u2019s final academic work was to set out the groundbreaking mathematics needed for a spacecraft to find traces of multiple big bangs. Currently being reviewed by a leading scientific journal, the paper, named A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation, may turn out to be Hawking\u2019s most important scientific legacy. The new paper is a bid to clear up an issue thrown up by Hawking's 1983 \"no-boundaries\" theory Credit: Barcroft Images Fellow researchers have said that if the evidence which the new theory promises had been discovered before Hawking died last week, it may have secured the Nobel Prize which had eluded him for so long. The new paper seeks to resolve an issue thrown up by Hawking\u2019s 1983 \u201cno-boundary\u201d theory which described how the universe burst into existence with the big bang. According to that account, the universe instantaneously expanded from a tiny point into a prototype of what we live in today, a process known as inflation. But the theory also predicted an infinite number of big bangs, each creating their own universe, a \u201cmultiverse\u201d, which presented a mathematical paradox because it is seemingly impossible to measure. Read more | Professor Stephen Hawking Carlos Frenk, professor of cosmology at Durham University, told The Sunday Times: The intriguing idea in Hawking\u2019s paper is that [the multiverse] left its imprint on the background radiation permeating our universe and we could measure it with a detector on a spaceship. \u201cThese ideas offer the breathtaking prospect of finding evidence for the existence of other universe.\u201d Professor Thomas Hertog, from KU Leuven University in Belgium, worked with Hawking on the new theory and said he met the Cambridge scientist two weeks ago to discuss its final approval. \u201cThis was Stephen: to boldly go where Star Trek fears to tread,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has often been nominated for the Nobel and should have won it. Now he never can.\u201d In quotes | Stephen Hawking Despite the hopeful promise of Hawking\u2019s final work, it also comes with the depressing prediction that, ultimately, the universe will fade into blackness as stars simply run out of energy. He died last Wednesday in Cambridge at the age of 76, having suffered from a rare form of motor neurone disease since 1964. He eventually became confined to a wheelchair and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication. His most famous popular, A Brief History of Time, was published in 1988 and sold more than 10 million copies within 20 years.","published_at":1521458357,"content_id":"e61231a8-9e3a-32cf-8027-65ecef7169fa","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/stephen-hawking-leaves-behind-apos-172703588.html","content_published_at":1521394023,"content_time":1521394023,"content_relative_time":47,"reaction_count":6,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":47,"comment_relative_time":47,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9ce1ac81-748f-3e09-82bb-1568b26c44e3","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-92d51dca-3269-3e6e-a588-f5690b47054a_a-9ce1ac81-748f-3e09-82bb-1568b26c44e3","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

Here's how to do it","summary":"There's a never-before-studied aurora gracing night skies around the world, and NASA wants you to try to spot it. The newfound aurora, named Steve (short for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), looks like a purple light with some green features.\u00a0 Scientists think that Steve likely appears when charged plasma from the sun hits the Earth's magnetic field in a certain way, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances. \u00a0 SEE ALSO: 'Steve' is the name of a new kind of aurora, discovered thanks to citizen scientists Citizen scientists helped discover Steve, but more observations in the future could help researchers figure out exactly how and when it forms.\u00a0 So, what's the deal with Steve, and how can you spot it in the night sky?\u00a0 The particularly unique thing about Steve is that it looks somewhat like a line instead of the more typical oval you get with traditional auroras. It can also be seen from space, according to NASA.\u00a0 \"This is a light display that we can observe over thousands of kilometers from the ground,\u201d NASA scientist Liz MacDonald said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cIt corresponds to something happening way out in space. Gathering more data points on STEVE will help us understand more about its behavior and its influence on space weather.\u201d The more observations of Steve the better, as far as NASA is concerned. By spotting the mysterious type of aurora, scientists should hopefully be able to piece together exactly how it works and why it appears every now and then. If you want to try to spot the special aurora in person, NASA has a some tips for you: Be sure to document all your Steve sightings with Aurorasaurus, the organization that first started gathering observations of it.\u00a0 Auroras are created when charged particles shot out by the sun slam into Earth's magnetic field, warping it.\u00a0 Some of those charged particles make it through the magnetic field, slamming into the upper atmosphere and interacting with neutral particles, creating the glow that we see as the northern or southern lights.\u00a0 For the most part, the auroras can only be seen in the high latitudes, not far from the poles due to magnetic field lines, but when a solar storm is particularly intense, the oval of the aurora can reach down farther, bringing the special lights to people who usually can't see them.

There is a link between that story and when bird species defend their \u201cyard\u201d against intruding neighbors. Why, at certain times, do female birds find certain males of the same species irresistible? Why do some male birds help build nests, incubate eggs and stick around even after the moms have left?

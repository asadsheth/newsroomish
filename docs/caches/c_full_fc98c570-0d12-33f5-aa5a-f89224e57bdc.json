The vast cosmic objects are born when huge clouds of dust and gas collapse under the weight of their own gravity. Hundreds of billions of stars flicker on, and eventually planets also condense from rings of dust surrounding many of those stars. Now, a series of newly-processed photos from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a map of star formation in 50 galaxies located within 60 million light-years of Earth. SEE ALSO: Researchers spot colliding galaxies interacting in the early universe Scientists used the Hubble to photograph these galaxies in ultraviolet light, revealing bursts of star formation within them, producing a catalogue that reveals 39 million hot, blue stars and 8,000 star clusters, according to NASA. The spiral galaxy Messier 96 about 35 million light-years away.Image: NASA, ESA, and the LEGUS team\"There has never before been a star cluster and a stellar catalog that included observations in ultraviolet light,\" survey leader Daniela Calzetti said in a NASA statement. The survey is called LEGUS, short for Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey. \"Ultraviolet light is a major tracer of the youngest and hottest star populations, which astronomers need to derive the ages of stars and get a complete stellar history,\" Calzetti said.\u00a0 The ultraviolet catalogue shows off some truly remarkable visions of the star forming galaxies not all that far away from our own.\u00a0 A photo of Messier 66, for example, reveals the details of the spiral galaxy's arms standing out in stark relief against Messier 66's glowing center. The spiral galaxy Messier 66.Image: NASA, ESA, and the LEGUS teamBut these photos are more than beautiful.\u00a0 They could also help to answer some serious scientific mysteries surrounding how galaxies themselves form. \"By seeing galaxies in very fine detail \u2014 the star clusters \u2014 while also showing the connection to the larger structures, we are trying to identify the physical parameters underlying this ordering of stellar populations within galaxies,\" Calzetti said in the statement.\u00a0 \"Getting the final link between gas and star formation is key for understanding galaxy evolution.\" Astronomers have used the Hubble Space Telescope to look at star formation among galaxies in our own cosmic backyard.Image: NASA, ESA, and D. Calzetti (University of Massachusetts)Scientists also hope to use the LEGUS catalogue to help inform research done in the future by the James Webb Space Telescope, the infrared space observatory that will be Hubble's successor when it launches in 2020.\u00a0 The telescope is expected to help piece together more information about how galaxy clusters evolve in galaxies over time.\u00a0 \"Much of the light we get from the universe comes from stars, and yet we still don't understand many aspects of how stars form,\" team member Elena Sabbi, said in the statement.\u00a0 \"This is even key to our existence \u2014 we know life wouldn't be here if we didn\u2019t have a star around.\" WATCH: Scientists found a weird galaxy without dark matter","published_at":1526667893,"content_id":"a66f1fda-5abc-3f0a-a9c3-c499c1fec6d8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/hubble-telescope-creates-awe-inspiring-104000200.html","content_published_at":1526640000,"content_time":1526640000,"content_relative_time":8,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":8,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b20202be-ada9-3e73-9fe0-e3ee85793a18","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e2238c46-d6ff-30ac-88a9-1b3df70d0b0f_a-b20202be-ada9-3e73-9fe0-e3ee85793a18","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e2238c46-d6ff-30ac-88a9-1b3df70d0b0f_a-b20202be-ada9-3e73-9fe0-e3ee85793a18","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/energy-202-why-climate-scientists-5kxmmt3","author":"third_watch","provider":"Washington Post","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/powerpost\/paloma\/the-energy-202\/2018\/05\/18\/the-energy-202-why-climate-scientists-want-to-be-thought-of-as-the-real-climate-skeptics\/5afded6330fb042588799589\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lczYsS0Civ4l2w4ZS3q8jA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Wj1gpo7GjAx3J9l5To51Tg--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTQ4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b20202be-ada9-3e73-9fe0-e3ee85793a18-1691292026.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jNVLxExnjaXaknmtH8L16w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD05NDg7dz0xNDg0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Wj1gpo7GjAx3J9l5To51Tg--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTQ4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b20202be-ada9-3e73-9fe0-e3ee85793a18-1691292026.jpeg","height":948,"width":1484,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Wj1gpo7GjAx3J9l5To51Tg--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTQ4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b20202be-ada9-3e73-9fe0-e3ee85793a18-1691292026.jpeg","imgw":1484,"imgh":948,"title":"The Energy 202: Why climate scientists want to be thought of as the real\u00a0'climate skeptics'","summary":"THE LIGHTBULB Last week, I wrote a story about how the staff of Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt turned to\u00a0advocates outside the agency to help craft a\u00a0\u201cred team-blue team\u201d exercise.

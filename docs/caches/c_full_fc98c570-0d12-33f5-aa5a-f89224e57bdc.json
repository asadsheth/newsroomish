According to new data from the\u00a0Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)\u00a0system, which was installed aboard the International Space Station last June, these two stars revolve around each other once every 38 minutes \u2014 the fastest orbit ever observed in a\u00a0pulsar binary system\u00a0like this. Of the two stars, one is an X-ray pulsar, which is a superdense neutron star that shoots out X-rays as it spins, researchers said in a new study describing the finding. Pulsars form when massive stars explode in a supernova blast, leaving behind a whirling stellar core.

Virgo, the Maiden, currently covers much of the southern sky during the late-evening hours. Examining the star pattern's scattering of mostly faint stars, ancient skywatchers envisioned the Greek Earth goddess Demeter, and Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of fertility. Come to think of it, however, Virgo has been identified with practically every goddess who has been related in any way to Earth. For instance, Virgo also represents Astraea, the Greek goddess of justice.

PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi, which is downwind to Punjab and Haryana, show a coherent increase \u2014 rising often from as low as 50 micrograms per cubic metres (\u00b5g\/ m3) before the onset of the burning season to 300\u00b5g\/m3 at the beginning of November when burning is under way. During the crop burning season of 2016, the seven-day average peaked to a record high of 550\u00b5g\/m3. This could also explain the severe smog episode in November 2016 when PM2.5 concentration peaked to more than 700\u00b5g\/","published_at":1526186657,"content_id":"b0240456-dfab-3314-ac4e-2ad3d91bc9d8","content_url":"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/environment\/pollution\/pm2-5-levels-rising-in-proportion-to-stubble-burning-finds-nasa-study\/articleshow\/64144045.cms","content_published_at":1526171400,"content_time":1526171400,"content_relative_time":40,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":40,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b597203d-71c6-3677-998d-a9d6c14dbb74_a-6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b597203d-71c6-3677-998d-a9d6c14dbb74_a-6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/robocrop-earth-rover-farmer-never-dc1d3qm","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Mail Online","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-5722407\/Robocrop-Earth-Rover-farmer-never-stops-working-come-rain-shine.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/91mBYv3c1mmcY2zXUgLY1A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FBigQFHjldKdkl_nLDTJog--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec--138562948.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6hl4jjbTNvOCsaMa7gHPfw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODI7dz02MzY7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FBigQFHjldKdkl_nLDTJog--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec--138562948.jpeg","height":382,"width":636,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FBigQFHjldKdkl_nLDTJog--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec--138562948.jpeg","imgw":636,"imgh":382,"title":"Earth Rover 'farmer' who never stops working come rain or shine","summary":"It can zap weeds with lasers, harvest crops without complaint and perhaps even dig farmers out of a Brexit-sized hole. Hailed as the potential saviour of the British farming industry, Earth Rover is a robot device designed by the scientists responsible for a ground breaking Mars Rover project. Thanks to cutting-edge optical imaging and 3D camera technology, Earth Rover prototypes have successfully monitored individual crops, spotting diseases and determining when they are ready to be picked. The Rover, which is around a year away from being rolled out to British farms, will also be equipped with lasers to destroy weeds and intelligent plant recognition technology to avoid singeing valuable crops.","published_at":1526171064,"content_id":"6d9b1757-8a09-3611-af04-4ae25350d1ec","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-5722407\/Robocrop-Earth-Rover-farmer-never-stops-working-come-rain-shine.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","content_published_at":1526170858,"content_time":1526170858,"content_relative_time":40,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":40,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

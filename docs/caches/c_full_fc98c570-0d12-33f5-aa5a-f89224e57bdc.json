Archaeologists at the University of Aberdeen made the remarkable finds at Burghead on Scotland's northern Moray coast. The fort, which was once used by the ancient Pictish people, is described as the largest of its kind in Scotland. The fort was burned to the ground in the 10th century, likely by advancing Vikings. Experts say that this has preserved items that would have otherwise rotted away hundreds of years ago. Excavations at the site began in 2015.

By contrast, another antidepressant, Zoloft (sertraline), worked under these conditions. The results of tests with the four drugs \u2013 all of which fall in the class of antidepressants known as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013 are published in the May online edition of Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior.","published_at":1527761116,"content_id":"0abd6c93-e261-32f4-b02b-a4f02e9ade98","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-05-common-antidepressents-effective-high-altitudes.html","content_published_at":1527760285,"content_time":1527760285,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a19be0d9-45d3-3c91-9cb1-9317ccc5903b","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-12777bf4-c83e-3159-a978-067a745641d1_a-a19be0d9-45d3-3c91-9cb1-9317ccc5903b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-12777bf4-c83e-3159-a978-067a745641d1_a-a19be0d9-45d3-3c91-9cb1-9317ccc5903b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/china-building-brand-space-station-5ako9fb","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"markets.businessinsider.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/china-building-a-new-space-station-2018-5-1025888254","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/42ZFtDNPxIrZaWof.aqX6g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xxcUeQLu5TtsJx426eVOrw--\/dz0yMDAwO2g9MTM1MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a19be0d9-45d3-3c91-9cb1-9317ccc5903b--1359223109.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qkR2G1XkMmMNIHjPG6MFsw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMzUxO3c9MjAwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xxcUeQLu5TtsJx426eVOrw--\/dz0yMDAwO2g9MTM1MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a19be0d9-45d3-3c91-9cb1-9317ccc5903b--1359223109.jpeg","height":1351,"width":2000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xxcUeQLu5TtsJx426eVOrw--\/dz0yMDAwO2g9MTM1MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a19be0d9-45d3-3c91-9cb1-9317ccc5903b--1359223109.jpeg","imgw":2000,"imgh":1351,"title":"China is building a brand-new space station, and it may be the latest move in a new space race","summary":"China is building a new space station, and officials say the whole world is invited to participate.

While SpaceX's ultimate goal of colonizing Mars will take decades to reach, if at all, the company has definitely achieved a series of significant milestones since it was founded in 2002. Over recent years, though, SpaceX has done well to dominate the space launch services sector \u2013 offering to launch commercial (and occasionally military) satellites at a much lower price than incumbents while largely remaining profitable. This has shaken up the industry status quo and forced incumbents like Arianespace and United Launch Alliance (a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin) to work on similar low-cost launch systems.","published_at":1527709067,"content_id":"2a2fe560-406f-35dc-9fb8-307d82664a57","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/greatspeculations\/2018\/05\/30\/whats-driving-spacexs-sky-high-valuation\/","content_published_at":1527708900,"content_time":1527708900,"content_relative_time":42,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":42,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

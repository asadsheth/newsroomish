Instead, Voyager found a world alive with volcanoes. The first plume was spotted by Linda Morabito, an engineer on Voyager's imaging team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as she sorted through the spacecraft's data. The photograph was the first evidence of volcanic activity somewhere besides Earth. Today, Io is known to be the most volcanically active place in the solar system.

We see time travel in plenty of movies, such as the Terminator and Back to the Future franchises. There are even those among us who believe certain people to be time travelers. As of today, we have no proof that there are, in fact, time travelers among us. All the time travelers we know are from the silver screen. What we do have today are theories about how time travel may be possible and how it would work. 10 Einstein's Theory Of General Relativity The first theory on this list is Einstein's theory of general relativity.[1] This theory helped physicists theorize about how time travel could exist.

It records the planet with radar systems, radiation detectors, magnetic and gravitational field recorders, and more. But NASA's beautiful new images of Jupiter come from an optical camera called JunoCam. After each perijove, the space agency uploads the raw photo data to its websites.

At that speed, the astronauts saw a sunset or sunrise about once every 45 minutes. During the total of the shuttle program, which went from 1981 to 2011, the combined mileage of all five orbiters was 513.7 million miles. The space shuttle contained 30,000 heat shielding tiles that were made essentially out of sand.

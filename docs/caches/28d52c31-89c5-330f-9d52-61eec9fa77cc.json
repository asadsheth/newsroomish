Gagarin's 108-minute foray into space, which beat the United States' own effort by three weeks, made him a Russian hero even after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Here is a recap of his life, which ended on March 27, 1968. - Humble beginnings - Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934, in the rural village of Klushino, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) west of Moscow, to parents who worked on a Soviet socialist-style collective farm.

One day while Orion was swimming in the ocean, Apollo found his sister and pointed to Orion, who appeared as just a little dark speck way out at sea. He bet Artemis she couldn't hit such a small target. And so she shot the far-off target with an arrow, not realizing it was Orion's head. But Orion was a","published_at":1521870357,"content_id":"18d5be7b-c823-312f-bafc-59eb788c5764","content_url":"http:\/\/news.wqcs.org\/post\/fri-mar-23-2018-moon-orio","content_published_at":1521781200,"content_time":1521781200,"content_relative_time":88,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-b9edaf3d-65a4-3ffb-872b-3f7ce53e27c7_a-cb5bd45c-82ef-3f4f-ba72-ec3f9a27477a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/looking-planet-nine-astronomers-gaze-4psc4fa","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Scientific American","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/looking-for-planet-nine-astronomers-gaze-into-the-abyss\/?wt.mc=SA_Twitter-Share","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DfdZEDAR4favOB5BfLAOLQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3oDinmrM8nEkAXobJMecFw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cb5bd45c-82ef-3f4f-ba72-ec3f9a27477a-1451477045.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gtotBkHcFKbmltN7.c2maw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMzU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3oDinmrM8nEkAXobJMecFw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cb5bd45c-82ef-3f4f-ba72-ec3f9a27477a-1451477045.jpeg","height":335,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3oDinmrM8nEkAXobJMecFw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cb5bd45c-82ef-3f4f-ba72-ec3f9a27477a-1451477045.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":335,"title":"Looking for Planet Nine, Astronomers Gaze into the Abyss","summary":"It's been just over two years since Caltech astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin made an explosive claim: Based on the orbital motion of objects in the Kuiper Belt\u2014a region beyond Neptune that is home to Pluto and other icy bodies\u2014there must be a very big something much farther out, hidden save for its subtle gravitational tugs on the rest of the solar system. Brown and Batygin's best models put this mysterious object at about 10 times Earth's mass, perhaps 20 times more distant from the sun than Neptune and currently drifting through what might be a 20,000-year orbit in a patch of sky near the constellation Orion. Brown and Batygin called it \u201cPlanet Nine,\u201d elevating it to the position once held by Pluto (which was demoted to \u201cdwarf planet\u201d status in 2006, when Brown discovered multiple Pluto-like worlds out past Neptune).","published_at":1521862713,"content_id":"cb5bd45c-82ef-3f4f-ba72-ec3f9a27477a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/looking-for-planet-nine-astronomers-gaze-into-the-abyss\/?wt.mc=SA_Twitter-Share","content_published_at":1521694800,"content_time":1521694800,"content_relative_time":112,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

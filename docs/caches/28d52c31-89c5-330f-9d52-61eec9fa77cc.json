The gracious folks of the Physics Department at Miami University, my alma mater, invited me to deliver the annual memorial lecture for the department, the George C. Benson Memorial Lecture. The lecture honors its namesake, George Benson, who was a very well liked postdoc at Miami in physics. He was killed tragically in a plane crash in early 1967. One of the highlights of the trip was having a dinner before the lecture with members of the Benson family, who were wonderfully interesting and kind.\u00a0 My talk, \u201cThe New Cosmos: Astronomy's Ongoing Revolution,\u201d took place on Thursday","published_at":1524076119,"content_id":"306e926a-a790-3ad8-bbd5-ae7dd8a093bc","content_url":"http:\/\/cs.astronomy.com\/asy\/b\/daves-universe\/archive\/2018\/04\/18\/david-eicher-delivers-benson-lecture-at-miami-university.aspx","content_published_at":1524034800,"content_time":1524034800,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-02f3e79b-7841-3478-b1a9-6dbf1f27f9f5_a-5671c402-0c3d-3db7-b5e1-68f59aae5492","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/study-explains-solar-system-smash-5nev4j7","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Popular Mechanics","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/space\/moon-mars\/a19846296\/mars-moons-study-phobos-deimos\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gF4Y6DyxhJ9uiD7c71jZSg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.LiQ.Qs7i2voH7e7jGfTfA--\/dz03NTg7aD0zNzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5671c402-0c3d-3db7-b5e1-68f59aae5492-96121186.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cS5d15.vGqA7J3U.VDiiRA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzk7dz03NTg7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.LiQ.Qs7i2voH7e7jGfTfA--\/dz03NTg7aD0zNzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5671c402-0c3d-3db7-b5e1-68f59aae5492-96121186.jpeg","height":379,"width":758,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.LiQ.Qs7i2voH7e7jGfTfA--\/dz03NTg7aD0zNzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5671c402-0c3d-3db7-b5e1-68f59aae5492-96121186.jpeg","imgw":758,"imgh":379,"title":"New Study Explains the Solar System Smash-Up That Created Mars' Two Moons","summary":"Mars' moons may be a chip off the old block\u2014and the Red Planet could have had a lot more than two of them.

Theorists are constantly exploring other options; individual galaxies and their satellites arguably favor some modification of gravity to dark matter; there are big controversies over just how fast the Universe is expanding, and the conclusions we've drawn from supernova data may need to be altered. Given that we've made mistaken assumptions in the past by presuming that the unseen Universe contained substances that simply weren't there, from the aether to phlogiston, isn't it a greater leap-of-faith to assume that 95% of the Universe is some invisible, unseen form of energy than it is to assume there's just a flaw in the law of gravity?

A new look at data collected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has revealed tentative signs of charged particles from the fourth of these largest moons, Callisto. So far, only two potential footprints have been spotted, but they pave the way for locating more footprints that could reveal insight into the giant planet's magnetic field. As Jupiter's rotating magnetic field sweeps past the planet's four large moons, called the Galilean moons, energy travels down the field lines connecting them to the planet.

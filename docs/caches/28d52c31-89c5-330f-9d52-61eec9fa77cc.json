In her new book, \"Catching Stardust\" (Science\/Space, 2018), Starkey aims to reach everyone from scientists to science enthusiasts and explain what makes asteroids and comets so strange and remarkable and why it's so important to study them. Often confused for one another, comets and asteroids have been misunderstood for centuries. But comets aren't just dirty snowballs\u00a0and, as Starkey explained in her book, we now know that asteroids can look just as much like comets as comets","published_at":1528237323,"content_id":"4f103f71-a6f2-3df9-a45b-ec514cde95d6","content_url":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/40728-asteroid-mining-comet-landing-new-book.html","content_published_at":1528236060,"content_time":1528236060,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-545c9e31-8c01-33f8-a9fd-bb46126a9969_a-ec048b36-be89-3304-9279-3b09e4281c16","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/catching-stardust-comprehensive-exploration-comets-3fm0kxk","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Space.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/40767-catching-stardust-exploration-comets-asteroids.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/T2iC3TrByGhhqVh_h_pKGw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0q4ojKqolPh9Y4El24YRTA--\/dz0xNTk5O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ec048b36-be89-3304-9279-3b09e4281c16--1938602777.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.s5ndRO4hJDBfqizWUigmQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTU5OTs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0q4ojKqolPh9Y4El24YRTA--\/dz0xNTk5O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ec048b36-be89-3304-9279-3b09e4281c16--1938602777.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1599,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0q4ojKqolPh9Y4El24YRTA--\/dz0xNTk5O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ec048b36-be89-3304-9279-3b09e4281c16--1938602777.jpeg","imgw":1599,"imgh":1000,"title":"Catching Stardust: A Comprehensive Exploration of Comets and Asteroids","summary":"Natalie Starkey\u00a0has been actively involved in space science research for more than 10 years.

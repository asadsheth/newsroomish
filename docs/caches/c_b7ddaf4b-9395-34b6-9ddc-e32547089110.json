The Royal family More than 50 Members of the Royal family were invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011, which gives us a clue as to how many will be attending the younger prince's nuptials this year.. The first royal name to be confirmed was of course\u00a0Prince William, who will be Prince Harry's best man. Harry was his brother's best man in 2011; however the decision means the Duke of Cambridge, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final happening on the same day. While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will both be there, with their older children Prince George and Princess Charlotte confirmed as pageboy and bridesmaid, the newborn Louis will stay away from the public eye.\u00a0Prince Louis, who will be less than a month old by the time of the wedding, is likely to be cared for by a nanny close by.

The bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren.\u00a0The pageboys\u00a0are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.

According to tabloid reports, he has snubbed his cousin Lady Amelia Windsor, not inviting her to the wedding at all. Bat Woman @bulgariofficial Festa \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd A post shared by Mel Windsor (@amelwindsor) on May 13, 2018 at 6:13am PDT The 22-year-old student and fashion model is 32nd in line to the throne. A friend told The Sun:\u00a0\u201cThey were a little surprised not to be invited as they were looking forward to going. \u201cAmelia is creating quite a name for herself with her modelling and Instagram posts. \u201cPerhaps Harry just wanted to keep the family invited to a small number or maybe he didn\u2019t want anyone upstaging the bride.\u201d Members of the public Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave. Invitees will be made up of 100 pupils from two local schools, The Royal School and St George's School, as well as representatives from Prince Harry\u2019s key charities\u00a0and members of the public from all over the UK who have served their communities.\u00a0They include: Philip Gillespie Philip Gillespie Credit: Michael Cooper\/PA Philip, 30, from Ballymena\u00a0lost his right leg in an IED incident in Afghanistan and now raises funds and awareness for ABF The Soldiers' Charity.

Amelia, who was given a pair of tickets, asked her mother to forfeit her chance to attend and instead let the second ticket go to Sharon Goodman. Mrs Goodman\u2019s 15-year-old granddaughter, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, was killed in the terror attack last year. The couple will also invite 530 members of staff from the Royal Household and Crown Estate\u00a0and more than 600 people from the Windsor Castle community. Meghan and Wallis: Two American divorc\u00e9es marrying into royalty - what a difference 80 years makes Who won't be going? Among the royals not invited are Lady Amelia Windsor and her sister, Marina;\u00a0Gabriella and Frederick Windsor;\u00a0 Lady Davina Lewis and Gary Lewi; and\u00a0Lady Helen Taylor and Timothy Taylor. It has been confirmed that American president Donald Trump has not been invited to the wedding.\u00a0When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married in 2011,\u00a0Commonwealth and European political figures\u00a0were present but the then-President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle were not invited. However, as Meghan is the first American to marry into the Royal family since 1937,\u00a0many wondered if Trump would be invited. Yet on April 10, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said: \"It has been decided that an official list of political leaders \u2013 both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.\" In the past Trump has made unfavourable remarks about Harry's mother, Diana,\u00a0telling\u00a0Howard Stern in 2000 he would have \"slept with Princess Diana without hesitation\"\u00a0before adding \"She was crazy but you know these are minor details\".\u00a0 He also\u00a0publicly commented that\u00a0the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry\u2019s sister-in-law, was\u00a0\"stupid\" after she was\u00a0photographed topless\u00a0in France\u00a0in 2012. Theresa May will also not be attending the wedding, despite her predecessor David Cameron attending the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011. Because of Prince Harry and Barack Obama's burgeoning friendship \u2013\u00a0the royal interviewing the former president for Radio 4's Today programme at the end of 2017 \u2013\u00a0there were suggestions that Obama would be on the royal guest list.

When asked at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on April 19 he said: \"I, of course, wish them the very best. But I have important responsibilities elsewhere.\" The invitations Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor.\u00a0\u00a0 Royal sources have said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George\u2019s Chapel is relatively small\u00a0and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession. Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.

They read: \"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales K.G., K.T. requests the pleasure of the company of \u2026 at the Marriage of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales with Ms Meghan Markle at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday 19th May 2018 at 12 Noon followed by a reception at Windsor Castle.\" Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.\u00a0\u00a0 The rules guests must follow As well a dress code, guests have reportedly been sent meticulously detailed instructions for the big day. The seven pages of 'critical guidance',\u00a0according to the\u00a0Mail on Sunday,\u00a0ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to \"surrender mobile telephones and any devices used for image capture\". \u00a0The instructions further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: \"No swords.\" Two driving routes have been suggested\u00a0with guests required to meet at the\u00a0Windsor Farm Shop, founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce. There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification before being ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle.\u00a0 The guidance, the newspaper reports, states: \"It should be noted that gifts cannot be brought to St George's Chapel or the Reception that follows at Windsor Castle.\" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u00a0have asked instead for guests who wish to give gifts to donate to seven chosen charities to honour their big day.\u00a0","published_at":1526616005,"content_id":"fb02aa60-1f3e-3d74-91f9-969243023579","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/royal-wedding-guest-list-full-063600976.html","content_published_at":1526654426,"content_time":1526654426,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":4,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d860936e-ee21-34eb-a437-38fdf5193fc1","post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-1242dae4-3aac-3f4b-ac5c-5d88a0966c2e_a-d860936e-ee21-34eb-a437-38fdf5193fc1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

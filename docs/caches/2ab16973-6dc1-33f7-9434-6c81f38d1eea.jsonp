Do you anticipate that this will replace full-motion simulators in the near future? \u2014 submitted via email Answer: Flight training technology is expanding constantly. Simulators today are very realistic and are a form of virtual reality already. This trend is likely to continue. There is a longstanding debate regarding the need for motion in simulators. I have flown both full-motion and chair-movement simulators. So far, I prefer the full-motion simulators due to the greater fidelity. I would not expect full-motion simulators to be replaced in the near future.

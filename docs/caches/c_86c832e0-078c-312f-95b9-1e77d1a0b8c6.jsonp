enough to open up about his mental health. In a message discussed in a March 6 blog post by the Star Tribune's Michael Rand, Love described exactly what an anxiety attack feels like and the shame one feels having a terrible illness that no one can see. He is helping to make depression and anxiety not such a taboo topic. Every person who shares such a story will make it easier for people to talk about mental illnesses, and we can only hope that someday the stigma and discrimination will disappear. It is difficult to live with these illnesses, but feeling like you need to hide away in isolation is by far worse.","published_at":1520499793,"content_id":"5dfa16e0-8d46-34ac-ac50-825b9696fd81","content_url":"http:\/\/www.startribune.com\/readers-write-attention-to-mental-health-feminism-and-abortion-fashion-and-sexualization-guns\/476182023\/","content_published_at":1520464860,"content_time":1520464860,"content_relative_time":333,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Feminism","vibe_id":"86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":333,"comment_relative_time":333,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"99badac5-4722-342d-8efb-1c2f903580bc","post_id":"v-86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6_c-e8bb6820-de6f-329e-98d6-4d90a7e0371b_a-99badac5-4722-342d-8efb-1c2f903580bc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6_c-e8bb6820-de6f-329e-98d6-4d90a7e0371b_a-99badac5-4722-342d-8efb-1c2f903580bc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/feminism\/china-retailers-cash-she-economy-3l3i14y","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/china-retailers-cash-she-economy-070104382.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"In China, retailers cash in on \"she\" economy for Women's Day","summary":"Chinese retailers are cashing in on International Women's Day, offering coupons and discounts on sportswear, cosmetics and healthcare to get women to spend more, dubbing the day \"Queens' Day\" and \"Goddesses' Day\".

Journalism and access to education for women were banned under the regime. In the 16 years since the fall of the Taliban, women have gradually moved back into important societal and professional roles. Yet the knock-on effect of a country marred by war and conflict continues to be felt across important public-facing sectors \u2014 including journalism. The number of female journalists has been declining in recent years, particularly in the last two, according to a survey released by the Centre of Afghan Women Journalists in November. The report found that 1,037 women work in media outlets.

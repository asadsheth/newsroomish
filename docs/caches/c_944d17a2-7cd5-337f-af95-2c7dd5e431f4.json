The lift is in response to crews from the Bureau of Indian Affairs Navajo Region Wildland Fire and Aviation Management responding to reports of fires that were\u00a0not wildfires. Johnson Benallie, assistant fire management officer for BIA Wildland Fire and Aviation Management, said in the release that earlier in the month crews responded to nine reports about smoke and, since there was no documentation to demonstrate these were not wildfires, crews were busy for that day.","published_at":1521638025,"content_id":"6de84b16-2978-3400-bdee-7f303320dce7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.daily-times.com\/story\/news\/local\/navajo-nation\/2018\/03\/21\/fire-restriction-partially-lifted-navajo-nation\/440285002\/","content_published_at":1521606600,"content_time":1521606600,"content_relative_time":42,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":42,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f61985a2-ada5-3a0e-8601-71e52165826f","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-df470fa7-3ad5-3874-ae23-09957e5ba78e_a-f61985a2-ada5-3a0e-8601-71e52165826f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-df470fa7-3ad5-3874-ae23-09957e5ba78e_a-f61985a2-ada5-3a0e-8601-71e52165826f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/portuguese-officials-rebuked-report-deadly-1tm4bwo","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Washington Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/europe\/portuguese-officials-rebuked-in-report-on-deadly-wildfires\/2018\/03\/21\/6281ab90-2cfb-11e8-8dc9-3b51e028b845_story.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N85glaMCPFoqrdaMDq..FA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9ZQum8vjQx2rHTWCS_ijrQ--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9Nzc5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b089ff2f-17c8-3020-9196-450d4f3c2a1b--1279597796.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AQmXU3Egm9rjW3HVjx6zqQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Nzk7dz0xNDg0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9ZQum8vjQx2rHTWCS_ijrQ--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9Nzc5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b089ff2f-17c8-3020-9196-450d4f3c2a1b--1279597796.jpeg","height":779,"width":1484,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9ZQum8vjQx2rHTWCS_ijrQ--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9Nzc5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b089ff2f-17c8-3020-9196-450d4f3c2a1b--1279597796.jpeg","imgw":1484,"imgh":779,"title":"Portuguese officials rebuked in report on deadly wildfires","summary":"LISBON, Portugal \u2014 Portugal's government said Wednesday it was taking new steps to prevent wildfires, as a report into a three-day spate of blazes last October that killed 48 people said authorities should have been better prepared.

firefighters face a 9-percent increase in cancer diagnoses and a 14-percent increase in cancer-related deaths, compared to the general population in the United States. To fight these statistics, the East Montgomery County Fire Department recently installed its first of two Chemical Detox Infrared Saunas which work to reduce cancer risks associated with firefighters.

Authorities said Sunday that officers are closing off the highway between Whitmore and Helemano and motorists will have to take a detour on Kaukonahua Road. Firefighters are working to contain the fire, which is burning in a vacant, open area. However, drivers heading to Oahu's North Shore should expect to encounter heavy traffic. Police could not say how long the road closure would remain in place.","published_at":1520806371,"content_id":"81742289-0bbd-3380-aa0b-0b4e2964b58c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/nation-world\/brush-fire-shuts-down-stretch-of-kamehameha-highway\/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all","content_published_at":1520798874,"content_time":1520798874,"content_relative_time":267,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":267,"comment_relative_time":267,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e8ebe8be-ad25-3878-a3dc-77b6a76b775f","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-f866f3b6-c089-30a6-9353-ce7b7d116068_a-e8ebe8be-ad25-3878-a3dc-77b6a76b775f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-f866f3b6-c089-30a6-9353-ce7b7d116068_a-e8ebe8be-ad25-3878-a3dc-77b6a76b775f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/method-predict-where-lightning-spark-2ng974d","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"BayToday.ca","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.baytoday.ca\/national\/new-method-can-predict-where-lightning-will-spark-wildfires-calgary-study-859777","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5VyqlTSRyTGxXfHQQaC.KA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/__rPR.WrJoN4cvr.1sFJVQ--\/dz02MzA7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e8ebe8be-ad25-3878-a3dc-77b6a76b775f-944709798.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yZNR7QEp0nFDnZafYZG4vw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjA7dz02MzA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/__rPR.WrJoN4cvr.1sFJVQ--\/dz02MzA7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e8ebe8be-ad25-3878-a3dc-77b6a76b775f-944709798.jpeg","height":420,"width":630,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/__rPR.WrJoN4cvr.1sFJVQ--\/dz02MzA7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e8ebe8be-ad25-3878-a3dc-77b6a76b775f-944709798.jpeg","imgw":630,"imgh":420,"title":"New method can predict where lightning will spark wildfires: Calgary study","summary":"CALGARY \u2014 Apparently lightning can strike the same place twice\u00a0after all.

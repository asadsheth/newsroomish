The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Knoxville, names Michael Reed, who lost his wife and two daughters to the fire, along with James England, who lost his home on Greystone Heights Road, as lead plaintiffs and seeks\u00a0class-action status for all victims of the deadly 2016 Gatlinburg wildfire. Attorney Sidney Gilreath said he expects the number of claims could top 300 people. The park's fire management officer, Greg Salansky, and \"park senior leadership were not only unprepared but unqualified to manage the fire,\" failed to notify Gatlinburg firefighters and police in time, and bear direct responsibility for the 14 deaths and more than $1 billion in property damage caused by the Nov. 28, 2016, fire, Gilreath wrote in the lawsuit.","published_at":1527187251,"content_id":"b90ee91c-2cd3-37ad-92d8-df35456fc3e3","content_url":"https:\/\/www.tennessean.com\/story\/news\/local\/tennessee\/gatlinburg\/2018\/05\/24\/lawsuit-filed-gatlinburg-fire-victims-seeks-class-action-relief\/634903002\/","content_published_at":1527186816,"content_time":1527186816,"content_relative_time":263,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":263,"comment_relative_time":263,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0873da9f-a9a1-3833-8f76-c8e13483a3ab","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-eaf854db-18c4-3aba-9da6-faaa7c94faa1_a-0873da9f-a9a1-3833-8f76-c8e13483a3ab","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-eaf854db-18c4-3aba-9da6-faaa7c94faa1_a-0873da9f-a9a1-3833-8f76-c8e13483a3ab","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/forest-fire-spreads-agricultural-fields-14eabui","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"hindustantimes.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/dehradun\/forest-fire-spreads-to-agricultural-fields-six-girls-receive-burns\/story-pJqi4nIYTlJ6Rl0cd2pNsL.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/e4Uj6L2zOlF0gFJVt75glg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/idgEk_uKdKesA4BMYiEH1Q--\/dz05NjA7aD02NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0873da9f-a9a1-3833-8f76-c8e13483a3ab-324465364.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JdMSgisK4ZIbXSSP4hplPQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NDA7dz05NjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/idgEk_uKdKesA4BMYiEH1Q--\/dz05NjA7aD02NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0873da9f-a9a1-3833-8f76-c8e13483a3ab-324465364.jpeg","height":640,"width":960,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/idgEk_uKdKesA4BMYiEH1Q--\/dz05NjA7aD02NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0873da9f-a9a1-3833-8f76-c8e13483a3ab-324465364.jpeg","imgw":960,"imgh":640,"title":"Forest fire spreads to agricultural fields, six girls receive burns","summary":"Sixteen-year-old Shivani of Pattra village in Uttarkashi district did not know that her routine walk to home after school would give her scars for a lifetime.

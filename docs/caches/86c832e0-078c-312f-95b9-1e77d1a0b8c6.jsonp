Naomi Parker Fraley, who is believed to be the inspiration behind the wartime poster, died at the age of 96 on Saturday, BBC News reported Jan. 23rd. The Rosie the Riveter image was created by Pittsburgh-based artist J. Howard Miller and researchers believe that he based the poster on a photograph of a woman factory worker that was widely published in magazines in 1943. Another woman, Geraldine Doyle, originally came forward saying she was the woman in the photograph and received plaudits when she died in December 2010. Since then, James Kimble, a professor at Seton Hall University, uncovered evidence identifying Parker Fraley as the person in the image.","published_at":1517298944,"content_id":"f004b225-c502-3a34-8942-14a042673ab6","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/01\/29\/this-is-what-rosie-the-riveter-would-earn-today\/","content_published_at":1517262458,"content_time":1517262458,"content_relative_time":93,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Feminism","vibe_id":"86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6_c-fd722665-2a96-398c-9c06-f3e674949e8c_a-9a59a195-7edb-3859-ab8a-d7118aa1ee12","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/feminism\/metoo-inexplicably-turned-older-feminists-66daheq","author":"nanook","provider":"Dallas News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/opinion\/commentary\/2018\/01\/26\/metoo-inexplicably-turned-older-feminists-villains","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Xv9JM7VG48J6JMRlmRnTw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O5ySaO5o67SyYHZwjssW5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9a59a195-7edb-3859-ab8a-d7118aa1ee12--1503911670.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7z9vpIagckaISqQo.xykcw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O5ySaO5o67SyYHZwjssW5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9a59a195-7edb-3859-ab8a-d7118aa1ee12--1503911670.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O5ySaO5o67SyYHZwjssW5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9a59a195-7edb-3859-ab8a-d7118aa1ee12--1503911670.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"How #MeToo inexplicably turned older feminists into villains","summary":"Putting aside the debate over who is a feminist, do you feel like, broadly speaking, you've noticed generational differences in the way people who are older versus younger write and think about those things?

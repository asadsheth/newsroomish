But 60 percent of those same parents are at least \"somewhat concerned\" about negative health effects, the group found. \"The truth is, when it comes to VR and kids, we just don't know that much,\" wrote Jeremy Bailenson, the director of Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab and a co-author of the report,\u00a0titled Virtual Reality 101:","published_at":1522901582,"content_id":"ced593eb-f4bc-3cd7-a8aa-f5dc1e305baf","content_url":"http:\/\/blogs.edweek.org\/edweek\/DigitalEducation\/2018\/04\/virtual_reality_and_children_common_sense_media_survey.html","content_published_at":1522818000,"content_time":1522818000,"content_relative_time":59,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":59,"comment_relative_time":59,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2a12bb48-077e-337f-93ab-ee0b509a8906","post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-17e02eeb-f526-3e25-bfee-281ed597bf9f_a-2a12bb48-077e-337f-93ab-ee0b509a8906","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-17e02eeb-f526-3e25-bfee-281ed597bf9f_a-2a12bb48-077e-337f-93ab-ee0b509a8906","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/virtual-reality-driving-simulator-shows-3rx4b9n","author":"third_watch","provider":"10NEWS","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.wtsp.com\/article\/news\/local\/virtual-reality-driving-simulator-shows-dangers-of-distracted-driving\/67-534512315","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/y.1VziyEzMbOhhjrdVdxNw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ru5Uuk5SyDr0AxAaENYLWg--\/dz03NTA7aD00MjI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2a12bb48-077e-337f-93ab-ee0b509a8906--170436808.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/L5IKzj03M7SUWMjpOPiShg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjI7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ru5Uuk5SyDr0AxAaENYLWg--\/dz03NTA7aD00MjI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2a12bb48-077e-337f-93ab-ee0b509a8906--170436808.jpeg","height":422,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ru5Uuk5SyDr0AxAaENYLWg--\/dz03NTA7aD00MjI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2a12bb48-077e-337f-93ab-ee0b509a8906--170436808.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":422,"title":"Virtual reality driving simulator shows dangers of distracted driving","summary":"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - More than 40,000 people were killed in car accidents in 2017. Distracted driving was a major contributor to the figure. April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month. This united effort is to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving and reduce preventable deaths. The Arrive Alive Tour is doing its part by traveling the East Coast with a virtual reality simulator that gives people a first-hand look at the dangers of distracted driving. Virtual reality goggles and Bluetooth sensors turn a driver's seat into a controller for a virtual word. A safety ambassador can then add distractions to the game to simulate drunk driving, or texting and driving.

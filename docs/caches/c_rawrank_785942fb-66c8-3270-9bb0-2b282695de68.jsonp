The 52-year-old, who until now didn't know the identity of the person who performed CPR on him that day, met his mystery lifesaver while appearing on the\u00a0The Dr Oz Show on Wednesday. Harper was speaking about his near fatal heart attack during his appearance on the show when Dr Oz mentioned he had managed to track down the young doctor named Phillip. 'There was a doctor in the gym. My coach, my friends, they were all there but I did not know about this other person that was performing CPR on me,' Harper said in a clip for the show set to air Wednesday afternoon.","published_at":1523467791,"content_id":"76e0de38-0f48-33e5-a943-9b9d95e7b324","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-5604379\/Bob-Harper-meets-doctor-saved-life-heart-attack.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","content_published_at":1523467677,"content_time":1523467677,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"TV buzz","vibe_id":"785942fb-66c8-3270-9bb0-2b282695de68","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

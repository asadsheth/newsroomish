The fate of the Boeing 777 has mystified investigators ever since it went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014. However, a panel of experts assembled for the Australian TV programme 60 Minutes says the evidence suggests Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah executed a careful series of manoeuvres to evade detection and ensure the plane disappeared in a remote location. Martin Dolan, former head of the Australia Transport Safety Bureau, who led the two-year search for the missing plane, said: \u201cThis was planned, this was deliberate, and it was done over an extended period of time.\u201d The plane was presumed to have flown on autopilot before running out of fuel and plunging into the southern Indian Ocean. However, the wreckage has never been found and the search was suspended in January last year. Zaharie Amad Shah was the captain of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 when it disappeared in 2014 The panel suggested a more gradual descent could mean the search was concentrated in the wrong area and that the plane could still be found largely intact. Simon Hardy, a Boeing 777 instructor, said Captain Zaharie avoided detection by flying a careful course along the winding border between Malaysian and Thai air space, crossing in and out of radar cover on either side. \u201cSo both of the controllers aren\u2019t bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, it's gone. It\u2019s not in our space any more,\u2019\u201d he told the programme, which was broadcast on Sunday. The search for MH370 \u201cIf you were commissioning me to do this operation and try and make a 777 disappear, I would do exactly the same thing.\u201d He also pointed out the Malaysian captain had made an unexplained turn to fly over his home town of Penang. \u201cSomebody was looking out the window, It might be a long, emotional goodbye or a short, emotional goodbye to his home town,\u201d he said. Survey ship HMS Echo and a Lockheed P-3 Orion during the early days of the search in the southern Indian Ocean Credit: Press Association Larry Vance, a veteran air crash investigator, told the programme the public could be confident in a growing consensus about the plane\u2019s final moments and that the pilot was intent on killing himself. \u201cUnfortunately, he was killing everybody else on board, and he did it deliberately,\u201d he added. The pilot Theories about the plane's disappearance being due to a \u201crogue pilot\u201d emerged soon after the tragedy. Malaysian officials said they believed the plane went missing after\u00a0a \u201cdeliberate act\u201d and confirmed the last words heard from the cockpit were \"good night Malaysian three seven zero\". It\u2019s unknown whether the sentence was spoken by Captain Zaharie or the co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid. However no conclusive evidence has ever been found that one or both of the pilots\u00a0deliberately steered the aircraft into the ocean. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane\u00a0 Credit: STRINGER An initial interim report into the mystery in 2015 looked closely at Captain Zaharie\u2019s background and behaviour in the lead-up to the flight, but found his \u201cability to handle stress at work and home was good\u201d. The report also stated: \u201cThere was no known history of apathy, anxiety, or irritability. There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict or family stresses.\u201d Captain Zaharie's wife,\u00a0Faizah Hanun, was questioned\u00a0a number of times by the FBI and Malaysian police about her husband\u2019s state of mind leading up to the flight. The pair were reported to have split-up before the crash, although they were still living under the same roof in Kuala Lumpur. A modern mystery | Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Speculation that Captain Zaharie may have brought the plane down as part of an elaborate insurance scam as also ruled out by the report, which found \u201cno record of him having secured a life insurance policy.\" Footage of the pilots and crew preparing to board the missing Boeing 777 again showed no untoward signs, with them appearing \"well groomed and attired\". On Zaharie's behaviour\u00a0investigators\u00a0concluded: \u201cThe gait, posture, facial expressions and mannerism were his normal characteristics.\" Disappearance MH370\u00a0lost contact with Malaysian Airlines less than an hour after it took of from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12.41am on 8 March 2014. No distress signal or communication was sent after it disappeared. MH370 flight path The plane\u2019s transponder, the instrument that communicates with ground radar, appeared to be shut down as it crossed from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace over the South China Sea. Initial investigations suggested the plane came down in the Indian Ocean south west of Australia, well out of its designated flight path. When it went down the plane was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers, including seven children.

Malaysia Airlines said four passengers who checked in for the flight did not show up at the airport on the day. \u2018Most expensive search in history\u2019 The search for MH370 is thought to be the most expensive ever conducted. The\u00a0mystery over its last location has lead to a vast search area of nearly three million square miles being designated. Since then Malaysian, Australian and Chinese teams have carried out underwater searches spanning 46,000 square miles in the southern Indian Ocean and found nothing. French police officers carry a piece of MH370 debris from a plane in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island, near Madagascar in 2015 Credit: AP\/Lucas Marie Debris from MH370 has washed up in beaches along the coastline of Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, Reunion Island and Mauritius. This has been attributed to the strength of the ocean\u2019s currents rather than giving any clues as to MH370\u2019s final resting place. A report released by the Australian search agency in December advised that if the plane was not found in the existing zone it was most likely to be in a 9,653 square-mile to the north. But after spending an estimated at \u00a390 million, the three countries decided to wind down the investigation earlier this year. Costs of searching for MH370 - D The decision was met with dismay from the families' official support group, Voice 370. In a statement it said: \u201cIn our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety.\u201d","published_at":1526252728,"content_id":"458dd201-b863-3cf7-b9da-e09ec9b2c0ad","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mh370-captain-apos-deliberately-evaded-230056591.html","content_published_at":1526280422,"content_time":1526280422,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8ca8a803-64ad-30df-a1ca-4e51be3aa7b4","post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-36136082-b593-36da-a9a0-3ae587be0cb9_a-8ca8a803-64ad-30df-a1ca-4e51be3aa7b4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

rail line to be built with private money has five bidders","summary":"Five bidders are in the running to build the first railway line under new government proposals aiming to fund new tracks entirely with private cash. Hong Kong-based transport giant MTR, which runs South Western Railway from Waterloo to the West Country with FirstGroup, and a scheme involving Baroness Valentine, the HS2 director, are among those vying to build a line linking towns and cities south of Heathrow directly with the airport. Bidders were invited to submit proposals in March as part of plans by ministers to inject extra cash into the railways. Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, has been vocal about his desire for rail access to Heathrow from the south, as improved transport links bolster the argument in favour of the third runway expansion proposals. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is trying to get more private capital into the railway industry to reduce the burden on the taxpayer Credit: John Robertson Although proposals can still be submitted until the end of July, a source close to the Government project said new challengers are unlikely. Officials are due to meet bidders today to outline their priorities for the project. The Heathrow Southern Railway bid backed by Baroness Valentine would link the airport to Staines on the Windsor-Staines line and connect to the existing South West main line between Byfleet and Woking. The Windsor Link Railway scheme, headed by George Bathurst, would provide links from the airport to the south and west as part of a larger scheme. Windsor could get a direct rail link to Heathrow once a scheme to build a line linking the south to Heathrow is constructed A light rail system has also been proposed by Interlinking Transit Solutions, headed up by Canadian Peter Buckley, as part of its broader Greater London transport proposal. The identity of the fifth bidder has not yet been disclosed. Once the bid deadline passes in July, the Government is expected to provide an update on the next stage of the process in the autumn. Depending on the scheme chosen, trains could be running on the new line as early as 2025. \u00a0","published_at":1526236819,"content_id":"77e04a10-5142-3d04-893d-5d8ac26be82c","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/first-rail-line-built-private-183525948.html","content_published_at":1526236525,"content_time":1526236525,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d7704841-3fbd-339d-9959-aabba330d9be","post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-7f3b2fc0-b2df-3680-b69d-343a6eda6536_a-d7704841-3fbd-339d-9959-aabba330d9be","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-7f3b2fc0-b2df-3680-b69d-343a6eda6536_a-d7704841-3fbd-339d-9959-aabba330d9be","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/many-toy-cars-needed-pull-5enyzmo","author":"third_watch","provider":"motor1","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.motor1.com","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/27bfa760-2c69-11e8-82de-0baa88a4c282_motor1_-Color_pos-.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/many-toy-cars-needed-pull-160002357.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6nqMksndqpX_FILknMrrYQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/motor1_us_477\/301f294132f59387f942636a6dd3d1e9","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AiCOTQxUt.TftGZ3RwC8KQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/motor1_us_477\/301f294132f59387f942636a6dd3d1e9","height":1080,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/motor1_us_477\/301f294132f59387f942636a6dd3d1e9","imgw":1920,"imgh":1080,"title":"How Many Toy Cars Are Needed To Pull A Jeep Grand Cherokee","summary":"Of course it worked.","published_at":1526227279,"content_id":"d7704841-3fbd-339d-9959-aabba330d9be","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/many-toy-cars-needed-pull-160002357.html","content_published_at":1526227202,"content_time":1526227202,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e4556dc1-755e-32ec-b68b-ac1dbf924d9a","post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-184806ae-cbca-3677-a451-b300470ba81b_a-e4556dc1-755e-32ec-b68b-ac1dbf924d9a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-184806ae-cbca-3677-a451-b300470ba81b_a-e4556dc1-755e-32ec-b68b-ac1dbf924d9a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/sunday-drive-spying-automotive-future-4nxxcy3","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Autoblog","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/?ncid=edlinkusauto00000021","provider_image":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-07-20\/cc8d7920-6d7e-11e7-9c9d-ffc8ad8cf431_Autoblog_64x64.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/sunday-drive-spying-automotive-future-145000838.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2SKJQp2ubeYDkP47VVs.Pw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/autoblog_50\/a953fcbf7cef58fda97a7c9c7c78c16c","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/VS4Ol5YuW4rH1CzwehpylA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NTA7dz04MDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/autoblog_50\/a953fcbf7cef58fda97a7c9c7c78c16c","height":450,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/autoblog_50\/a953fcbf7cef58fda97a7c9c7c78c16c","imgw":800,"imgh":450,"title":"Sunday Drive: Spying an automotive future of performance","summary":"I spy, with my little eye ... the future of the automotive world here in the United States.

NTSB investigators piecing together FIU bridge collapse, 'evidence tells the story'","summary":"After the I-35 bridge in Minnesota came crashing down into the Mississippi River a decade ago, killing 13 people in rush-hour traffic, National Transportation Safety Board investigators raced to the scene to find much of their evidence underwater and being pulled apart by backhoes in a frantic search for victims. In the painstaking months to come, they rebuilt portions of the bridge in a nearby park, using cranes and barges to move it downriver. Ultimately, a grainy video image led them to the bridge's tragic point of failure, but not before they dug through years of inspection and maintenance records, constructed models, sampled the steel and concrete used to build the bridge and parsed 40-year-old design plans. Two of the investigators on the case, Robert Accetta and Dan Walsh, are now applying that same methodical approach to unraveling the devastating collapse of the pedestrian bridge at Florida International University that killed six people last month.","published_at":1523965058,"content_id":"e5e617de-bbc9-3a1f-b416-3164a452c18a","content_url":"http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/local\/community\/miami-dade\/article208587214.html","content_published_at":1523595600,"content_time":1523595600,"content_relative_time":132,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":132,"comment_relative_time":132,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"80cabb7c-4e75-3aae-a742-e4ffb11b15b8","post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-31b8a87e-f9aa-38c1-8957-56eed4c9d6fd_a-80cabb7c-4e75-3aae-a742-e4ffb11b15b8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-31b8a87e-f9aa-38c1-8957-56eed4c9d6fd_a-80cabb7c-4e75-3aae-a742-e4ffb11b15b8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/tesla-pauses-model-3-production-2ckmc4i","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"TechCrunch","provider_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-05-23\/e43c7660-3ff3-11e7-9fa9-c994bde64e92_techcrunch.svg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tesla-pauses-model-3-production-235554833.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tom3zXTW7BRu7ut9mSP7ZA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/techcrunch_350\/95a6caa48aedb60c0bf4160e74b47ca0","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FOhYgXHVuw6gI.GQAT0JeA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNDAwO3c9MjEwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/techcrunch_350\/95a6caa48aedb60c0bf4160e74b47ca0","height":1400,"width":2100,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/techcrunch_350\/95a6caa48aedb60c0bf4160e74b47ca0","imgw":2100,"imgh":1400,"title":"Tesla pauses Model 3 production","summary":"Tesla has paused the production of Model 3, BuzzFeed first reported.

To pull that off, hackers are using UPnP weaknesses in commercial routers and other devices to reroute their traffic over and over again until it's nearly impossible to trace. \"We started talking about how many of these vulnerable devices are out there and what can they be leveraged for, because most people seem to have forgotten about this vulnerability,\" says Chad Seaman, a senior engineer on the security intelligence response team at Akamai.","published_at":1523320232,"content_id":"a68589b4-a59f-35f7-850c-356bf10c1c8b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/upnp-router-game-console-vulnerabilities-exploited\/?mbid=synd_digg","content_published_at":1523296595,"content_time":1523296595,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Internet of Things","vibe_id":"c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":22,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"938604b5-6ed1-3263-8710-9da079e99ce2","post_id":"v-c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724_c-42a8a380-0ba2-3231-823f-b6120011763f_a-938604b5-6ed1-3263-8710-9da079e99ce2","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-c8a104ba-3365-3ebc-b8f2-cc2a332ce724_c-42a8a380-0ba2-3231-823f-b6120011763f_a-938604b5-6ed1-3263-8710-9da079e99ce2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/internet-of-things\/internet-things-security-firm-armis-raises-30-million-133906835--sector-ge3uqub","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/internet-things-security-firm-armis-raises-30-million-133906835--sector.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Internet of Things security firm Armis raises $30 million","summary":"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - U.S.-Israeli Armis, a provider of Internet of Things (IoT) enterprise security, said on Monday it raised $30 million in financing, bringing the total it has raised to $47 million.

Kim gave his \"profound analysis and appraisal\" of the prospects for North Korea-U.S. dialogue at a meeting of the Politburo of the ruling party's Central Committee, the Korean Central News Agency reported. The meeting was held on Monday. The KCNA report did not specifically mention plans for Kim to hold a summit with President Donald Trump, expected in May or June, but it suggests Pyongyang is actively preparing for the meeting and is ready to let North Koreans know big events may be ahead.","published_at":1523253002,"content_id":"0b51c03c-702a-3c2d-a6c6-981b28a9d191","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/top-asian-news-5-14-m-gmt-051502648.html","content_published_at":1523329206,"content_time":1523329206,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":0,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e18b851e-5409-3b23-99da-d2b8d044128c","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-e89851a2-0989-3e17-aa1a-d8fad4aad65e_a-e18b851e-5409-3b23-99da-d2b8d044128c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-e89851a2-0989-3e17-aa1a-d8fad4aad65e_a-e18b851e-5409-3b23-99da-d2b8d044128c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/north-korean-flag-lights-pyongyangs-hotel-doom-54zbbfp","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korean-flag-lights-pyongyangs-hotel-doom-005041394.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fxy8aCMX2prkFsGS5di0_w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/c5844006f91e7edd9c5059bd0e72ec1fdf7183ba.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/53lRPcnJyXHlZaeeL1Znjw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/c5844006f91e7edd9c5059bd0e72ec1fdf7183ba.jpg","height":682,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/c5844006f91e7edd9c5059bd0e72ec1fdf7183ba.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":682,"title":"North Korean flag lights up Pyongyang's 'Hotel of Doom'","summary":"The towering hulk of the Ryugyong Hotel, a vast and unfinished edifice that has loomed over Pyongyang for decades, was lit up on Monday night.

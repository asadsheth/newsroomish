They got off to a blazing start in the Powerplay again with Fakhar Zaman smashing 25 in the first two overs. Once the first six overs had ended, they began to lose wickets and the wheels came off rapidly. Peshawar Zalmi skittled them out for 100, the lowest total in the PSL this year. Soon after, they became the fifth team to inflict defeat on Brendon McCullum's beleaguered side. This was the most resounding one yet, the first 10-wicket defeat in the history of the PSL.

Bancroft v Matthew Renshaw: Australia v South Africa","summary":"THE pressure is on Cameron Bancroft and the Australian selectors just one day into their series in South Africa, with former Test quick Brendon Julian criticising the omission of a back-up opener considering Bancroft's worrying form. The out-of-sorts opener copped another failure overnight, falling for five following a scratchy 20-ball stay at the crease \u2014 dismissing in unusual fashion as he charged down the wicket to Proteas quick Vernon Philander. It makes for sorry reading when you look at the 25-year-old's Test record. Through nine innings, Bancroft has just one score above 27. His average has dropped to 23 after nine innings \u2014 a mark which is boosted considerably by his unbeaten 82 on debut.","published_at":1520007894,"content_id":"cffb8d97-10d7-3e4b-bebe-07e4281d9cbe","content_url":"https:\/\/www.foxsports.com.au\/cricket\/australia\/australian-selectors-under-the-pump-after-cameron-bancrofts-latest-failure-with-matthew-renshaw-waiting-in-the-wings\/news-story\/5e15368e3c88dab6fef06db6e313296b?nk=71624648bd8e5e9a339b9aad5750ac72-1519963545","content_published_at":1519948080,"content_time":1519948080,"content_relative_time":143,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":143,"comment_relative_time":143,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-3e8a865d-322c-36f7-a180-bec149cb6018_a-a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-3e8a865d-322c-36f7-a180-bec149cb6018_a-a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-3e8a865d-322c-36f7-a180-bec149cb6018_a-a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Conservative Review","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.conservativereview.com\/articles\/mueller-weaponizing-unproven-dnc-podesta-hack-target-potus\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6H9EnzHEwP1mctA.SWiszw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5mIUaHtrDBZMQe9LIvjwhg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb-819659123.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3pdqxAUSd762rrETvp05wA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5mIUaHtrDBZMQe9LIvjwhg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb-819659123.jpeg","height":675,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5mIUaHtrDBZMQe9LIvjwhg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a0125f00-90a9-3237-8cd6-181c94dc57fb-819659123.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":675,"title":"Mueller is weaponizing unproven DNC & Podesta hack to target POTUS","summary":"Posted March 1, 2018 by Jordan Schachtel A A A More and more evidence continues to pile up that special counsel Robert Mueller is on the warpath to terminate the presidency of Donald Trump, regardless of the fact that there is no evidence of collusion or criminal behavior that would delegitimize his electoral victory.

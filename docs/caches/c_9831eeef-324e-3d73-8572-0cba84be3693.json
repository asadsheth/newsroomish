They got off to a blazing start in the Powerplay again with Fakhar Zaman smashing 25 in the first two overs. Once the first six overs had ended, they began to lose wickets and the wheels came off rapidly. Peshawar Zalmi skittled them out for 100, the lowest total in the PSL this year. Soon after, they became the fifth team to inflict defeat on Brendon McCullum's beleaguered side. This was the most resounding one yet, the first 10-wicket defeat in the history of the PSL.

Rashid and Hales have not played a Test since 2016 but the worry for some is that, without a major alteration to cricket's congested schedule and a change in spectator habits -- Tests outside of

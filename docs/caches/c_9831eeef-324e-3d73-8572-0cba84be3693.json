Coming in to bat first, the visitors set a 284-run target for the loss of five wickets, which the Black Caps achieved with four balls to spare. The match was in a dwindling situation but Santner's 45 off 27 balls swung and a six in the final dropped the ball to the hosts' court. New Zealand were on 27 in the first ten overs after losing three quick wickets. It was Taylor, who brought the hosts back on track with his 113-run innings.

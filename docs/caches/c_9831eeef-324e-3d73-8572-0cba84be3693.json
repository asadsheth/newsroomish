Their style of attack is consistent with everything head coach Tom Moody has put in place since he took over: the bowlers continue to hold teams to under 150 and the batsmen, perfectly set up to chase that kind of a middling score, are delivering. In fact, in one instance, even Billy Stanlake delivered with bat. Their last game was a clinical brushing aside of Kolkata Knight Riders in what was their first win at Eden Gardens. They have no such problems with their record in Mohali, where they've beaten Kings XI Punjab four times out of four.","published_at":1524067034,"content_id":"6dc4a26c-04fd-3d08-b0c3-ea3b72bec57a","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23231623\/can-kings-xi-keep-mohali-win-record-intact?","content_published_at":1523948400,"content_time":1523948400,"content_relative_time":66,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":66,"comment_relative_time":66,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-c1fb8ed4-5281-3957-b3f1-d91987b71ee7_a-76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-c1fb8ed4-5281-3957-b3f1-d91987b71ee7_a-76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/nottinghamshire-prevail-morning-12-wicket-2jsqg15","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"ESPNcricinfo","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23200020\/nottinghamshire-prevail-morning-12-wicket-madness","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tRPXYEarAhOpCAjzPyiv9w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KkijVqefrwESMtN_OI.ZcQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5-939185144.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EvcTk5plKctr25M.N5i1sA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Mjk7dz0xMjk2Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KkijVqefrwESMtN_OI.ZcQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5-939185144.jpeg","height":729,"width":1296,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KkijVqefrwESMtN_OI.ZcQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5-939185144.jpeg","imgw":1296,"imgh":729,"title":"Nottinghamshire prevail in morning of 12-wicket madness","summary":"Paul Edwards Nottinghamshire 222 (Bailey 3-26, Livingstone 3-27, Mennie 3-46) and 10 for 4 (Mennie 3-4) beat Lancashire 158 (Ball 5-43) and 73 (Gurney 6-25, Ball 4-14) by six wickets Scorecard It was a morning when batsmen came and went like leaders of UKIP; a morning when the rapidity of events boggled the scrambled mind and outstripped the scribbling pen; a morning when 12 wickets fell in exactly 15 overs, Lancashire losing their last eight for 15 runs.

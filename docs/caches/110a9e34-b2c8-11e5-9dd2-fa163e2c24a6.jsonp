Player ages are as of March 1, 2018. \u2022 FREE AGENCY, PODCAST-STYLE: Andy Benoit and Gary Gramling break down all the biggest offseason moves and the impact they'll have on 2018. Subscribe!QUARTERBACKS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Kirk Cousins (29)\u2014Intends to sign with Vikings (three-year deal)It\u2019s unusual to see a quality starting quarterback available in free agency, it\u2019s unheard of for that quarterback to the hit the market in a year when multiple teams (Denver, Minnesota and Jacksonville) have powerhouse defenses that leave them just a QB away from Super Bowl contention. Ultimately, Cousins landed in the right spot, for him and the Vikings. Case Keenum (30)\u2014Intends to sign with Broncos (two years, $36 million)His greatness in 2017 was legitimate\u2014he made plays not just by executing Pat Shurmur\u2019s shrewd designs, but also by improvising when those designs didn\u2019t work. Can Keenum do it again, this time without Shurmur? OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Josh McCown (39)\u2014Re-signed with Jets (one year, $10 million)Quietly, McCown had a stellar 2017 campaign in New York (94.5 passer rating). He\u2019s still a viable bridge guy, and maybe even an inexpensive option for a \u201cready to win now\u201d team that loses out on Cousins. Tom Savage (27)\u2014Intends to sign with SaintsHe must get more consistent in all facets, but at least he\u2019s willing to stand tall in the pocket. That gives him long-term value as a backup; coaches will believe he can keep their system afloat if he has to come off the bench. AJ McCarron (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Bills (two years, $10 million)The dearth of quality NFL quarterbacks has created a misconception around him. Maybe he is a diamond in the rough. But what there is no maybe about is that he has been the backup behind a very average quarterback for several years. Sam Bradford (30)\u2014Intends to sign with Cardinals (one year, $20 million)The most talented QB in free agency, but unfortunately the durability concerns have become overwhelming. Jay Cutler (34), DolphinsIf he wasn\u2019t great in an Adam Gase scheme that he\u2019d thrived in before, what makes you think he\u2019d thrive somewhere else? Mike Glennon (28)\u2014Intends to sign with CardinalsLet\u2019s not underestimate the value of a solid, qualified backup. Brock Osweiler (27), BroncosHis agents should dismiss his 2016 season in Houston and \u201917 season in Cleveland\/Denver and sell him as the high-end backup who helped keep the 2015 Broncos\u2019 Super Bowl season on track. If they believe a starting job might still be in his future, then sign a one-year contract for 2018. If they want long-term stability, they\u2019ll pursue a long-term contract as a No. 2. Geno Smith (27), GiantsSmith is a capable deep-intermediate passer and serviceable enough athlete, but with backup QBs, dependability is more important than talent. That works against Smith. Teddy Bridgewater (25)\u2014Intends to sign with Jets (one-year deal)He hasn\u2019t played in two years and he had arm strength limitations before he got injured. Matt Barkley (27), CardinalsTurnovers are a concern, but he had some productive outings in Chicago two seasons ago. Blaine Gabbert (28), CardinalsWhen the pocket is clean, he looks the part. But when the pocket becomes the least bit dirty, or even just threatens to be dirty, he\u2019s a wildcard. Matt Moore (33), DolphinsA proven backup, his landing spot could be decided by how teams view him as a mentor. Ryan Fitzpatrick (35)\u2014Re-signed with BucsHe almost became just the fourth QB in history to play for a quarter of the NFL\u2019s teams. (The others: Josh Johnson, Josh McCown and J.T. O\u2019Sullivan.) Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Andy Dalton (Bengals), Matt Schaub (Falcons)RUNNING BACKS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Le'Veon Bell (26), SteelersStill the best out-of-backfield creator in football, but would you believe Bell\u2019s longest run last year gained just 27 yards? (UPDATE: Bell has been franchise-tagged by the Steelers.) Carlos Hyde (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Browns (three years, $15 million)Not a dynamic receiving threat, but Hyde is a good enough first- and second-down runner to warrant three-down starter money on the open market. Isaiah Crowell (25)\u2014Intends to sign with Jets (three-year deal) A sustaining ballcarrier who has a touch more speed and power than you\u2019d guess. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Dion Lewis (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Titans (four-year deal)Lewis is a reliable, professional runner. What will be interesting is whether teams see him as a potential receiving threat. He didn\u2019t have to be that in New England thanks to James White, but Lewis\u2019s shifty quickness suggests he could be that kind of threat for a different team. Rex Burkhead (27)\u2014Re-signed with Patriots (three-year deal)His James White-style skillset can add dimension to an offense. That makes him more valuable to teams with smart veteran QBs who can take advantage. Frank Gore (34), ColtsHe can still slither through small cracks as a first- and second-down runner, though that\u2019s the extent of his abilities at this point. Jerick McKinnon (25)\u2014Intends to sign with 49ersHis production in Minnesota never quite matched his scat back attributes, but could the right team and system change that? LeGarrette Blount (31), EaglesHe\u2019s like an old pickup truck that looks worn down but still runs and hauls just fine. Blount is much more valuable in an interior run scheme, which shortens his list of suitors. Damian Williams (25), DolphinsA viable receiver who can align almost anywhere in the formation. Chris Ivory (29)\u2014Signed With Bills (two years, $5.5 million)Still a tenacious, difficult-to-tackle runner, especially if he\u2019s fresh in a No. 2 role. Shane Vereen (29), GiantsA viable receiver, though mostly just out of the backfield (and maybe the slot). Charles Sims (27), BucsYet another pass-catching back, and with more lateral agility than Williams or Vereen. Sims is coming off a disconcertingly quiet 2017 campaign, though. Terrance West (27), RavensHis running style fits most systems, but occasional indecisiveness is a concern. Danny Woodhead (33), RavensInjuries and age are now an issue, but he\u2019s worth taking a low-risk flyer to see if he can help your passing game. He\u2019s always been an excellent weapon on checkdowns. Adrian Peterson (32), CardinalsHe can still pound the rock on traditional runs, but offers nothing as a blocker or receiver, which makes an offense predictable when he\u2019s on the field. DeMarco Murray (30), TitansHis limited change-of-direction quickness makes him more reliant on good blocking than most ballcarriers. The problem is you can find younger, cheaper guys like the current iteration of Murray in the draft\u2019s later rounds. Doug Martin (29), BucsHe possess excellent short-area vision and movement skills, especially in heavy traffic. The question is what to make of his: (1) injuries, (2) off-field issues and (3) 2.9 YPC over each of the last two years? Orleans Darkwa (26), GiantsHe flashes intriguing short-area east-west movement and some stop-start ability, but it never quite came together in New York. Jeremy Hill (25), BengalsWill his 1,124-yard, 5.1-ypc rookie season from 2014 lead a team to take a flyer? Or will that success only make eyebrows scrunch even further when looking at his disappointing 2015, \u201916 and \u201917 seasons? Jonathan Stewart (30)\u2014Signed with GiantsMaybe not what he once was physically, but he has always been a cerebral player who just knows how to run. With the right O-line and quarterback, he can be an effective in a No. 2 role. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): C.J. Anderson (Broncos), Mike Gillislee (Patriots), Marshawn Lynch (Raiders), Lamar Miller (Texans), Latavius Murray (Vikings), Bilal Powell (Jets), Robert Turbin (Colts), T.J. Yeldon (Jaguars) FULLBACKS SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Anthony Sherman (29)\u2014Re-signed With ChiefsHe can handle the ball in select situations, giving some small, pleasantly surprising oomph to an offense\u2019s two-back packages. Mike Tolbert (32), BillsHe\u2019s no longer the wrecking ball runner he was in the early 2010s, and he has never been a pure lead-blocker. Zach Line (27), SaintsPrototypical plug-in fullback. Derrick Coleman (27), FalconsAnother plug-in fullback, just not quite as strong or dependable as Line.WIDE RECEIVERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Jarvis Landry (25)\u2014Traded to Browns under franchise tagAs an excellent short-area receiver who can also threaten intermediately inside, he can certainly enhance a quick-strike offense. The question is whether teams think he can upgrade a more traditional offense, sort of like Golden Tate did in Detroit. There are questions about maturity and route running discipline. Sammy Watkins (24)\u2014Intends to sign with Chiefs (three years, $48 million)Certainly better than his 593 yards for the Rams in 2017 suggest, but he\u2019s not a true No. 1 receiver. Allen Robinson (24)\u2014Intends to sign with Bears (three years, $42 million)Two concerns: He\u2019s coming off an ACL injury, and he was bad against press coverage in 2016. But prior to that, he was as intriguing of a downfield perimeter receiver as you\u2019ll find. Someone will risk big money in hopes of capturing that. John Brown (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Ravens (one year, $5 million)Speed and stop-start quickness can make him lethal \u2026 if he stays healthy enough to consistently display it. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Paul Richardson (25)\u2014Intends to sign with Washington (five years, $40 million)An acrobatic vertical receiver who is tough to evaluate as an every-down weapon given that he comes from an unusual Russell Wilson-led Seahawks offense. Jeremy Maclin (29), RavensA solid intermediate route runner who can produce within the context of a scheme, but Maclin is not someone who influences coverages. Jaron Brown (28), CardinalsCoaches love plugging in track star wideouts because of how they can control safeties. That opens up the rest of your designs. Dontrelle Inman (29), BearsFrom a mechanical standpoint, he\u2019s one of football\u2019s 10 best route runners. Danny Amendola (32)\u2014Intends to sign with DolphinsAt times he was invaluable in his slot role with New England. Many teams will fear that\u2019s the extent of what he can offer, though. Marqise Lee (26)\u2014Re-signed with JaguarsHe can be very good underneath (especially on crossing patterns), but he needs clean access off the line of scrimmage. The fact that he\u2019s not quite a pure slot receiver complicates things. Taylor Gabriel (27)\u2014Intends to sign with BearsA worthwhile No. 4, and maybe a No. 3, since he infuses an offense with speed. Jordy Nelson (33), PackersIn a well-schemed offense, he can be one of the league\u2019s best slot receivers. Donte Moncrief (24)\u2014Intends to sign with JaguarsUltimately a disappointment in Indy, but he has a neat enough toolkit for someone to take a short-term gamble on. Jordan Matthews (25), BillsA big, slow interior possession target. There are places for him, but not as many as there were 20 years ago. Albert Wilson (25)\u2014Intends to sign with Dolphins (three years, $24 million)Can run complimentary dig and corner routes as part of a multi-receiver design. Mike Wallace (31), RavensPresents only two things to defend: go routes (which he executes speedily but inconsistently) and shallow crossing routes. Ryan Grant (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Ravens (four years, $29 million)He possesses subtle shiftiness, but not enough to be much more than a puzzle piece. Terrelle Pryor (28), WashingtonHis regression in Washington was disappointing and off-putting. He\u2019s at his best running in-breaking routes, but we haven\u2019t\u2019 seen that since his 2016 season in Cleveland. Eric Decker (31), TitansEvery now and then he separates on the outside thanks to deceptive mechanics, but you sign him for his ability to beat zone coverage from the slot. Kendall Wright (28), BearsNot quite shifty enough to create matchup problems in the slot, and not quite big or polished enough to regularly contribute outside. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Dez Bryant (Cowboys), Randall Cobb (Packers), Michael Crabtree (Raiders), Allen Hurns (Jaguars), Brandon LaFell (Bengals), Brandon Marshall (Giants), Emmanuel Sanders (Broncos)TIGHT ENDS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Jimmy Graham (31)\u2014Intends to sign with Packers (three years)If teams believe he can still win out wide and from the slot, a contender could pay big money in hopes of pushing their offense over the edge. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Tyler Eifert (27), BengalsAs athletic and versatile as almost any tight end, but 41 missed games in five seasons raise a big red flag. Trey Burton (26)\u2014Intends to sign with Bears (four years, $32 million)He brings value to an offense that features multiple tight ends because he can operate from anywhere inside the painted field numbers. Eric Ebron (24), LionsHe improved his route running in recent years, but he never quite became a dynamic enough flex receiver to make up for his awful blocking. Martellus Bennett (30), PatriotsHe's aging, but his game was never predicated on quickness anyway. Even if decline sets in, he\u2019s equipped to prosper in a No. 2 role for another few years, especially given that he\u2019s an above average run-blocker. Antonio Gates (37), ChargersWatching him run these days is not unlike watching frozen honey leave that plastic bear-shaped bottle, but remember: Defenders must react to his tempo. They all can, but not all of them can handle his savvy, nuanced mechanics. Julius Thomas (29), DolphinsHe\u2019s still in his athletic prime, but the harsh truth is he\u2019s never been effective without Peyton Manning. Luke Willson (28), SeahawksA plug-and-play No. 2 tight end who can work in almost any package. Virgil Green (29)\u2014Intends to sign with ChargersHe has become much more of a blocker than receiver. Will teams see him as an H-back? Levine Toilolo (26), FalconsThe question is whether teams will see his uniquely lanky size as a plus or a minus in his run-blocking. That size has not translated to great receiving prowess, which is why he reached the open market. Richard Rodgers (26), PackersSoft hands, but not much twitch or power. Anthony Fasano (33), DolphinsOne of those guys who keeps getting on the field because coaches know he won\u2019t make mistakes. Austin Seferian-Jenkins (25), JetsDon\u2019t fall for his flirtations. Ben Watson (37), RavensIf a team needs a No. 2 receiving tight end who can learn a playbook quickly, his career will continue. Brent Celek (33), EaglesRemains an adequate blocker, but might not be enough of a receiving threat to justify a roster spot. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Dwayne Allen (Patriots), James Hanna (Cowboys), Vance McDonald (Steelers)OFFENSIVE TACKLES DIFFERENCE MAKERS Nate Solder (29)\u2014Intends to sign with Giants (four years, $60 million)He\u2019s too up-and-down in pass protection to be elite, but has the nimbleness to continue being a quality starting left tackle. Justin Pugh (27), GiantsHis stubbier body type lends itself better to guard, but he brings decent athleticism to the right tackle position, which is better than what most teams have. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Chris Hubbard (26)\u2014Intends to sign with BrownsThe Steelers did not miss a beat when he filled in for injured\/suspended right tackle Marcus Gilbert for 10 games last season. Cameron Fleming (25), PatriotsHe improved steadily as a backup the last few years in New England. Will someone take a flyer hoping he\u2019s the next Marcus Cannon? LaAdrian Waddle (26), PatriotsHe\u2019s too lumbering to ever be more than a plug-in right tackle, but to his immense credit, he was a very reliable plug-in right tackle for the Pats in 2017. James Hurst (26), RavensHe has the body of a tackle, but not the body control. Ideally, you\u2019re signing him to be a utility backup. Andre Smith (31)\u2014Intends to sign with Cardinals (two years, $8 million)You have to assume he\u2019ll play no more than 10 games. But hey, at least he can play those games at any position (except center). Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Duane Brown (Seahawks), Bryan Bulaga (Packers), Jared Veldheer (Cardinals), Menelik Watson (Broncos)GUARDS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Andrew Norwell (26)\u2014Signed With Jaguars (five years, $66.5 million)Not as good as his befuddling first-team All-Pro accolade suggests, but he plays with the balance, dexterity and physical strength to improve a team\u2019s man-blocking running game. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Jack Mewhort (26), ColtsA solid, reliable starter \u2026 if he can stay on the field. He has missed 17 games over the last two years. Josh Kline (28)\u2014Re-signed with Titans (two-year deal)He\u2019ll be as good as the guys around him. Josh Sitton (31), BearsHe\u2019s in decline but not washed up, and his ability to play anywhere along the interior expands his market. Shawn Lauvao (30), WashingtonHe can be vulnerable in pass protection, but is a decent mover for his size, which boosts a zone-running game and backfield screen game. Zach Fulton (26)\u2014Intends to sign with TexansHe quietly started 46 games in four years with the Chiefs. Some team that\u2019s solid up front but has been shaky at one of its guard spots will want him. D.J. Fluker (27), GiantsIt\u2019s hard to understand how a player with his size and north\/south plowing ability hasn\u2019t had a better career. Jonathan Cooper (28), CowboysHe was surprisingly sturdy in Dallas, where he played between superstars Tyron Smith and Travis Frederick. History says he\u2019ll disappoint if not playing under such favorable circumstances. Kevin Pamphile (27), BucsLast season he had several highlight reel plays, both for the offense and defense. Senio Kelemete (27)\u2014Intends to sign with TexansHe held up admirably as a fill-in guy for many years in New Orleans. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Jeff Allen (Texans), Zane Beadles (49ers), Ronald Leary (Broncos), Andy Levitre (Falcons)CENTERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Weston Richburg (26)\u2014Intends to sign with 49ersA very good second-level blocker, and he has the necessary athleticism to get out in front on most screens. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Spencer Long (27)\u2014Intends to sign with JetsOne of the league\u2019s better-moving centers. Can be a quality starter in an outside zone run-based offense? John Sullivan (32), RamsHis football IQ is off the charts, which was huge for the Rams and young QB Jared Goff last year. Travis Swanson (27), LionsHe has the tools of a first-stringer, but has missed two, four and five games over the last three seasons. Ryan Jensen (26), RavensHe\u2019s a fighter, which some believe is enough to make you a quality interior O-line starter. Russell Bodine (25), BengalsOver the last two years he had too many negative plays, particularly in the running game and against designer pass-rush tactics.EDGE PLAYERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Demarcus Lawrence (25)\u2014Signed franchise tag tender with Cowboys (one year, $17 million)There\u2019s almost zero chance he gets past the franchise tag. Too bad for teams needing a proven edge guy\u2014the gap between Lawrence and No. 2 (Ziggy Ansah) is substantial. Ezekiel Ansah (28), LionsLong and talented, but also injury-prone and enigmatic. In 2016 he was excellent but had only two sacks. In 2017, he was subpar (by star standards) but had 12 sacks. It will be fascinating to see what kind of offers he draws. (UPDATE: Ansah has been franchise-tagged by the Lions.) OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Julius Peppers (38), Panthers\u2014Re-signed with Panthers (one-year deal)According to his age, he should be washed up. But that\u2019s been true for five years now. As a situational pass rusher, he\u2019s still in the NFL\u2019s upper echelon. Alex Okafor (27), SaintsHe was having a career year in New Orleans before tearing his Achilles last November. Trent Murphy (27), WashingtonHe needs to be in a hybrid 3-4 style scheme that allows him to align in different positions, a la Jarret Johnson for the Ravens in the 2000s. Barkevious Mingo (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Seahawks (two years, $6.8 million)Warning to potential suitors: Don\u2019t think you can be the one who finally turns him into a true edge rusher. He found his home as a move-around joker piece for the Colts last year, where he had responsibilities as a blitzer, spy and occasional zone coverage dropper. That must be his permanent role. Adrian Clayborn (29), FalconsA disruptive in-line run defender who can also make noise as a pass rusher (especially against an overmatched backup left tackle!). Connor Barwin (31), RamsAt this point he\u2019s the duct tape or WD-40 of football players. As a complementary short-term problem-solving piece, and he\u2019s excellent, both in a 4-3 and a 3-4. But if you need a building block (even a short-term one), look elsewhere. Jerry Attaochu (25), ChargersHe never fully blossomed as a Charger, in part due to injury. He has loose hips, a long frame and supple body control. Could he be a Jerry Hughes-type who finds his footing midway through his career? Kony Ealy (26), JetsOr could he be a Jerry Hughes type? The Patriots and Jets already took a chance on Ealy, and determined no. He\u2019s hoping one more team will give it a shot. Willie Young (31), BearsLast October\u2019s season-ending triceps injury shouldn\u2019t impact his physical status much for 2018. He\u2019s still spry enough to bend the edge playing 15-20 snaps a game. Young was a handful at times in the few games he did play last season. Pernell McPhee (29), BearsA viable rotational piece who can attack inside or outside, especially on designer pass rush tactics like stunts and twists. Durability is a concern. Tamba Hali (34), ChiefsHe has always amplified his burst with good leverage and tenacity. Can that carry him for another year or two? Elvis Dumervil (34), 49ersRoster spaces rarely go to guys who play 10-15 defensive snaps but zero special teams. His reputation as an on-field teacher could earn him one more stint, though. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Cliff Avril (Seahawks), Robert Ayers (Bucs), Allen Bailey (Chiefs), Clay Matthews (Packers), Shea McClellin (Patriots), Brooks Reed (Falcons), Terrell Suggs (Ravens), Cameron Wake (Dolphins)DEFENSIVE LINEMEN DIFFERENCE MAKERS Ndamukong Suh (31), DolphinsHe wasn\u2019t dominant in 2017, but he didn\u2019t look washed up either. Still, 31-year-old, one-gap defensive tackles don\u2019t often garner big bucks. His best fit remains in a true gap-shooting 4-3 scheme. Several teams who run this scheme have cap space: Indy, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Cincinnati and Buffalo, to name a few. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see what he gets on the open market. Star Lotulelei (28)\u2014Intends to sign with BillsHe possesses excellent short-area power and the athleticism to shoot gaps as a pass rusher. He\u2019s not Fletcher Cox or Aaron Donald, but he could be the missing piece that makes a good defensive line great. Sheldon Richardson (27), SeahawksThe talent is irrefutable. The question is, given his history, who wants to make him uber-rich and then hope he grows up? OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Muhammad Wilkerson (28)\u2014Intends to sign with PackersThe question is: Did he fall off in New York because he got injured, or because he got paid? Or was it both? Does it even matter? Immense talent makes him worth the gamble, but only at a reasonable price. Dontari Poe (27), FalconsThe Falcons sold him on their team last year by arguing that their scheme would increase his opportunities to get upfield and accumulate value-rising sacks. It didn\u2019t quite go that way\u2014he had 2.5 sacks on the season\u2014but plenty of teams will still want his combination of size and light feet. Shamar Stephen (27), VikingsAn above-average run defender who blended in along Minnesota\u2019s rich defensive line, someone could pay him surprisingly big money to become a fulltime starter. Bennie Logan (28), ChiefsHis quiet season in Kansas City suggests he\u2019s better suited for a 4-3 nose-shade role, as opposed to a true nose tackle or 3-4 defensive end role. For multiple years as a nose shade, his lateral movement ability brought unique playmaking prowess to Philly\u2019s run defense. DaQuan Jones (26)\u2014Re-signed with Titans (three years, $21 million)He can beat bad blockers off the snap, and at times he has flashed as a run defender. Kyle Williams (34)\u2014Re-signed with BillsThe wear and tear of 12 outstanding seasons will make some leery, but the Bills trust that his tenacity and technique can produce a 13th outstanding season. Brent Urban (26)\u2014Re-signed with Ravens (one-year deal)He was quietly one of football\u2019s better run-stoppers before his Week 3 Lisfranc injury last year. Denico Autry (27)\u2014Intends to sign with ColtsHas shown intriguing traits as a pass rusher, though not often enough to warrant big long-term money. If the market proves soft, would he bet on himself with a one-year deal? One thing\u2019s certain: He\u2019ll maximize his value wherever he goes. His effort always stands out on film. Tyrunn Walker (28), RamsHe only played 15-20 snaps a game off the bench, but always stood out on film. Haloti Ngata (34)\u2014Intends to sign with Eagles (one-year deal)The Lions run defense went kerplunk after he tore his biceps in Week 5. Durability and age are a concern, but all it takes is one team to believe he can compensate with his considerable football IQ. Chris Baker (30)\u2014Signed With Bengals (one year, $3 million)A better pass rusher than his body type suggests, though didn\u2019t produce nearly enough here in Tampa Bay. Jay Bromley (25), GiantsHe was a steady puzzle piece along a strong run-stopping interior Giants D-line. Justin Ellis (27)\u2014Re-signed with Raiders (three years, $15 million)Little more than a space-eater. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Tyson Alualu (Steelers), Sharrif Floyd (Vikings), Abry Jones (Jaguars), Brandon Mebane (Chargers), Domata Peko (Broncos)STACK LINEBACKERS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Nigel Bradham (28)\u2014Re-signed with Eagles (five years, $40 million)He has developed into a quality three-down contributor with some playmaking prowess, both in run and pass D. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Tahir Whitehead (27), LionsHe can be very disruptive when pinning his ears back and pursuing the ball\u2014needs to be a piece in a linebacking unit, not its headliner. Avery Williamson (26)\u2014Intends to sign with JetsHe rarely came off the field in Tennessee thanks to his gap-soundness in run D and serviceability against the pass. NaVorro Bowman (29), RaidersIt\u2019s hard to imagine the Raiders not making a strong run at re-signing him given the way he saved their decrepit linebacking corps last year. It is, however, a new coaching staff there\u2026 Zach Brown (28), WashingtonHis pursuit speed is excellent, but he\u2019s not immune to misreads. Paul Posluszny (33)\u2014Will announce his retirement.He doesn\u2019t run like he used to, but is so smart and fundamentally sound (flawless?) that it often doesn\u2019t matter. Todd Davis (25)\u2014Re-signed with BroncosHe\u2019s higher on this list because he\u2019s so stingy against the run, but his vulnerability in coverage could leave him with less money than guys below him (like Hitchens, Pierre-Louis and maybe even Bynes). Jerell Freeman (31), BearsHis flashing downhill burst can, at times, make him look almost as good as any \u2018backer in the league. Anthony Hitchens (25)\u2014Intends to sign with ChiefsThe talent is evident, but he couldn\u2019t secure an every-down role last season. Why? Preston Brown (25), BillsAverage in every sense of the word. Demario Davis (29)\u2014Intends to sign with SaintsHe\u2019s too young to be washing up, but where was he down the stretch? Karlos Dansby (36), CardinalsOne of those guys who does everything right, which makes coaches comfortable. That\u2019s why he\u2019ll always crack the starting lineup if he\u2019s on the roster. Kevin Pierre-Louis (26), ChiefsKansas City\u2019s defense at times looked better when he rotated in for an aging Derrick Johnson. Jon Bostic (26), ColtsHe\u2019s by no means dynamic, but has developed good awareness in zone coverage. Josh Bynes (28)\u2014Re-signed with CardinalsMultiple times for the Lions and Cardinals he did a stellar job as a fill-in first-teamer. He\u2019s worth considering as a passing-down specialist. Will Compton (28), WashingtonA few times he\u2019s earned playing time ahead of more talented players. He\u2019s worth signing as a source of quality depth. Christian Jones (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Lions (two-year deal)Most of his snaps have come as a passing-down specialist. Given how much nickel teams play these days, could he garner low-end starter money? Devon Kennard (26)\u2014Intends to sign with Lions (three years, $18.75 million)Brings value as a strong-side \u2019backer who can get physical with tight ends off the snap. Derrick Johnson (35), ChiefsAge and injuries have finally caught up. A tip of the cap for a wonderful career, and an inclusion on this list because he has risen from the dead enough times that completely writing him off feels unwise. Lawrence Timmons (31), DolphinsHe turns 32 in May, and the age started to show last year. That\u2019s a problem because he\u2019s never been an especially cerebral player. Potential Cap Casualties (in alphabetical order): Ray-Ray Armstrong (Giants), Vincent Rey (Bengals)CORNERBACKS DIFFERENCE MAKERS Trumaine Johnson (28)\u2014Intends to sign with JetsHe has traveled with No. 1 receivers at times in recent years and won more battles than he\u2019s lost. That he can travel in man and zone coverage should raise his value. Malcolm Butler (28)\u2014Intends to sign with TitansDid you know he didn\u2019t play in Super Bowl LII? Teams will find out what\u2019s behind that and shape their offer accordingly. If he has a clean image, he\u2019ll get top-10 corner money. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Vontae Davis (29)\u2014Signed With Bills (one year, $5 million)Injuries have become so routine that it\u2019s hard to envision anyone offering him more than No. 2 money, even though, when he\u2019s healthy, his physical nature can contest with many No. 1s. Aaron Colvin (26)\u2014Intends to sign with Texans (four-year deal)He was overshadowed by the litany of stars on Jacksonville\u2019s defense, but a closer look reveals him as one of the league\u2019s best slot corners. That\u2019s an important\u2014and difficult\u2014position to fill. Kyle Fuller (26), BearsHis first year in Chicago was tremendous, and so was much of his last. It\u2019s those years in between that might make teams slow to pull the trigger. Whoever signs him will be getting a quality ball-in-air outside defender. (UPDATE: Fuller has received the transition tag from the Bears.) Richard Sherman (29)\u2014Signed With 49ers (three years, $39.15 million)He was still a high-level perimeter press corner last fall, but signs of decline and an Achilles injury as he enters his age-30 season are legitimate causes for concern. Patrick Robinson (30)\u2014Signed with Saints (four-year deal)He was one of football\u2019s best slot defenders. The Eagles have youth and depth at corner, but they may want to think long and hard before letting him go. Morris Claiborne (28), JetsHad some nice stretches as the Jets\u2019 top cover corner last season. A team in need of a No. 2, especially if it runs a mostly zone-based scheme, will want him. Rashaan Melvin (28), ColtsHe performed admirably in difficult circumstances for the Colts last season. He did that down the stretch for Baltimore a few years ago, too. E.J. Gaines (26), BillsHe\u2019s experienced in a wide range of schemes, both outside and in the slot. David Amerson (26)\u2014Signed With Chiefs (one year, $2.25 million)He had a great stretch in the second half of 2016, but has been erratic for much of his six-year career. Nickell Robey-Coleman (26)\u2014Re-signed with Rams (three years, $15.75 million)He\u2019s at his best in attack-mode, including on slot blitzes. Considering this and his adequacy in man coverage, a pressure-based defense should want him. Prince Amukamara (28)\u2014Re-signing with BearsglIdeally, he\u2019s your No. 4 corner, giving you confidence that your defense could survive if a starting outside corner were out for a few weeks. Nevin Lawson (26)\u2014Re-signed with LionsAnother nice plug-in guy who could add valuable depth, especially given that he has the body to play outside or in the slot. Bashaud Breeland (26)\u2014Intends to sign with Panthers (three years, $24 million)About as up-and-down as they come. What that means for his open market value remains to be seen. D.J. Hayden (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Jaguars (three years, $19 million)Jacksonville brought in Hayden to replace Aaron Colvin in the slot\u2014that\u2019s iffy, it would be a major downgrade inside. Leonard Johnson (28), BillsIt seems like he\u2019s become an off-the-street midseason slot starter every year of his career. Was his solid 2017 season in Buffalo enough to get him a permanent home? Dontae Johnson (26), 49ersHe had too many bad plays in downfield coverage last season. He should consider taking a one-year \u201cprove it\u201d deal and hope to bounce back. Ross Cockrell (26), GiantsHe has played significant snaps in matchup zone schemes for the Steelers and Giants. That\u2019s enough to secure a No. 4 job, with a chance to compete at No. 3. Davon House (28), PackersAfter watching almost every snap of his seven-year career on film, it\u2019s still hard to declare whether he\u2019s good or bad. T.J. Carrie (27)\u2014Intends to sign with Browns (four years, $31 million)His experience in the slot and as a punt returner will bolster his value as a backup. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (31), GiantsHe has long been a player with exaggerated highs and lows. His value hinges on what teams think of his film from the second half of 2018, when he played a variety of positions for the Giants, including sub-package linebacker. Jeremy Lane (27), SeahawksHe's too young to write off, but durability is a concern. Another negative (for him): His ability to play inside would normally set him apart, but this year\u2019s cornerback market is unusually flush with slot defenders. Lardarius Webb (32), RavensHis ability to play safety makes him a viable dime back option\u2014and he\u2019s still a capable slot defender in a zone scheme. Someone will get a good deal on him. Adam Jones (34), BengalsHe lost playing time to recent first-round pick Willie Jackson last year\u2014and it was surprising that Jones didn\u2019t lose more. (That might be a commentary on Jackson's strong play, though.) Jones can still play, but given his decline and notorious temperament, teams might not bother. Brent Grimes (34)\u2014Re-signed with Bucs (one-year deal)Many of us thought he would wash up a few years ago, but then he went to Tampa Bay and prospered. So we say, with a sprinkle of caution: He showed signs of decline last season.SAFETIES DIFFERENCE MAKERS Eric Reid (26), 49ersTeams would be foolish to pass on him because of the anthem protests. He\u2019s a playmaker and one of the better multi-tool defenders in football, with significant experience at both safety spots, in the slot and at linebacker. Lamarcus Joyner (27), RamsA rangy centerfielder who can cover certain slot receivers in base defense; he\u2019s undersized, but he\u2019s also one of football\u2019s nastiest hitters. Tyrann Mathieu (25), CardinalsHe still has a unique blend of versatility and explosiveness, but his once-incredible change-of-direction ability has dulled after multiple knee injuries. Morgan Burnett (29), PackersHe started 102 games in Green Bay, so the perception is that he\u2019s old. But 29 is middle-age for a smart safety. Adding to his value is that he\u2019s proven to be every bit as versatile as Eric Reid. OTHER SIGNIFICANT FREE AGENTS Kenny Vaccaro (27), SaintsHe never quite developed the cover skills to fulfill his first-round billing with the Saints, but teams that want to play with three safeties on first and second down will be very interested. Tavon Wilson (28)\u2014Re-signed with Lions (two years, $7 million)He\u2019s at his best in the box, particularly when rotating down into it after the snap. Kurt Coleman (29)\u2014Signed With Saints (three years, $18 million)An aggressive zone defender who has a knack for dis","published_at":1521108500,"content_id":"626955ee-c450-3e8e-8904-0b348ce720fb","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-free-agency-2018-guide-132636134.html","content_published_at":1521082529,"content_time":1521082529,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-1a37afd7-5448-3380-87e8-63405c1b9129_a-22eb92bd-62d9-314c-86b9-be6394da7787","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-1a37afd7-5448-3380-87e8-63405c1b9129_a-22eb92bd-62d9-314c-86b9-be6394da7787","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cowboys-either-aren-t-interested-213948091.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MIyfYlRYVV1vhJ88KXFxBw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/ed4abcb44ac353fc552df13e91587b1c","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yWxmE_J3Q5fnFb_aTt8l6g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MjI7dz05MjQ7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/ed4abcb44ac353fc552df13e91587b1c","height":522,"width":924,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/ed4abcb44ac353fc552df13e91587b1c","imgw":924,"imgh":522,"title":"Cowboys either are or aren\u2019t interested in Ndamukong Suh","summary":"The Cowboys and Seahawks are interested in Ndamukong Suh, Dianna Russini of ESPN reports.

Pryor Rumors: 49ers, Rams, Browns Interested in Signing WR","summary":"One year after signing a one-year deal with the Washington Redskins, Terrelle Pryor is generating interest as he hits the open market once again. The Cleveland Browns, the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers are all among the teams interested in signing the 6'4\", 228-pound wideout, according to NFL Network's Michael Silver. Pryor spent the first three years of his NFL career as a quarterback with the Oakland Raiders before turning into a dynamic receiver for the Browns. Pryor's bet on himself did not go as planned. An\u00a0ankle injury\u00a0limited him to just nine games in 2017, and he caught just 20 passes for 240 yards and one touchdown when he was on the field.

Then, they followed through and got a slot target for the offense. Taylor Gabriel will sign a four-year deal with the Bears on Wednesday with the start of free agency. The deal was first reported on Twitter by former NFL receiver Andrew Hawkins, citing Gabriel himself as the source.

The mass exodus by the three quarterbacks is logical considering the Vikings are on the verge of signing Kirk Cousins to a three-year, $84 million contract.

Suddenly, the expectations for Cleveland's offseason have radically changed. Will free agents look at the team differently now as GM John Dorsey continues building a roster that fits his philosophy? Does having Taylor in the fold give the front office the flexibility to take Saquon Barkley No. 1 overall and go back to QB at No. 4 in the draft? As Landry tweeted, \"S--- about to get SERIOUS?.\" But as important as the combo of moves could turn out to be, for now they accentuate an addition Cleveland made weeks ago\u2014with significantly less profanity laden fanfare.See, Taylor and Landry are talented in idiosyncratic ways. Taylor is elite at limiting interceptions (throwing them at the lowest rate in the league last year), but he will also overlook open receivers, and he is at his best in a system that utilizes his running ability. Landry, meanwhile, was third-to-last among qualifying receivers in yards at catch; on average, he got the ball 4.4 yards away from the line of scrimmage. And they join a collection of unique assets already on the Browns roster, like 5'11\" wideout Corey Coleman or running back Duke Johnson, who had more receiving targets than rushes in 2017.When Todd Haley took to the podium for the first time as Cleveland's offensive coordinator on Valentine's Day, he said, \"What I believe in is playing to every player\u2019s strength that you have as best you can\u2014putting players into position to succeed, playing to their skillset.\" It's a bit of coach speak, but it's going to have to become his most important mantra. Haley figured out how to develop and deploy distinctive talents in Pittsburgh while building an explosive offense, but he's going to have to do it completely differently this time around. At the same time, Hue Jackson, who has surrendered offensive control and play-calling duties for the first time since coming to Cleveland, will have to figure out how he factors into all of this. The front office seems intent on bringing in pieces, but can the staff get them to fit? Not getting this newsletter in your inbox yet? Join The MMQB\u2019s Morning Huddle .

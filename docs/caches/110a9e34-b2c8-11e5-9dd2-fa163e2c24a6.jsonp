Instead, the Jaguars made the worst signing of free agency to date, inking D.J. Hayden to a three-year, $19 million deal with $9.5 million guaranteed, per Adam Caplan of Sirius XM.

He seemed nostalgic for simpler times while referencing the year when his first stint as the Raiders sideline boss began. Much has changed in two decades around the NFL. Or in one decade, which is the amount of time between when Gruden last wore a headset for coaching purposes, and not for broadcasting in the Monday night booth. For reasons only clear to him it seems he was very serious about climbing into his football time machine. We know this because of more than just his words, and the comedy routine in Indianapolis.

With plenty of options ahead of them, here are where the five previous teams went at No. 8 in the draft. 2017: Stanford RB Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers McCaffrey was a dual-threat in the run and pass game for the Panthers, who made the playoffs. McCaffrey hauled in 80 receptions for 651 yards and five touchdowns, while he ran for 435 yards and two touchdowns. Time will tell how he improves in his second season. 2016: Michigan St. OT Jack Conklin, Tennessee Titans Conklin was nothing short of a stud in his rookie season, starting all 16 games and making first team All-Pro. 2015: Clemson EDGE Vic Beasley, Atlanta Falcons","published_at":1520897109,"content_id":"c4396e02-e3ea-3249-b254-8921f57dcd34","content_url":"http:\/\/www.stltoday.com\/sports\/football\/the-chicago-bears-have-the-no-pick-of-the-nfl\/article_7888db55-e7c3-5bd9-bcb8-64412963976e.html","content_published_at":1520891100,"content_time":1520891100,"content_relative_time":93,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-9ffce745-bfba-315a-a380-cf58982cb5f6_a-fe2c8365-4859-3506-969d-6fb93228f7ad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-9ffce745-bfba-315a-a380-cf58982cb5f6_a-fe2c8365-4859-3506-969d-6fb93228f7ad","author":"third_watch","provider":"UPI","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Sports_News\/NFL\/2018\/03\/11\/Cleveland-Browns-trades-stunned-NFL-teams\/3011520803868\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QitFE4JOKH_U1CNNNE7BxA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/q985QsbBarS2DNl40Dvrnw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fe2c8365-4859-3506-969d-6fb93228f7ad--74498034.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eK8WLExch1gN4iru6.lADg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTk7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/q985QsbBarS2DNl40Dvrnw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fe2c8365-4859-3506-969d-6fb93228f7ad--74498034.jpeg","height":399,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/q985QsbBarS2DNl40Dvrnw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fe2c8365-4859-3506-969d-6fb93228f7ad--74498034.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":399,"title":"Cleveland Browns' trades stunned NFL teams","summary":"From not being able to properly file paperwork to consummate a trade in October to making three trades in a matter of just hours, the Cleveland Browns left many in the NFL with their heads spinning.

Suddenly, the expectations for Cleveland's offseason have radically changed. Will free agents look at the team differently now as GM John Dorsey continues building a roster that fits his philosophy? Does having Taylor in the fold give the front office the flexibility to take Saquon Barkley No. 1 overall and go back to QB at No. 4 in the draft? As Landry tweeted, \"S--- about to get SERIOUS?.\" But as important as the combo of moves could turn out to be, for now they accentuate an addition Cleveland made weeks ago\u2014with significantly less profanity laden fanfare.See, Taylor and Landry are talented in idiosyncratic ways. Taylor is elite at limiting interceptions (throwing them at the lowest rate in the league last year), but he will also overlook open receivers, and he is at his best in a system that utilizes his running ability. Landry, meanwhile, was third-to-last among qualifying receivers in yards at catch; on average, he got the ball 4.4 yards away from the line of scrimmage. And they join a collection of unique assets already on the Browns roster, like 5'11\" wideout Corey Coleman or running back Duke Johnson, who had more receiving targets than rushes in 2017.When Todd Haley took to the podium for the first time as Cleveland's offensive coordinator on Valentine's Day, he said, \"What I believe in is playing to every player\u2019s strength that you have as best you can\u2014putting players into position to succeed, playing to their skillset.\" It's a bit of coach speak, but it's going to have to become his most important mantra. Haley figured out how to develop and deploy distinctive talents in Pittsburgh while building an explosive offense, but he's going to have to do it completely differently this time around. At the same time, Hue Jackson, who has surrendered offensive control and play-calling duties for the first time since coming to Cleveland, will have to figure out how he factors into all of this. The front office seems intent on bringing in pieces, but can the staff get them to fit? Not getting this newsletter in your inbox yet? Join The MMQB\u2019s Morning Huddle .

Peter King spoke to both Sherman and 49ers GM John Lynch in his column. 2. Somewhat lost in the Browns-focused swirl, Panthers GM Marty Hurney continued his aggressive offseason, trading third-year corner Daryl Worley to Philadelphia for Torrey Smith in the hopes of providing Cam Newton with a big play receiver. 3. Three more veteran defenders could be hitting the free agency heap, as the Giants moved on from Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, the Bengals parted ways with Adam Jones, and the Steelers reportedly planned to cut Mike Mitchell. 4.

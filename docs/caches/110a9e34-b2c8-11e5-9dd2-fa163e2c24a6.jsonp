Hidden in the announcement was the addition of a player through a waiver claim. The Cardinals were awarded linebacker Jeremy Cash, previously of the Cleveland Browns. He originally entered the league in 2016 as an undrafted rookie with the Carolina Panthers, where he was coached by Cardinals defensive coordinator Al Holcomb, who was linebackers coach there. Cardinals coach Steve Wilks was also a position coach and assistant coach that year. Cash, 6-0, 230, played eight games for the Panthers and picked up six special teams tackles.

The Bears put the transition tag on Fuller earlier this month with a one-year salary of $12.9 million. That gives the Bears the right to match any offer Fuller gets, and the Bears have five days to make that decision. The amount of money in the offer sheet Fuller signed with the Packers remains unclear. When the Bears placed the transition tag on Fuller, general manager Ryan Pace said the team was buying time to reach a long-term deal with Fuller.

Instead, the Jaguars made the worst signing of free agency to date, inking D.J. Hayden to a three-year, $19 million deal with $9.5 million guaranteed, per Adam Caplan of Sirius XM.

Obviously not his playing time. And it doesn't seem likely to go up anytime soon. Okafor racked up another DNP-Coach's Decision on Tuesday, despite the absence of starter Jarrett Allen and the dominance of Toronto's Jonas Valanciunas. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson had implied Okafor could see more playing time. But actions speak louder than words, and his refusal to use the 6-foot-11, 255-pound center even in a time of need screamed that this experiment may be shelved for the season \u2014 or ended altogether. As a pending free agent, Brooklyn can't offer Okafor more than $6.2 million this summer.

I know Dak [Prescott] is watching this like, \u2018Yeah, he\u2019s coming.\u2019 Yeah, I am,\u201d Bennett told reporters, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd Alex Smith, he knows he can\u2019t run from me. I told him in the Pro Bowl.\u201dThe Eagles acquired Bennett and a seventh-round pick in exchange for a fifth-round pick and receiver Marcus Johnson.Bennett joins an already fearsome Philadelphia defensive line, with Brandon Graham, Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan, Chris Long, Derek Barnett and Haloti Ngata.The Eagles lost Beau Allen and Vinny Curry this offseason but their absence will be mitigated by the arrival of Bennett and Ngata, giving the team just as much depth along the defensive front as their Super Bowl-winning team did. That\u2019s crucial for defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who likes to rotate his defensive line during games to keep players fresh.","published_at":1521508096,"content_id":"f30a7a1a-a366-304c-8f88-00a54351c4b2","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/michael-bennett-nfc-east-qbs-221315842.html","content_published_at":1521497595,"content_time":1521497595,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-45886ba2-1ae7-38ff-b7e2-4a9a6d36dce5_a-f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-45886ba2-1ae7-38ff-b7e2-4a9a6d36dce5_a-f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/2018-nfl-mock-draft-2-0-qbs-go-1-2-3-sam-darnold-leading-002014627.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C61HJFI_uN3gM26oKExImQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/ee01b2f0-2bd4-11e8-b536-f311d564c66b_darnoldface.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RCNO2EgBLVE2kwo3dFLJNw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04NTM7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/ee01b2f0-2bd4-11e8-b536-f311d564c66b_darnoldface.jpg","height":853,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/ee01b2f0-2bd4-11e8-b536-f311d564c66b_darnoldface.jpg","imgw":1280,"imgh":853,"title":"2018 NFL mock draft 2.0: QBs go 1-2-3 with Sam Darnold leading","summary":"The rush starts with Sam Darnold going to the Browns.","published_at":1521505214,"content_id":"f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/2018-nfl-mock-draft-2-0-qbs-go-1-2-3-sam-darnold-leading-002014627.html","content_published_at":1521505214,"content_time":1521505214,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-266a3062-93e6-3cd6-9905-a16bae158b33_a-4de9fed8-c888-3440-bc8c-bc70836a2755","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/report-competition-committee-proposes-allowing-rqt6gj3","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-competition-committee-proposes-allowing-232708484.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aEsTEA7Uu1RJn8Fwxo8IWQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/d00e6b926f3b2cf75aac73ca88ad3096","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3rWJP5DkKKhFgOTwrfJkdw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNDg7dz01MTk7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/d00e6b926f3b2cf75aac73ca88ad3096","height":348,"width":519,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/d00e6b926f3b2cf75aac73ca88ad3096","imgw":519,"imgh":348,"title":"Report: Competition Committee proposes allowing NFL headquarters to eject players","summary":"Everyone agrees Mike Evans and Rob Gronkowski earned ejections for hits after the whistle last season.

To do so, the Colts agreed only to drop from No. 3 to No. 6 in the first round. According to our official draft abacus, they slip down three spots to net two more picks in the top 49, totaling four in that span. (They also get a 2019 second-round pick.) At first, as usual, this put immediate attention on that No. 3 spot the Colts gave the Jets, with the focus on the annual tradition of somebody moving up to target some specific player, usually a quarterback.

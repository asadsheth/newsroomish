When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel\/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2018 It is unclear whether the memo dated January 29 2018, which was published in full on the New York Times\u2019s website, reflects the thinking of his legal team today.\u00a0 Mr Trump has a times this year seemed open to being interviewed by Mr Mueller in public comments and shook up his legal team in March.\u00a0 At the heart of the letter is the president\u2019s constitutional powers and what the occupant in the Oval Office can and cannot do - boundaries Mr Trump has tested since being elected.\u00a0 Addressing Mr Mueller\u2019s line of inquiry on claims of obstruction of justice, Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers outlined a wide definition of those powers.\u00a0 They wrote: \u201cIt remains our position that the President\u2019s actions here, by virtue of his position as the chief law enforcement officer, could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself, and that he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.\u201d They also rejected a request for an interview, noting: \u201cThe records and testimony we have, pursuant to the President\u2019s directive, already voluntarily provided to your office allow you to delve into the conversations and actions that occurred in a significant and exhaustive manner, including but not limited to the testimony of the President\u2019s interlocutors themselves. In light of these voluntary offerings, your office clearly lacks the requisite need to personally interview the President.\u201d\u00a0 Over the coming months a battle is likely to play out as Mr Mueller weighs up whether to force Mr Trump by a subpoena to give testimony.\u00a0 Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who joined Mr Trump\u2019s legal team in April, has suggested such a move would be unconstitutional.\u00a0 He has also said that Mr Mueller hopes to end the obstruction of justice part of his investigation by September - just three months away.\u00a0 In the letter, Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers argued: \u201cThe President\u2019s prime function as the Chief Executive ought not be hampered by requests for interview. Having him testify demeans the Office of the President before the world.\u201d","published_at":1528046783,"content_id":"d1df44af-8ccc-34b5-8479-50b144367703","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-apos-lawyers-apos-202212777.html","content_published_at":1527970932,"content_time":1527970932,"content_relative_time":46,"reaction_count":13,"vibe_name":"Russia investigation","vibe_id":"2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":46,"comment_relative_time":46,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

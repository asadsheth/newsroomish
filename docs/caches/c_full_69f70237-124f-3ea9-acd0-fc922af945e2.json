The ZANU-PF party congress officially endorsed its Central Committee's decision to replace Mugabe with Emmerson Mnangagwa as its leader, and it endorsed Mnangagwa as its candidate for the 2018 elections. Mnangagwa was inaugurated as the country's new president last month, with the immediate challenge of reviving a shattered economy and removing himself from his longtime mentor's shadow.

Resilience in the world's second-largest economy will likely keep a synchronized global recovery on track for a while longer, even as China faces rising tensions with the United States that could impact billions of dollars in trade. Consumption, which accounted for almost 80 percent of economic growth in the first quarter, played a significant role in supporting the economy even as risks grew for Chinese exporters.","published_at":1523952817,"content_id":"689b37b8-0fed-3ba3-9c99-f898108ded75","content_url":"https:\/\/ca.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/china-first-quarter-gdp-grows-6-8-percent-020329405--business.html","content_published_at":1523960901,"content_time":1523960901,"content_relative_time":7,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":7,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

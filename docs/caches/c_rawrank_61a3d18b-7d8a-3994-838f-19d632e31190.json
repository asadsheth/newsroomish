If there's ever a crossover, Supergirl will come to Freeland, or Green Arrow will come to Freeland. Salim Akil's assured thoughts on Black Lightning's place within The CW's superhero lineup are in line with how the situation has been laid out since the show's development days. It wouldn't have been smart to automatically tether this completely new and refreshingly human superhero story to Arrow, The Flash and the others at that time.","published_at":1523979049,"content_id":"513991c5-5c68-37d8-a97a-2e5c60f740d5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/television\/2404142\/black-lightnings-showrunner-has-strong-words-about-potential-arrow-verse-crossovers","content_published_at":1523978253,"content_time":1523978253,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Media watch","vibe_id":"61a3d18b-7d8a-3994-838f-19d632e31190","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":26,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c398666c-1ceb-32d6-aedb-7660a06daba5","post_id":"v-61a3d18b-7d8a-3994-838f-19d632e31190_c-30457a94-d90e-3b9f-80cc-feb11182ff5c_a-c398666c-1ceb-32d6-aedb-7660a06daba5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-61a3d18b-7d8a-3994-838f-19d632e31190_c-30457a94-d90e-3b9f-80cc-feb11182ff5c_a-c398666c-1ceb-32d6-aedb-7660a06daba5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/media-watch\/fox-friends-downplays-connection-between-qs7nhct","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"theweek.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/theweek.com\/speedreads\/767934\/fox--friends-downplays-connection-between-sean-hannity-michael-cohen-perfectly-logical","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x44goH34mwUIl6.GQIchLA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nMn_EcwnEtFxfj8Fws8ziw--\/dz0xMjYwO2g9NTYwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c398666c-1ceb-32d6-aedb-7660a06daba5-1683282477.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cQfHvU70EGu7rcY02BupDw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NjA7dz0xMjYwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nMn_EcwnEtFxfj8Fws8ziw--\/dz0xMjYwO2g9NTYwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c398666c-1ceb-32d6-aedb-7660a06daba5-1683282477.jpeg","height":560,"width":1260,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nMn_EcwnEtFxfj8Fws8ziw--\/dz0xMjYwO2g9NTYwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c398666c-1ceb-32d6-aedb-7660a06daba5-1683282477.jpeg","imgw":1260,"imgh":560,"title":"Fox & Friends downplays the connection between Sean Hannity and Michael Cohen as 'perfectly logical'","summary":"Things have been a little crazy at the Fox News HQ ever since it was revealed that Michael Cohen's third mystery client is none other than the network's own Sean Hannity. \"Did Hannity disclose his Cohen connection to his bosses?\" wondered CNN's media critic Brian Stelter while Alan Dershowitz told Hannity to his face on Monday night that \"it would have been much, much better had you disclosed that relationship.\" The hosts of Fox & Friends, on the other hand, weren't sure what all the kerfuffle was about. \"It's perfectly logical to think that if you're friendly with somebody, that you might ask them for legal help,\" claimed co-host Brian Kilmeade on Tuesday morning.

The FX series follows David Haller (Dan Stevens), the mutant son of Charles Xavier, who possesses near limitless psychic and telekinetic abilities. David and his allies are attempting to thwart the Shadow King, a monstrously powerful mutant that has taken up residence in David's broken mind since he was a child. The show features some of the most striking imagery on television, and delves into the sort of metaphysical and philosophical territory that comic book television shows don't generally explore.","published_at":1523973828,"content_id":"09cf943f-0f22-3459-8676-a1433d2d192a","content_url":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/shouldnt-worry-legion-canceled\/","content_published_at":1523962626,"content_time":1523962626,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Media

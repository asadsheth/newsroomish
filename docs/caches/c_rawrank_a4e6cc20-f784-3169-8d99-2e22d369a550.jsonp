According to police, an officer was patrolling the area of Vegas Avenue when he came across a gold 1997 Honda Accord, and he ran a routine license-plate check on the vehicle. The lookup determined that the Accord was reported stolen in San Jose, so the officer attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the car. But the Accord sped away, police said, and ran through a stop sign at Arizona Avenue and Dixon Road. Moments later, the fleeing driver lost control, hit a street sign then a tree, and the car became inoperable.

Bay Area actor Brian Rivera will be playing the King of Siam for more than half of the eight performances of \u201cThe King and I\u201d when Broadway San Jose brings director Bartlett Sher's Tony Award-winning 2015 revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to San Jose's Center for the Performing Arts. Rivera has been with the Lincoln Center Theater production since the beginning, as a member of the ensemble and as an understudy for both the King of Siam and the Kralahome, the king's right-hand man. When the touring production began in late 2016 (hitting San Francisco's Golden Gate Theatre that November), Rivera was cast as the Kralahome and continued to understudy the King.","published_at":1519059822,"content_id":"91d0bb7f-c6db-30c0-915b-927b79ce2471","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/02\/19\/this-king-might-look-familiar-to-bay-area-theatergoers\/","content_published_at":1519059647,"content_time":1519059647,"content_relative_time":247,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"San Jose","vibe_id":"a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":247,"comment_relative_time":247,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453","post_id":"v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-cf0f113a-9521-3613-b155-da709e9a08ad_a-5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-cf0f113a-9521-3613-b155-da709e9a08ad_a-5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/san-jose-calif\/v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-cf0f113a-9521-3613-b155-da709e9a08ad_a-5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"reuters.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/icehockey-nhl-sjs-dal-recap\/big-first-period-lets-sharks-sail-past-stars-idUSMTZEE2JDOVEWN","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bBaxKIpfrjy3dmxXL4tX8w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AsQmECEx3T7XGt53z5sAzw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453-1784731982.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Lr5RIo1I2YJsu2KzAmhSVQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AsQmECEx3T7XGt53z5sAzw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453-1784731982.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AsQmECEx3T7XGt53z5sAzw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5e7b6e35-5e1a-3264-830d-66ba6f3dc453-1784731982.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Big first period lets Sharks sail past Stars","summary":"Mikkel Boedker scored twice in the first period as the San Jose Sharks jumped to a huge lead in the opening 17 minutes and cruised to an easy 5-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Sunday at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif.

Clifford Pappadakis, 47, was arrested on suspicion of annoying and molesting a child and possessing child pornography, according to police. Pappadakis worked as a physical education teacher as well as a track and field coach at Willow Glen Middle School, located at 2105 Cottle Ave. The investigation started when parents witnessed Pappadakis taking pictures of female students on Sept. 8. The parents reported the incident to the school.

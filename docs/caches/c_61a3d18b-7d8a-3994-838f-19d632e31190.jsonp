The FX series follows David Haller (Dan Stevens), the mutant son of Charles Xavier, who possesses near limitless psychic and telekinetic abilities. David and his allies are attempting to thwart the Shadow King, a monstrously powerful mutant that has taken up residence in David's broken mind since he was a child. The show features some of the most striking imagery on television, and delves into the sort of metaphysical and philosophical territory that comic book television shows don't generally explore.","published_at":1523973828,"content_id":"09cf943f-0f22-3459-8676-a1433d2d192a","content_url":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/shouldnt-worry-legion-canceled\/","content_published_at":1523962626,"content_time":1523962626,"content_relative_time":33,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Media

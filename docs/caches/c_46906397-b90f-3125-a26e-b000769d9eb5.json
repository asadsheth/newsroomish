SPOILERS for Star Wars: Poe Dameron #26 ahead The latest issue of Marvel's Star Wars: Poe Dameron fills in some of the holes from Poe Dameron's story in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Not only\u00a0does\u00a0Poe Dameron #26 explain\u00a0how he escaped Jakku after his crash landing, but reveals the REAL reason why he let Finn keep his jacket (besides recognizing how good it looked, of course). Up until this point, the Poe Dameron comics have been fleshing out Poe's story before The Force Awakens, following his time as the leader of Black Squadron and working under General Leia Organa as she builds the Resistance.

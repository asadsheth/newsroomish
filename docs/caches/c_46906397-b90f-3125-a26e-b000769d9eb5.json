If you haven\u2019t, this spoiler-filled article probably isn\u2019t going to be for you (and trust us: Episode Eight boasts some jaw-droppingly good moments, all ripe for spoiling). But if you\u2019re up to date with the latest events in a galaxy far, far away, here\u2019s a quick round up of some of the big questions Rian Johnson\u2019s film has left us with.\u00a0 1. What's happened to the Force? Have the rules completely changed?\u00a0 It\u2019s not so much a case of rules being broken, and more a case of existing expectations being blown apart and pre-established boundaries challenged. But either way, in The Last Jedi Johnson is clearly having a blast with the idea of what the Force can and can\u2019t do. There\u2019s a raw physicality to those bridging scenes between Rey and Kylo Ren, for instance, that transcends traditional Force telepathy: a sense of \u201ccrossing over\u201d, opening a window and really reaching through. True, we later learn that the intense bond between the pair has been engineered by Snoke for his own purposes (and it\u2019s not clear exactly how he does this). Without getting too metaphysical, it\u2019s also worth noting that all physical sensations arguably take place in the mind: Rey and Kylo might feel as if they\u2019re being touched, or remotely attacked, without these actions really taking place. But the fact remains that The Force, in this film, feels more potent, more unexpected \u2013 and, given these new developments, more viscerally frightening \u2013 than ever before. 2.\u00a0How can Luke suddenly have the power of astral projection? Well, possibly not anymore, as Luke is now pretty definitely dead (see question nine). But his extended projection scene in The Last Jedi was another example of the way Johnson has pushed his definition of Force powers to the limit, showing us things we\u2019ve never before seen in a Star Wars movie. Interestingly, there is some precedent for these kind of powers in some of the (non-canon) Star Wars comic books. In the series Dark Empire, for instance, Luke is able to create a projected double of himself and use it to fool others \u2013 and, in other stories, it\u2019s established that a kind of astral projection can be used by certain Jedi and Sith, although not that often. But Johnson\u2019s decision to kill Luke off immediately after his ruse \u2013 implying that the effort involved has taken all his strength \u2013 suggests that Luke\u2019s extended accomplishment, in the world of the films, may have been a one-off, never-before-attempted feat. Star Wars | More from The Telegraph 3. Just how powerful is\u00a0Leia? We already know, from previous films, that Leia \u201chas the Force\u201d (You have that power too,\u201d Luke tells her in Return of the Jedi. \u201cIn time you\u2019ll learn to use it\u201d). And yet, because it\u2019s something we\u2019ve not really seen in any detail on the big-screen before, the scene in which the General guides herself back to the safety of her ship, evading an icy death in space, feels incredibly important. Carrie Fisher as Leia Sadly, while we\u2019d normally be speculating about whether we\u2019d be seeing more of Leia\u2019s powers in Episode Nine, the untimely death of Carrie Fisher last year means that this now feels unlikely. Lucasfilm has promised that a resurrected CGI Leia definitely isn\u2019t on the cards \u2013 and plans to focus on the character in the final film will have been adjusted accordingly. 4.\u00a0Are Rey\u2019s parents really \u201cnobodies\u201d? The revelation that Rey\u2019s parents were a pair of heartless nobodies, who callously sold their daughter then met their deaths shortly afterwards, was one of the film\u2019s most brilliantly subversive twists. It\u2019s possible that Kylo may have been lying to Rey, attempting to manipulate her into joining him \u2013 but his revelation that she really did come from nothing had a ring of truth to it.\u00a0Furthermore, in a franchise that has previously traded on secret identities and mystery fathers, the concept that Rey is special just because she\u2019s Rey \u2013 and not because she\u2019s so-and-so\u2019s daughter \u2013 feels oddly affirming. Daisy Ridley as Rey Rey doesn\u2019t need to have a hidden, \u201cchosen one\u201d heritage \u2013 she\u2019s powerful and important in her own right, because of her strength, and her courage, and her resolution. Our private guess, for what it\u2019s worth, is that Kylo was only half-lying: we reckon it\u2019ll turn out that Rey\u2019s parents were indeed nobodies \u2013 but quite nice ones, who always intended to come back for their daughter. This way, she\u2019ll still get some bittersweet emotional resolution, without compromising the important message that a \u201cnobody\u201d can still be a Force-wielding force to be reckoned with. 5.\u00a0Who, exactly,\u00a0was Snoke? And does it matter? And what, we might add, was going on with that gold dressing gown? Terrible look, Snoke. You\u2019re much more intimidating as a giant hologram. In retrospect, of course, the decision to make the Supreme Leader seem weaker \u2013 shrunken, and somehow substantially diminished in grandeur and menace \u2013 in this film was probably all part of Johnson\u2019s plan, building up as it does to the moment in which the former arch-villain makes a fatal miscalculation. Now that he\u2019s been neatly sliced in two, however, all the feverish speculation about his \u201creal\u201d identity\u201d that fans were previously indulging in feels a bit pointless. Andy Serkis as Snoke We imagine the story of Snoke\u2019s past might be explored, someday, in a Star Wars spin-off title. But now that he\u2019s out of the picture, it feels highly unlikely that his background will form a major plot point in Episode Nine \u2013 or that a big, game-changing reveal was ever on the cards. Snoke, safe to say, is nobody\u2019s daddy. 6. Are\u00a0Hux\u2019s days numbered? Ah, poor Hux. Conflicted Kylo might flicker between evil and good, but his space Nazi buddy has always been properly committed to the Dark Side. And yet, despite his appropriately villainous voice and looks \u2013 and infantile lack of temper tantrums \u2013 Hux is now stuck playing second fiddle to Kylo, simmering with resentment while the new Supreme Leader throws out ridiculous, emotionally impulsive orders. Domhnall Gleeson as Hux His barely\u00a0disguised loathing \u2013 and Kylo\u2019s rampant instability \u2013 mean that Hux will probably make a new bid for power and meet his end early on in Episode Nine. We hope, for his sake, he gets to blow up a few planets or something first. 7. Could Rey and Kylo Ren end up switching roles? All this barely\u00a0concealed Force-flirting and reluctant emotional bonding can\u2019t end well, can it? They might share a mysterious connection, but now that Kylo has apparently chosen his path, it feels unlikely that the series has a happy ending in store for him and Rey. The rogue Solo son, furthermore, is also now the main villain of the piece (sorry Hux), meaning that any redemption arc would have to take place pretty late in the game, or risk taking away all the stakes. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren One just-about-plausible twist is that Episode Nine will see Rey explore her own dark side and turn antagonist \u2013 something which was strongly hinted at in her Last Jedi scenes with Luke, in which he sensed her terrifying potential for darkness. Overall, however, it feels as if the franchise, under Johnson\u2019s direction, could be more interested in the idea of finding balance, and carving out a world where the light and dark extremes of the Force must both take backseat. The emergence of a new generation of Force-sensitive characters (as evidenced by that final scene with the little boy) could also play into this. 8. Was there a subtle \u201clet\u2019s be nicer to animals\u201d message at play? If so, it\u2019s a message we\u2019re thoroughly on board with. We had Chewbacca getting guilt-tripped by a sad porg while eating a roasted porg \u2013 I mean really, Chewie: how could you? \u2013 and some surprisingly sympathetic, intelligent-seeming ice crystal foxes, on hand to help the rebellion out of a tight spot. Chewbacca and a porg There was even an apparent anti- animal racing sub plot, courtesy of the casino scenes (take home lesson: whipping things and making them race each other is mean, no matter how glamorous or fun it might look at first). That said, when it comes to sheer pathos, nothing will ever rival the grieving Rancor keeper. 9.\u00a0Is Luke definitely dead? Will he come back as a Force ghost in Episode Nine? We\u2019re going to go out on a limb here and say yes and yes. Body disappearing under a cloak like that? Classic Jedi-who-will-probably-be-a-ghost-death. In case you\u2019re wondering, the standard Star Wars explanation for the ghosts is that certain Jedi, such as Yoda and Obi Wan, have mastered the art of becoming one with the Force at death, while simultaneously maintaining their individuality. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker Previous films and materials suggested that doing this was something that had to be taught \u2013 but, during his years of self-imposed solitude, it\u2019s perfectly plausible that Luke may have come across the technique, or even been schooled in it by ghost-Yoda. Without being too cynical, it also feels likely that Episode Nine will want to maintain a link to at least one of the three veteran actors from the original trilogy. With Harrison Ford\u2019s Han Solo meeting his end in The Force Awakens, and Carrie Fisher tragically passing away in 2016, a future Luke ghost cameo feels like a fairly safe bet. 10.\u00a0\u200bHave the \u201crules\u201d for Force ghosts changed? In previous Star Wars movies, Force ghosts haven\u2019t really been able to do that much. They can turn up to Ewok parties, yes \u2013 but interacting with the real world (or grabbing a slice of barbecued Stormtrooper) always appeared to be out of the question. In The last Jedi, however, Yoda appears to have physical form; he was able to start a fire, gleefully burn some ancient Jedi texts and actively engage with Luke\u2019s surroundings. All suggesting\u00a0that Johnson may have chosen to shake things up a bit, or at least test the rules surrounding the ghosts and their physicality.\u00a0","published_at":1513245501,"content_id":"eb582e4a-7148-342d-a260-f3ad14b1de40","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/star-wars-last-jedi-spoilers-125420446.html","content_published_at":1513256060,"content_time":1513256060,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":6,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"38034560-64b8-31c4-9beb-984064ec04e2","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-738076d3-20c6-3659-9a44-ff43225a1d5c_a-38034560-64b8-31c4-9beb-984064ec04e2","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

Launched this summer, Moviepass costs $10 per month, and lets you watch as many new movie releases as you want. That\u2019s incredibly affordable, and the price dropped even lower than $10 per month a few weeks ago. And now the company has an even better offer for you. MoviePass on Tuesday announced that it partnered with Fandor and Costco to offer buyers a combined yearly subscription for just $89.99. The offer is valid only online at Costco.com, and once you purchase it, you\u2019ll be given codes that activate your one-year MoviePass and Fandor subscriptions. That\u2019s an incredible deal considering that Fandor would typically cost $5 per month. Fandor is a streaming service for independent movies, documentaries, international features, and shorts, and the flat $89.99 package will give you access to all of Fandor\u2019s 5,000+ titles. Even if you don\u2019t care about Fandor, this deal will get you a year worth of MoviePass access for $20 less than what the subscription costs through MoviePass. Don\u2019t look anywhere else for this deal, as Costco is the exclusive seller. Furthermore, the offer is valid from December 12th through December 18th, so you\u2019ll have to hurry. Finally, if you\u2019re looking to give friends and family MoviePass gifts, such an option is available over at MoviePass. But you\u2019d still be better activating a MoviePass subscription for them through Costco.","published_at":1513168761,"content_id":"8a0434a2-e412-327f-9fbd-fb224c5bc6cf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/costco-teamed-moviepass-absurdly-cheap-cinema-subscription-030250817.html","content_published_at":1513134170,"content_time":1513134170,"content_relative_time":40,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":40,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

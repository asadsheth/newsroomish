It's likely the project earned fresh impetus from the plethora of successful Stephen King-inspired projects in 2017, and the plan now is to get this particular remake before the cameras this year. Details, then. Already in place to direct are Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer. Now we learn too that Jason Clarke is to be the first to sign up in front of the camera. He's in talks to play the role of Dr Louis Creed in the movie, the male lead role. The film is on the calendar for release in April 2019. If you're a bit impatient, then it's already been filmed once of course, back in 1989.","published_at":1523955926,"content_id":"c94d64b7-05d3-3f85-bcdc-cd1788a9d43e","content_url":"http:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\/uk\/movies\/pet-sematary\/56915\/pet-sematary-remake-lands-jason-clarke","content_published_at":1523948400,"content_time":1523948400,"content_relative_time":36,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":36,"comment_relative_time":36,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d985c191-b60d-3410-b330-ed5cf5183cec","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-f357da98-06fd-3e04-8726-49b6bae9e666_a-d985c191-b60d-3410-b330-ed5cf5183cec","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-f357da98-06fd-3e04-8726-49b6bae9e666_a-d985c191-b60d-3410-b330-ed5cf5183cec","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/domhnall-gleeson-join-kitchen-492at4b","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Advocate","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.theadvocate.com\/baton_rouge\/entertainment_life\/article_ee75c66e-5a3a-58aa-991c-ee178073176f.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7xts18ClO__YOeFioSzEOA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yHM7MbWEA8q2DPjwy6Na4Q--\/dz05Njk7aD02MzA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d985c191-b60d-3410-b330-ed5cf5183cec--955882047.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FjMiKLo0nOsUb0PCxNOAjA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz05Njk7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yHM7MbWEA8q2DPjwy6Na4Q--\/dz05Njk7aD02MzA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d985c191-b60d-3410-b330-ed5cf5183cec--955882047.jpeg","height":630,"width":969,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yHM7MbWEA8q2DPjwy6Na4Q--\/dz05Njk7aD02MzA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d985c191-b60d-3410-b330-ed5cf5183cec--955882047.jpeg","imgw":969,"imgh":630,"title":"Domhnall Gleeson to join The Kitchen","summary":"Domhnall Gleeson is in talks to join the cast of 'The Kitchen'.

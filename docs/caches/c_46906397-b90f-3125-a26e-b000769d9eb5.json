Starting as a spiritual successor to Point Break in 2001, the franchise has grown from a grounded and gritty street-level crime thriller in The Fast and the Furious to a global espionage blockbuster franchise in 2017's The Fate of the Furious. It's a change that has not gone unnoticed by original Fast and Furious director Rob Cohen, and the filmmaker recently opened up in an interview and explained that he's just happy to see original characters remain at the heart of the enhanced spectacle. The franchise went from a Los Angeles story built around a family of multicultural brothers and sisters to what I'll call 'pure spectacle.' The beauty is that the audience has ridden along with it for these 18 years.","published_at":1520378270,"content_id":"9fe5a2e0-dae7-386b-8da9-19e517a772a5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2383202\/what-the-original-fast-and-furious-director-thinks-of-the-franchise-now","content_published_at":1520371522,"content_time":1520371522,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1e4a0cda-e903-3fd4-8161-6570aed2b0c3","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-53f1c710-b5c3-3be0-95f5-50fb05fd019b_a-1e4a0cda-e903-3fd4-8161-6570aed2b0c3","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-53f1c710-b5c3-3be0-95f5-50fb05fd019b_a-1e4a0cda-e903-3fd4-8161-6570aed2b0c3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/predicting-marvels-phase-4-movies-28vxyfu","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"CINEMABLEND","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2383112\/predicting-marvels-phase-4-movies-knowing-only-the-release-dates","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TZAND_0LF5KFNx1TPrie5g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/UKPmR7StgXtjxS7W1eOBzA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1e4a0cda-e903-3fd4-8161-6570aed2b0c3-1475830674.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cn672qqO9ljc2SAymH7X_w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/UKPmR7StgXtjxS7W1eOBzA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1e4a0cda-e903-3fd4-8161-6570aed2b0c3-1475830674.jpeg","height":300,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/UKPmR7StgXtjxS7W1eOBzA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1e4a0cda-e903-3fd4-8161-6570aed2b0c3-1475830674.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":300,"title":"Predicting Marvel's Phase 4 Movies, Knowing Only The Release Dates","summary":"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Release Date: 7\/31\/20 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the only Phase 4 movie that's but talked about in any definitive terms, with James Gunn returning to write and direct the third movie in one of Marvel's top franchises. We know that the movie is aiming for a 2020 release date, but not the specific date. While Guardians is big enough to open in May (which usually has a high-tier Marvel movie), opening in July isn't a bad spot. Seeing as how Vol. 3 is likely further along in the development process than other projects, it'll hit theaters sooner rather than later.

Maisie Sly, the profoundly deaf girl from Swindon who brought sign language to the Oscars","summary":"This year\u2019s Oscars were a subdued affair after months of depressing news from sexual harassment in the entertainment industry. Hollywood, and its onlookers, was certainly in need of a wholesome good news story. But one star cut through the gloom: six-year-old Maisie Sly, a deaf girl from Swindon who was behind the ceremony\u2019s most touching moment. Rachel Shenton, writer and actress of 2017 film The Silent Child, signed her acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film Oscar so that Sly could understand it. \u201cOur movie is about a deaf child being born into a world of silence,\u201d Shenton explained, with shaking hands. It's not exaggerated or sensationalised, this is happening: millions of children all over the world live in silence and face communication barriers, particularly in access to education.\" Hours earlier, Sly dazzled as the littlest person on the red carpet in a smart midnight blue dress, a matching bow across her blonde hair, arriving at the 90th Academy Awards\u00a0hand-in-hand with Shenton and her fiance, Chris Overton, who directed the film. Sly was five when she played Libby, a four-year-old who was born into a hearing family. Libby\u2019s parents and siblings are a normal family, but unwittingly shut out their deaf daughter, who spent her early years in confounding silence. After remaining undiagnosed for three-and-a-half years, audiences watch as an angry and introverted Libby is coaxed out of herself after a social worker, Joanne (played by Shenton) is brought in to teach her British Sign Language. Fortunately, Sly\u2019s own story differs greatly: both her parents are deaf, as is her older brother Jack, eight, and little sister Chloe. Like her siblings, Sly learned BSL from infancy. But for her father, Gibson, Libby\u2019s experiences are all too relatable. He was also born to a hearing family and wasn\u2019t diagnosed until he was three. He later attended a mainstream primary school. \u201cI was lonely, frustrated and rebellious,\u201d he told the Swindon Advertiser last year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I met Elizabeth and learned BSL that I found my deaf identity.\u201d As Shenton said, the problem of deaf integration is widespread. Every week 34 babies are born deaf in the UK, and 90 per cent of them have hearing parents. \u201cThe Silent Child shines a light on the challenges and injustices that too many deaf children experience as part of their daily lives,\u201d Susan Daniels, Chief Executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, told The Telegraph. The whole Sly family accompanied the six-year-old to Los Angeles for Sunday night\u2019s ceremony. It is her second trip to America in the past 12 months, after Sly made her maiden voyage over the Atlantic to see the film premiere at the Rhode Island International Film Festival during her summer holidays. Sly won Best Actress at the festival, which made The Silent Child eligible to enter the Oscars. The film\u2019s Facebook page shows how the family have been enjoying Los Angeles\u2019 landmarks over the past two weeks, with trips to Universal Studios, the Los Angeles Zoo and a stroll down Hollywood Walk of Fame. Sly and Shenton in The Silent Child It\u2019s all a rapid change for the \u201cbubbly\u201d schoolgirl, who attends Red Oaks Primary School \u2013 which is a mainstream school with a special resource provision for deaf children \u2013 near her home of Upper Stratton. \u201cShe\u2019s a lovely girl,\u201d said headteacher Rachel Surch. \u201cShe\u2019s a real character, with lots of personality and lots of friends. Just like our other deaf children, she fits right in with her mainstream friends - being deaf doesn\u2019t hold her back, nor should it.\u201d Red Oaks celebrated The Silent Child by hosting a red carpet premiere for its pupils in the school hall. Speaking the morning after the film\u2019s Oscar win, Surch said it had \u201cbeen a bit of a whirlwind\u201d. Sly was part of a nationwide casting search for The Silent Child, and auditioned after her parents saw an advert on Facebook looking for a four- or five-year-old girl who was profoundly deaf and used sign language. Shenton said that 100 children auditioned, but she and the production team knew Sly was their star instantly. \"Maisie walked in and we all say, all our production team, that we made our decision within 10 seconds, she was just perfect,\" she told Good Morning Britain. The Oscar-winner fell in love with British Sign Language during her teens, after her father lost his hearing as a result of undergoing chemotherapy. He spent the last two years of his life deaf, and died when Shenton was 14. She was driven to juggle her nascent acting career \u2013 which included roles in TV dramas such as Holby City and Waterloo Road \u2013 with volunteering as a BSL interpreter and working with a local charity for deaf people. The stories of people she met inspired her to write The Silent Child, especially those of middle-class families who were left dumbfounded upon having a deaf child. Sly has now joined the ranks of Marlee Matlin, who became the first deaf actress \u2013 and the youngest women ever \u2013 to win Best Actress at the 1986 Oscars for Children of a Lesser God. \u201cShe is a confident, happy little girl and maybe she could be the next Matlin,\u201d Gibson said last May. \u201cBut we do know that acting opportunity for a deaf girl are few and far between.\u201d The Silent Child writer and star Rachel Shenton, actress Maisie Sly and director Chris Overton Credit: \u00a0CARLO ALLEGRI The lack of deaf actors on screen was another major motivation for Shenton to make The Silent Child: \u201cI\u2019ve seen numerous projects where hearing people are cast to play deaf roles,\u201d she said on Good Morning Britain. The problem has frequently found the silver screen, such as when Tammy Blanchard played the wife of Matt Damon\u2019s character in The Good Shepherd (2006), or James Stewart\u2019s role as the deaf George Bailey in It\u2019s A Wonderful Life. But change could be on the horizon. October will see the release of Wonderstruck, Todd Haynes\u2019 adaptation of Brian Selznick\u2019s time-travelling coming of age novel, which sees 14-year-old deaf actress Millie Simmonds take a major part. After Sly\u2019s success, who knows which other deaf children may be inspired to follow her lead. As Daniels says: \u201cFor deaf children across the globe, this film, its story, and its talented leading lady all show there is no limit to what deaf children can achieve.\u201d","published_at":1520399175,"content_id":"bc7656d6-8ac9-3a20-b6f8-c2ee33fe074c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/oscars-shine-light-maisie-profoundly-084740427.html","content_published_at":1520264475,"content_time":1520264475,"content_relative_time":55,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":55,"comment_relative_time":55,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"170a726d-3d24-3423-9df8-6b8f0a40d648","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-18d511cf-9164-3139-9ed7-5dc1699203b3_a-170a726d-3d24-3423-9df8-6b8f0a40d648","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-18d511cf-9164-3139-9ed7-5dc1699203b3_a-170a726d-3d24-3423-9df8-6b8f0a40d648","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/nascars-richard-petty-auctioning-off-2vovv8f","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"WJZY","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.fox46charlotte.com\/sports\/nascars-richard-petty-is-auctioning-off-cars-and-memorabilia-from-his-racing-career","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"NASCAR's Richard Petty is auctioning off cars and memorabilia from his racing career","summary":"(FOX NEWS) - \u201cThe King\u201d is cleaning out his closet.

The British actor is hotly tipped to be named best actor for his role in The Darkest Hour, which depicts the early days of Churchill\u2019s rule\u00a0as the Nazis swept across Europe and threatened the United Kingdom. Yet, speaking to The Telegraph\u00a0at an event to celebrate British film, Oldman, 59, was philosophical about his chances. \u201cSunday will be, what Sunday will be,\u201d he said, with a wry smile. Ladbrokes make Oldman the favourite at 1\/25, with fellow Briton Daniel Kaluuya, nominated for Get Out, at 16 to one \u2013 equal with Timothee Chalamet for Call Me By Your Name. Daniel Day-Lewis, already the most successful lead actor in Oscars history, with three best actor awards, is 25 to one for his swansong, Phantom Thread. Denzel Washington is considered the outsider for Roman J. Israel Esq, with Ladbrokes rating him a 100 to one shot. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Oldman wins, he will be the first Briton named best actor since Eddie Redmayne, who won three years ago for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Defeating Day-Lewis - a fellow\u00a0Londoner\u00a0who rose\u00a0through the British theatre scene alongside Oldman - would be the crowning moment in a dazzlingly diverse 35-year career. \u201cChurchill has been such fabulous company,\u201d Oldman said, sipping his coffee. The actor has been teetotal since a well-publicised battle with alcohol in the 1990s. Oscars 2018 Full list of nominees \u201cI\u2019m so glad there has been such support for it, and interest in it. And that the Churchill family has embraced it.\u201d Randolph Churchill, the great-great grandson of the prime minister, heaped praise on Oldman, as well as Kristin Scott Thomas, as Churchill\u2019s wife, and Ben Mendelsohn, who plays King George VI. \u201cWe\u2019re always a little bit nervous about these ventures,\u201d he said last month. \u201cBut I can say wholeheartedly, Gary, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben have absolutely done us so proud.\u201d \u00a0The film is up for six awards, including best picture. Dunkirk, its fellow Second World War tale, is nominated for eight. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d Mr Churchill said. \u201cGary absolutely nailed it.\u201d","published_at":1520253374,"content_id":"9f6427c1-3515-35a2-a6eb-6419507e1501","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gary-oldman-says-playing-winston-090649030.html","content_published_at":1520068009,"content_time":1520068009,"content_relative_time":109,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":109,"comment_relative_time":109,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e9629902-2599-3982-981a-aada12cbace6","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-fc98d6c1-112b-3b4f-838a-d852197204ec_a-e9629902-2599-3982-981a-aada12cbace6","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-fc98d6c1-112b-3b4f-838a-d852197204ec_a-e9629902-2599-3982-981a-aada12cbace6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/box-office-black-panther-now-4h5qb6m","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/scottmendelson\/2018\/03\/03\/box-office-black-panther-now-between-dark-knight-rises-and-avengers-age-of-ultron\/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Box Office: 'Black Panther' Now Between 'Dark Knight Rises' And 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron'","summary":"'Black Panther' will be the first MCU flick to top the weekend box office three times since 'The Avengers'.","published_at":1520352085,"content_id":"e9629902-2599-3982-981a-aada12cbace6","content_url":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/scottmendelson\/2018\/03\/03\/box-office-black-panther-now-between-dark-knight-rises-and-avengers-age-of-ultron\/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1520089200,"content_time":1520089200,"content_relative_time":103,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":103,"comment_relative_time":103,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"14c53a13-2b22-3809-b675-ce78b4dfd441","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-116df1fb-beee-352a-872a-a2b57bad8264_a-14c53a13-2b22-3809-b675-ce78b4dfd441","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-116df1fb-beee-352a-872a-a2b57bad8264_a-14c53a13-2b22-3809-b675-ce78b4dfd441","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-116df1fb-beee-352a-872a-a2b57bad8264_a-14c53a13-2b22-3809-b675-ce78b4dfd441","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Movies UK","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.movies.yahoo.com\/oscars-2018-roger-deakins-ends-oscar-hoodoo-blade-runner-2049-win-063011950.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TzM3kmSsCqJZMycswbMnCg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f1a91841a76afd63afaa500fa571f568","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RiqPNGOuspSxQbDoAnJ4hQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDU2O3c9MzY5Njs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f1a91841a76afd63afaa500fa571f568","height":2456,"width":3696,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f1a91841a76afd63afaa500fa571f568","imgw":3696,"imgh":2456,"title":"Oscars 2018: Roger Deakins ends Oscar hoodoo with 'Blade Runner 2049' win","summary":"Roger Deakins finally snagged an Oscar after 14 nominations.","published_at":1520278229,"content_id":"14c53a13-2b22-3809-b675-ce78b4dfd441","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.movies.yahoo.com\/oscars-2018-roger-deakins-ends-oscar-hoodoo-blade-runner-2049-win-063011950.html","content_published_at":1520231411,"content_time":1520231411,"content_relative_time":64,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":64,"comment_relative_time":64,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

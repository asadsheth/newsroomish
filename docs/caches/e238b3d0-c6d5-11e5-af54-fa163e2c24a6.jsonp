After the Boston Celtics dropped Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals 111-102 to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night, Boston now finds the series tied at two heading back to TD Garden for a crucial Game 5. But Stevens didn't feel like his young team needed a big pep talk after their Game 4 loss. Instead, the head coach gave his squad a simple message. Well said. Boston's young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown echoed Stevens' message after the loss as well. The Celtics now are 1-6 on the road in the playoffs, but will head back to TD Garden for Game 5 where they will need to find a way to slow down LeBron James.

The Cavaliers sharpshooter dropped 14 first-half points on 4 of 4 shooting, which catapulted Korver atop Twitter's U.S. trending topics. As much of the internet enjoyed Korver's agelessness, it also brought the source of Korver's agelessness into relevance.

Ahead of Game 4 in Cleveland, LeBron threw down a thunderous dunk off a bouncing lob to himself. LeBron nearly took off from beyond the paint and made the entire dunk look easy. But the sequence did seem strikingly similar to the dunk that LeBron Jr. attempted over the weekend. Take a look: Bronny is getting there.

Despite the urging of \u201cone more year \u2026 one more year\u201d from the fans, Smith knew he would never suit up again for the Terps after the season ended. The NBA beckoned, and Smith was about to become the No. 1 plck in that June's draft.

While both players used to play with each other, it's clear now that the two stars could not coexist well enough for their partnership to last. Now playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, Thomas teamed up with James for a short while with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Initially, many believed that the two would thrive together. However, in the 14 games that Thomas played, he struggled mightily on the court. Granted, Thomas was still trying to recover from his injury and adapt to a new system, but his defensive inefficiencies were exposed and opponents kept on attacking the hapless\u00a0Thomas.","published_at":1520928624,"content_id":"e73803be-1906-3f12-80b5-c734dca8fc0e","content_url":"https:\/\/clutchpoints.com\/lakers-video-isaiah-thomas-lebron-james-exchange-pleasantries\/","content_published_at":1520744400,"content_time":1520744400,"content_relative_time":66,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-e073c8bf-7a75-342f-b034-8c8becec772d_a-24ff763a-3c11-35e8-bf57-1882069ff046","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/could-cavs-sign-kendrick-perkins-2i8lsor","author":"third_watch","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/lebronwire.usatoday.com\/2018\/03\/12\/could-the-cavs-sign-kendrick-perkins-as-a-coach-to-avoid-adding-to-tax\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Xu.wS.4opIPrlY..klplBw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9b6cVgW_szJKFQwPT21OnQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_24ff763a-3c11-35e8-bf57-1882069ff046--527489136.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sVKOCkVA4RS.ZozD19gCkQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9b6cVgW_szJKFQwPT21OnQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_24ff763a-3c11-35e8-bf57-1882069ff046--527489136.jpeg","height":576,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9b6cVgW_szJKFQwPT21OnQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_24ff763a-3c11-35e8-bf57-1882069ff046--527489136.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":576,"title":"Could the Cavs sign Kendrick Perkins as a coach to avoid adding to tax?","summary":"The Cleveland Cavaliers are a beaten up bunch. In addition to already dealing with injuries to Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson, Cedi Osman and Rodney Hood both went down to injury over Cleveland's weekend in Los Angeles. They're running thin on bodies and with two empty roster spots, it could beg the question, should they sign somebody? With an already large luxury tax bill, signing a player now would cost much more than the simple veteran minimum deal for the rest of the season. The Athletic's Jason Lloyd discussed that possibility in his final thoughts from Sunday's game and offered an interesting alternative: bringing Kendrick Perkins to the team as a coach rather than signing him as a

(AP) -- Khris Middleton scored 24 points, Giannis Antetokounmpo added 20 and the Milwaukee Bucks sent the Memphis Grizzlies to their 18th consecutive loss with a 121-103 victory on Monday night. Brandon Jennings, signed to a 10-day contract by Milwaukee on Saturday, finished two rebounds short of a triple-double with 16 points and 12 assists. Eric Bledsoe added 14 points, including a trio of baskets to stem a fourth-quarter Memphis rally. Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 17 points, while Jarell Martin, Dillon Brooks and Ben McLemore scored 16 apiece. Memphis, which trailed by as many as 19 in the third quarter, used its bench to push back into the game in the fourth.

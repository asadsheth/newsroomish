Put together by then-general manager Jerry West, that trio would ultimately lead the Lakers to three championships in four NBA Finals appearances.

Who could forget about Stephenson's antics during the 2014 playoffs against LeBron James' Heat? (Most notably, when Stephenson blew into LeBron James' ear and became an all-time great meme). Jason Terry didn't forget. During Monday's game against the Pacers, the Bucks guard knocked down a corner 3 right over Stephenson to talk trash. As the two made their way back up court, Terry turned to Stephenson and appeared to blow into Stephenson's ear. And another look: It's tough to say for sure, but he certainly appeared to give Lance his own treatment. Oddly enough, the Pacers forward wasn't too happy about it.","published_at":1520301769,"content_id":"48f7f56a-c591-3061-bc5b-6efce9193219","content_url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/ftw\/2018\/03\/05\/jason-terry-appeared-to-blow-into-lance-stephensons-ear-after-a-made-3\/111128990\/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycomnba-topstories","content_published_at":1520302364,"content_time":1520302364,"content_relative_time":42,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-f9276559-6608-3ceb-8de3-e5cfaf31ded2_a-624b72fa-3bbc-322d-84b5-dedfc683673f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/tight-western-conference-race-may-5n5fmfv","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Mercury News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/03\/05\/tight-western-conference-race-may-throw-things-off-for-warriors-scouts\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OZx5xacT0UI7zoniu9p7kQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LUOXojWi4cVUMK0hIAsC2w--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NjgzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_624b72fa-3bbc-322d-84b5-dedfc683673f--1107797475.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lGzGCXcIHwu383qi1oHDDw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LUOXojWi4cVUMK0hIAsC2w--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NjgzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_624b72fa-3bbc-322d-84b5-dedfc683673f--1107797475.jpeg","height":683,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LUOXojWi4cVUMK0hIAsC2w--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NjgzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_624b72fa-3bbc-322d-84b5-dedfc683673f--1107797475.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":683,"title":"Tight Western Conference race may throw things off for Warriors scouts","summary":"There's still a lot of basketball left to be played but, as of right now, the Western Conference is in an incredibly tight race for playoff seeding.

Butler, of course, went down clutching his knee and was lost for the coming weeks because of a partially torn meniscus cartilage that required surgery less than two days later. One night after a 34-point, 17-point game at Portland, Towns was gone from Friday's game with 23 seconds left in the first half after referees called him for two technical fouls in the final minute of the second quarter and he was ejected for the first time in his career.

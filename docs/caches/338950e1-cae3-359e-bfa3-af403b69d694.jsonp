Sanofi said on Monday it would pay 45 euros per share in cash for Ablynx, a premium of 21 percent over its closing price on Friday, and more than double the price before Novo went public with its initial bid.","published_at":1517244383,"content_id":"f14b5faf-b3bf-3980-adc8-bd2d23ede58f","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/frances-sanofi-buys-ablynx-4-8-billion-biotech-090700604--finance.html","content_published_at":1517246088,"content_time":1517246088,"content_relative_time":1,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-ad1c8538-f419-30be-909d-3902141dc88d_a-1d19d25d-6612-3252-b001-5222bb9bcce7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/yahoo-finances-morning-rundown-january-2mstr84","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Yahoo Finance Video","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/yahoo-finances-morning-rundown-january-132557214.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IObmHfIGDBv88RMhvg54AA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-119260-1517232249171.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Hz9ZIozjllY6SULsr0hfA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjgwO3c9NzIwOw--\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-119260-1517232249171.jpg","height":1280,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-119260-1517232249171.jpg","imgw":720,"imgh":1280,"title":"Yahoo Finance's Morning Rundown, January 29","summary":null,"published_at":1517237628,"content_id":"1d19d25d-6612-3252-b001-5222bb9bcce7","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/yahoo-finances-morning-rundown-january-132557214.html","content_published_at":1517232357,"content_time":1517232357,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694","content_type":"video_link","aspect":0.56},{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-28c87cd5-1158-3332-abd6-65fb1c5a0104_a-a572a3ad-15d9-36d8-958c-7b03aa6a29ce","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/u-consumer-spending-rises-savings-5ho4xn6","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/u-consumer-spending-rises-savings-134046394.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"U.S. consumer spending rises; savings drop to 10-year low","summary":"U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in December as demand for goods and services increased, but the gain came at the expense of savings, which dropped to a 10-year low in a troubling sign for future consumption and economic growth.

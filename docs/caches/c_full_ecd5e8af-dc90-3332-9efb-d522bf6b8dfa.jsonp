Trump and his lawyers are trying to set up the milestone on Thursday as a turning point in their campaign to end Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian election meddling and obstruction of justice, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, said Tuesday in an interview. While he isn\u2019t threatening specific actions, Giuliani said they haven\u2019t ruled out additional steps if Mueller doesn\u2019t heed their calls.","published_at":1526416558,"content_id":"f4b83d53-563c-3fd1-ad74-b1ea6f699c75","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-one-mueller-anniversary-blast-203558667.html","content_published_at":1526416558,"content_time":1526416558,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":3,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":6,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

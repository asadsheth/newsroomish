It was a convenient and clever narrative, which worked only insofar as one ignored the regime's responsibility for the majority of damaged or destroyed churches in Syria; its arrest, torture, and murder of Christian anti-regime activists; and its well-documented history of conniving with the very jihadis from which it now claims to be protecting vulnerable adherents of the Gospels. The Daily Beast has learned that the Russian government recently tried to dupe Pope Francis into lending his imprimatur to a similar propaganda stunt, this one designed to lower the temperature on U.S.-Russian hostilities in Syria under the fraternal guise of interdenominational solidarity.","published_at":1526894882,"content_id":"2fbffc9c-5304-3c72-a064-a107d6227b99","content_url":"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/putins-people-claimed-pope-francis-was-with-them-supporting-assad-nope?source=articles&via=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29","content_published_at":1526894323,"content_time":1526894323,"content_relative_time":7,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"U.S.-Russia relations","vibe_id":"bad81b5f-db87-38f1-ad4e-b7e8e737f190","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":7,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b7f1b9df-5fd4-3895-80a3-d30b727f5f01","post_id":"v-bad81b5f-db87-38f1-ad4e-b7e8e737f190_c-4f9177ce-27a6-34f0-b447-4a958792819b_a-b7f1b9df-5fd4-3895-80a3-d30b727f5f01","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-bad81b5f-db87-38f1-ad4e-b7e8e737f190_c-4f9177ce-27a6-34f0-b447-4a958792819b_a-b7f1b9df-5fd4-3895-80a3-d30b727f5f01","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/us-russia-relations\/u-k-lawmakers-urge-curbs-1c0syvp","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Bloomberg","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/?cmpid=yhoo.logo","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/08\/bloomberg-106x27_102102.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/u-k-lawmakers-urge-curbs-083925950.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ijy47wnULHrGFZ0Cq.8deA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/7cc053eb77803ae6e31a014c2d91702a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OdvcdXL6o7wW.vg8gt1PZg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/7cc053eb77803ae6e31a014c2d91702a","height":800,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/7cc053eb77803ae6e31a014c2d91702a","imgw":1200,"imgh":800,"title":"U.K. Lawmakers Urge Curbs on Russia Sovereign Debt, Share Sales","summary":"The U.K. should seek European Union action to bar Russian sovereign debt from clearing houses and work with allies to stop companies whose owners have links to President Vladimir Putin from listing on global stock markets, according to a committee of lawmakers in London. \u201cT\ufeffhe Government should work with the EU, and with the U.S., to prohibit the purchase of bonds in which a sanctioned entity has acted as book runner,\u201d the U.K. Foreign Affairs Select Committee concluded in a non-binding report published Monday.

Unlike the rest of the world, which commemorates the liberation of Europe from Nazi tyranny on May 8, the Kremlin has chosen to exploit the event for its own political advantage as a morbid revanchist glorification of Soviet power on May 9. In crypto-Soviet fashion, the Russian embassies and consulates organize parades and ceremonies that deify the Red Army combatants, the KGB and Stalin himself. Young children are dressed in Red Army and KGB uniforms tailored just for their juvenile figures to emulate Stalin's soldiers.

The show, which opens on Tuesday, has become so desperate for backers that it has allowed a Russian bank set up by an oligarch who is currently subject to sanctions to sponsor a garden this year. VTB Capital, the investment banking arm of the state-controlled VTB Group, is sponsoring the Spirit of Cornwall garden. Andrey Kostin, 61, president and chairman of its sister company, VTB Bank, was one of the Russian businessmen sanctioned by America last month.

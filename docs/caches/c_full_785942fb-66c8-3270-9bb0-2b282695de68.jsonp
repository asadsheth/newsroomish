According to our readers, that elusive fourth win is likely to elude Levine in the current season 14. They think that he and Shelton have far weaker teams than returning coach Alicia Keys and rookie Kelly Clarkson heading into the knockout round, which kicks off on April 2. Levine's eight artists earned a combined 13 chair turns during the blind auditions. He chose six of these during the blind auditions while the other two were steals from coaches who went with the competing artists in the battle round.

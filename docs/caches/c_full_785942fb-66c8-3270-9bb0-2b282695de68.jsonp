One of the new characters shown in the opening credits is Roseanne's grandson Mark (Ames McNamara), who is gender nonconforming and dresses in clothes that are more traditionally worn by girls. It has also been revealed that the reboot will be more political than the original series, with the Conner family divided in the wake of Donald Trump's election.","published_at":1521113229,"content_id":"ea92aa4a-6a40-3d21-88da-70bb9bbb4c13","content_url":"http:\/\/www.goodhousekeeping.com\/life\/entertainment\/news\/a48158\/roseanne-reboot-credits\/","content_published_at":1521062760,"content_time":1521062760,"content_relative_time":45,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"TV buzz","vibe_id":"785942fb-66c8-3270-9bb0-2b282695de68","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":45,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8e1c91a0-37bf-3323-98eb-c476f109a435","post_id":"v-785942fb-66c8-3270-9bb0-2b282695de68_c-cee4336a-4771-3ebc-aa5e-cfcc553f3bc4_a-8e1c91a0-37bf-3323-98eb-c476f109a435","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-785942fb-66c8-3270-9bb0-2b282695de68_c-cee4336a-4771-3ebc-aa5e-cfcc553f3bc4_a-8e1c91a0-37bf-3323-98eb-c476f109a435","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/tv-buzz\/rose-leslie-knows-exactly-deal-3cu3d50","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Mashable","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/feeds.mashable.com\/~r\/Mashable\/~3\/_ldkCkKrHFA\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Rose Leslie knows exactly how to deal with 'Game of Thrones' spoilers from Kit Harington","summary":"Rose Leslie is in a position that many Game of Thrones fans would kill to be in.

on TV tonight:\u00a0Pilgrimage: the Road to Santiago and\u00a0Irish Music Night","summary":"Pilgrimage: the Road to Santiago BBC Two, 9.00pm; not Scotland Another week, another series about a group of celebrities bonding over an unusual experience. Pilgrimage, however, has rather more potential than the standard fare as our group \u2013 actor Neil Morrissey, entertainer Debbie McGee, singer Heather Small, comedian Ed Byrne, Panorama reporter Raphael Rowe, TV presenter and Invictus Games medallist JJ Chalmers and priest Kate Bottley \u2013 have volunteered to walk 800 km of the Camino de Santiago from the French Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, north-western Spain.\u00a0 Each participant has their own reason for taking part: while Rowe, jailed as a teenager in a notorious miscarriage of justice, sees it as a way of coming to terms with his past, Byrne, an experienced walker, clearly just fancies the chance to stretch himself. It makes for a fascinating mix and there are some entertaining moments: \u201cHills are my nemesis,\u201d admits the laid-back Morrissey, while an emotional Bottley raises eyebrows by stating that she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d have to do the walk for real. Yet it\u2019s the quieter bonding moments that really stand out as Rowe and Bottley discuss her faith and his lack of it, and Chalmers and McGee talk about those they\u2019ve loved and lost. Sarah Hughes On My Block Netflix, from today\u00a0 Netflix attempts to corner the teenage comedy market with this warm new 10-part series from Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft (who wrote for Empire) and Lauren Iungerich (showrunner of MTV high-school series Awkward). The premise is tried and tested \u2013 socially awkward youngsters negotiate high school \u2013 but the South Central, Los Angeles setting feels fresh. SH Irish Music Night BBC Four, from 8.00pm\u00a0 On the eve of St Patrick\u2019s Day, BBC Four celebrates Irish music. At 8.00pm Songs of Ireland sees musicians including multi-instrumental folk star Finbar Furey performing at Glasgow\u2019s Royal Concert Hall. That\u2019s followed by The Irish Rock Story: A Tale of Two Cities, Mike Connolly\u2019s excellent 2015 film about Belfast and Dublin\u2019s influences on Irish rock music. The 2012 film, Here Comes the Summer: The Undertones Story, is at 10.00pm, and at 11.00pm is a recording of Irishman Van Morrison\u2019s 2017 concert at the Eden Project. SH Scruffts: Britain\u2019s Favourite Dog Channel 4, 8.00pm Which dog will win the coveted Scruffts Family Crossbreed Dog of the Year title? Alan Carr looks at the semi-finalists, including Staffordshire Bull Terrier\/Whippet cross Honey, who assists clinical psychologist Emma with her mental health work to Milo, an Anatolian Shepherd\/German Shepherd cross, rescued by owner Charley as a malnourished puppy. SH Gardeners\u2019 World BBC Two, 8.30pm; not Scotland It\u2019s never too early to start planning for the summer harvest and this week\u2019s episode has a fruity focus as Monty Don looks at adding to his crop. Elsewhere, Joe Swift advises on how to brighten up even the dullest of spaces. SH Requiem BBC One, 9.00pm Those who have stuck with Kris Mrksa\u2019s interesting if flawed attempt to meld horror and crime are rewarded with an enjoyably spooky ending as Matilda (Lydia Wilson) attempts to solve the mystery of Carys\u2019s disappearance. SH The Young Offenders BBC One, 10.35pm; NI, 11.05pm; not Wales The joy of Peter Foott\u2019s comedy lies in the warmth that imbues this tale of two hapless, occasionally criminal teenagers. Tonight\u2019s finale see Jock (Chris Walley) impersonate Billy Murphy (Shane Casey), a man who doesn\u2019t take lightly to such crimes. SH I, Robot (2004)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 E4, 8.00pm We\u2019re in Chicago, 2035, and a robot-hating cop (Will Smith) must quell an uprising by the city\u2019s robot servants. Inspired by the stories in Isaac Asimov\u2019s anthology of the same name, this sci-fi thriller is hectic, light and fairly amusing, although \u2013 especially at the beginning \u2013 the camera has an irksome habit of lingering on certain heavily branded consumer items (trainers, hi-fi equipment) that aren\u2019t central to the action. Hilary and Jackie (1998)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 London Live, 10.00pm This true-to-life blockbuster about British cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 and her stormy relationship with her sister met with controversy on its release for delving into private lives of real people. It earned plaudits and Oscar nominations for Emily Watson as Jackie and Rachel Griffiths as her sister Hilary, but despite fine acting from the two female leads, it seems both tackier and tamer in the biopic-obsessed 21st century. Firefox (1982)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ITV4, 10.05pm This techno-thriller is based on a novel by Craig Thomas and on the creation of a fictional super fighter: the MiG-31 Firefox. Clint Eastwood (who also directs) plays a Vietnam veteran, Major Mitchell Gant, who has to steal the revolutionary Russian jet. It\u2019s hard going for even the most dedicated of fans, but Atari later made it into a successful video game. Warren Clarke and Freddie Jones (father of Toby) co-star. SATURDAY 17 MARCH Winged Bull in the Elephant Case, directed by Robin Friend and Wayne McGregor Performance Live:\u00a0Winged Bull in the Elephant Case BBC Two, 10.40pm; N Ireland and Scotland, 11.40pm The latest film in the BBC\u2019s series showcasing innovative arts events across the UK is this short immersive dance performance from acclaimed choreographer Wayne McGregor.\u00a0 Titled Winged Bull in the Elephant Case, the work was inspired by the National Gallery\u2019s decision during the Second World War to hide some of Britain\u2019s art treasures in the Manod slate mine in Snowdonia. The resulting piece uses extraordinary dance forms, sound, animation, sculpture and even parkour to dramatise the story of one lost painting, which has taken human form, as it strives, with help from its friends, to return home to the National Gallery. Choreographed by McGregor and directed by Robin Friend, the performance was filmed both in the National Gallery and underground at the slate mine. The piece hopes to pose questions about how far we should go to preserve our cultural heritage in difficult times. A new exhibition of 24 archive photographs detailing how the paintings were removed and transported to the mine, along with pictures taken by Friend of how the mine looks today, is currently at\u00a0the National Gallery. Sarah Hughes The art of dance: Jacob O\u2019Connell and Fukiko Takase\u00a0 Winter Paralympics Live Channel 4, 6.00am\u00a0and 12.30am For the early birds, the action features the gold medal match in the wheelchair curling and the men\u2019s giant slalom. For the night owls, there is coverage of the women\u2019s giant slalom. As always, there is a round-up of events at 5.30pm. SH David Attenborough\u2019s Natural Curiosities BBC Two, 8.00pm;\u00a0not Scotland The fourth episode of the nature show considers whether plants have an awareness of maths. It may sounds crazy but it makes more sense once David Attenborough ponders why some bamboos flower at the same time, no matter where they are. The series continues on Friday.\u00a0SH The Voice UK ITV, 8.30pm The music contest moves into the knockout rounds with 12 acts singing for a place in the semi-finals under the competitive eyes of coaches Jennifer Hudson, will.i.am, Tom Jones and Olly Murs. With only one act from each group able to progress, who will be victorious?\u00a0SH Troy: Fall of a City BBC One, 9.00pm Things finally move up a gear in the historical epic with a dark, well-paced fifth episode. On the run from the Greeks, fugitive Paris (Louis Hunter) heads to the hills where he grew up. Meanwhile, the Trojans attempt to exploit divisions in the Greek camp. SH Below the Surface BBC Four,\u00a09.00pm and 9.45pm The Danish thriller continues to ratchet up the tension as the police find a wall covered with newspaper clips of task force leader Philip\u2019s (Johannes Lassen) time as a hostage. This leads them to suspect that there\u2019s a more personal element involved. Meanwhile, worried that no one is coming to help them, the hostages hatch their own plan\u2026\u00a0SH Mosaic Sky Atlantic, 10.00pm It\u2019s the penultimate episode of Steven Soderbergh\u2019s moody crime thriller and we\u2019re no nearer to knowing who killed author Olivia (Sharon Stone). This week, detective Nate (Devin Ratray) suspects that the wrong man was convicted of the crime, and tries to reopen the case. It\u2019s arguable that the plot is secondary to Soderbergh\u2019s desire to experiment with tone and form, while flooding us with information and tantalisingly withholding it too. Both fascinating and frustrating, this drama works best if you just sit back and enjoy the ride. SH Waterloo \u00a0(1970)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC Two, 1.20pm\u00a0 This lavish costume drama, which tells the story of the Battle of Waterloo, was estimated to have cost $100 m. It stars Rod Steiger as Napoleon, Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington and a cast of 15,000 Soviet soldiers as extras; director Sergei Bondarchuk was supposedly \u201cin command of the seventh largest army in the world\u201d during the film. Look out for a cameo by Orson Welles as Louis XVIII of France. Suite Francaise (2014)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC Two, 9.00pm;\u00a0NI\/Scotland, 10.00pm;\u00a0 Kristin Scott Thomas is more terrifying than the Nazis in this jarringly sweet Second World War romance adaptated from Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky\u2019s epic novel. Michelle Williams, as an unhappy housewife awaiting news from her prisoner-of-war husband and dealing with her haughty mother-in-law (Scott Thomas), does\u00a0her best to hold the story together with one of her tense performances. Defiance (2008)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC Two, 11.10pm; Scot, 12.10am; not NI Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell star as the Bielski brothers, Jews who escaped from Nazi-occupied Poland and formed a famous partisan army in the forest of Belarus. As well as fighting tooth and nail, their aim is to rescue who they can from the ghettos \u2013 not always compatible objectives. Edward Zwick\u2019s direction is too often crude and moralistic, but it\u2019s saved by the quality of the acting. SUNDAY The Durrells The Durrells ITV, 8.00pm \u201cWe are all happy,\u201d declares Louisa (Keeley Hawes) as the third run of ITV\u2019s smash-hit Sunday night series begins. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Genteel poverty may dog them, but the delightfully whimsical Durrell clan bask in permanent sunshine in Corfu with only cosy familial squabbling as a distraction. Still, there\u2019s a certain irony to Louisa\u2019s words as this enjoyable opener unravels. Her newly single daughter Margo (Daisy Waterstone) is plagued by boredom; peeved eldest son Larry (Josh O\u2019Connor) is smarting from the failure of his novel, and young son Gerry\u2019s (Milo Parker) growing animal collection meets his mother\u2019s disapproval. The main focus, however, is on gun-loving second son Leslie (Callum Woodhouse), who has a trio of girlfriends and is under pressure to choose between them.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Writer Simon Nye\u2019s carefully calibrated, nostalgia-tinged blend of comedy and drama, bolstered by the pitch-perfect performances (with Hawes and Waterstone particularly fine) are the programme\u2019s celebrated calling cards. And it\u2019s moving too. As the family gather around the table at the end of this episode, the scene warms the heart just as the best family-friendly shows should. Toby Dantzic Life and Death Row BBC iPlayer, from 10.00am The BBC has entered into the true-crime genre by focusing on death-row inmates in the US. This compelling series pulls off the difficult task of balancing the morality of the prisoners\u2019 fate against their often-horrendous offences, and its impact on the victim\u2019s families. This episode is no different, looking at the case of 32-year-old John Ramirez, who was convicted of murdering Mexican convenience-store worker Pablo Castro in a robbery that netted him just $1.25.\u00a0TD The Marriage of Figaro Sky Arts, 3.45pm This is a treat for opera lovers, as they have the chance to see a unique staging of Mozart\u2019s comic masterpiece performed in the composer\u2019s home town of Salzburg. Dan Ettinger conducts a young cast, which includes Adam Platcheka in the title role, Martina Jankov\u00e1 as his betrothed, the witty Susanna, and young German soprano Anett Fritsch as Countess Almaviva. TD Escape to the Chateau Channel 4, 8.00pm Dick and Angel Strawbridge return with a fourth series following their renovation of an idyllic Loire-set chateau. It\u2019s now summer, and the couple have their hands full preparing to host seven weddings.\u00a0TD Famously Unfit For Sport Relief BBC Two, 9.00pm Game celebrities \u2013 actress Tameka Empson, TV presenter Susannah Constantine and entertainer Les Dennis \u2013 hope to inspire the nation to become healthier by putting themselves through 10 weeks of gruelling fitness training. Their reward? Participating in one of the toughest and muddiest assault courses around.\u00a0TD The Good Karma Hospital ITV, 9.00pm A heatwave hits Kerala as this medical drama about a British doctor who transplants herself to southern India returns for a second run. In this episode, Dr Ruby (Amrita Acharia) is keen to manage her first solo night shift but the reality tests her confidence.\u00a0TD 13 Commandments Channel 4, 10.05pm It appears as if there is a never-ending supply of European crime dramas. This time we\u2019re in a provincial Belgian town which is shaken by the murder of a 16-year-old girl. Jaded detective Peter Devriendt (Dirk van Dijck) is put on the case, and it takes a shocking turn. TD Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ITV2, 5.05pm This sequel to the 2012 family hit blends entertaining slapstick with a surprisingly sophisticated message about tolerance. Dracula (Adam Sandler) is anxious to see whether his half-human, half-vampire grandson (Asher Blinkoff) will take after his side of the family, setting the stage for a clever allegory about acceptance. Selena Gomez and Steve Buscemi are among the voice cast. Catch Me If You Can (2002)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC Two, 5.45pm; not Scotland\/Wales Leonardo DiCaprio plays\u00a0the serial con artist Frank Abagnale Jnr in Steven Spielberg\u2019s charming fact-based drama. The film follows him as he finagles a small fortune by posing as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, all while remaining one step ahead of Tom Hanks\u2019 dogged FBI agent. Christopher Walken earned an Oscar nod for his turn as Abagnale Snr, while the real Frank Abagnale cameos. Brooklyn (2015)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC One, 8.30pm The star of Brooklyn is Fiona Weir \u2013 not a person who appears on screen, but the woman who cast it. In this pulse-quickening Irish immigrant song, adapted from Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s equally lovely novel, Weir and the film\u2019s director John Crowley achieve the kind of shivers-down-the-spine serendipity that can\u2019t\u00a0be taught with their young leads Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen. MONDAY Chequered history: the funeral of the Gibraltar Three in 1988 \u00a0 The Funeral Murders\u00a0 BBC Two, 9.00pm One of British television\u2019s most versatile and incisive documentary-makers, Vanessa Engle returns with this terrifying and wholly admirable survey of a particularly bleak fortnight in the chequered history of Northern Ireland pre-Good Friday Agreement. In March 1988, three IRA members were killed by the SAS in Gibraltar. Flown home via Dublin (Belfast airport staff refused to handle their bodies), they were driven to Belfast for a funeral that was left unpoliced by the RUC or the British Army, and then attacked by loyalist Michael Stone, leaving three dead and many injured. Days later, two British army soldiers were attacked by a mob and executed by the IRA after disrupting the funeral of one of Stone\u2019s victims.\u00a0 As a portrait of an apparently intractable mess, Engle\u2019s film could hardly be bettered. She talks to people on both sides of the conflict (some of them speaking for the first time), probing without provoking and extracting, if not the whole truth, then some startling revelations and bracing honesty. She is helped by astonishing footage of both funerals and the whole thing is a chilling reminder of a very dark time indeed in the history of these islands. Gabriel Tate MasterChef\u00a0 BBC One, 9.00pm The heats enter their final week and, picking from ingredients including cod, bone marrow and chorizo, the seven contestants must rustle up dishes to impress judges Torode and Wallace, two past winners and a losing finalist. GT Marcella\u00a0 ITV, 9.00pm This Anna Friel vehicle continues to career from shock tactic to unlikely plot twist as it reaches the halfway point. Tonight, Kevin Hoffs\u2019s blue lorry offers a vital clue and the full extent of the killer\u2019s depravity becomes apparent.\u00a0GT Electric Dreams:\u00a0Kill All Others\u00a0 Channel 4, 10.00pm The patchy sci-fi anthology series ends on a high with an electrifyingly powerful parable (directed by Mudbound\u2019s Dee Rees) of society\u2019s capacity to accept the unthinkable in exchange for a quiet life. Vera Farmiga stars as a fascist demagogue who rallies the populace to violence, one man (Mel Rodriguez) risks his life to stand up to her.\u00a0GT Imagine: Andrew Lloyd Webber: Memories\u00a0 BBC One, 10.45pm; NI, 11.10pm; not Wales Promoting his autobiography Unmasked, Andrew Lloyd Webber talks to Alan Yentob about his remarkable career and apparent capacity, at his Seventies and Eighties peak, to rustle up crowd-pleasing West End hits at will. GT This Country BBC Three, from 10.00am Gerran Howell proves an estimable addition to a pitch-perfect cast as Rev Seaton\u2019s son Jacob, returning from Bristol to resettle into village life \u2013 with, naturally, Kurtan (Charlie Cooper) stepping up to act as a mentor. Kerry\u2019s (Daisy May Cooper) efforts to give something back to the community continue when she visits her ailing neighbour, Florence, for a \u201ctea talk\u201d and the offer of a little company in the wake of the passing of the latter\u2019s cat. It is, of course, as sublimely funny as ever.\u00a0GT Hotspots: on the Frontline\u00a0 Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm Stuart Ramsay and Alex Crawford, much-garlanded veteran war reporters for Sky News, host this series aiming to show the realities of their work, from the raw fear of experiencing bombardment to the irrepressible emotions stoked during reports on particularly harrowing stories. This edition focuses on poaching in Namibia, journalism in Zimbabwe and continuing tensions in Jerusalem. GT The Train (1964, b\/w) \u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 1.15pm Director John Frankenheimer pitches French resistance member Paul Labiche (Burt Lancaster) against German Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Paul Scofield) in this Second World War art-theft adventure that knocks spots off George Clooney\u2019s misfiring The Monuments Men (2014). As the Germans retreat from Paris, Waldheim secures a train to bring back plundered masterpieces. Labyrinth (1986)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 5STAR, 7.55pm If you were born in the Eighties, then David Bowie wasn\u2019t just a musical genius \u2013 he was Jareth the Goblin King. Directed by Jim Henson, written by Terry Jones and with superb music from Bowie, this fantasy\u00a0film is a classic. When Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) accidentally wishes her baby brother away, she has just 13 hours to navigate her way through a world of weird creatures to find him before he\u2019s turned into a goblin.\u00a0 Signs (2002)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Sony Movie Channel, 9.00pm Director M Night Shyamalan has never had the tightest grip on reality but this alien invasion flick involving crop circles and green monsters has great difficulty in convincing us of anything other than that the director of The Sixth Sense is a bit of a one-hit wonder. Picking a clumsy Mel Gibson as his star doesn\u2019t help much. There is, though, great suspense, even if the film doesn\u2019t always make sense. TUESDAY \u00a0Great Indian Railway Journeys Great Indian Railway Journeys BBC Two, 8.00pm One thing you can say about Michael Portillo, he\u2019s not afraid of repeating a successful formula. In this new four-part excursion, he transplants every element of the previous train travel series he\u2019s made in Britain, America and Europe \u2013 from the Bradshaw\u2019s guide to his primary colour outfits and potted histories \u2013 to another of the world\u2019s most expansive rail networks, in India. Which guarantees that if you loved those series, you\u2019ll love this one just as much. So, with a trusty copy of Bradshaw\u2019s 1913 Handbook of Indian, Foreign and Colonial Travel in hand, he sets out to traverse the Punjab from Amritsar, the spiritual home of the Sikh religion, to the hyper-modern Le Corbusier-designed state capital of Chandigarh, before embarking on one of the most spectacular train rides of them all \u2013 the high-climbing narrow gauge line from Kolka to Shimla in the foothills of the Himalayas. Along the way he opens a window onto the extraordinary variety of life and landscape in India and also offers a tangible sense of the country\u2019s tangled history with Britain, and the tragedy that followed Partition in 1947. Armchair travel doesn\u2019t get much comfier than this. Gerard O\u2019Donovan \u00a0 All aboard: Michael Portillo in India \u00a0 The World\u2019s Ugliest Pets ITV, 8.00pm; not STV Caroline Quentin scours the country for the nation\u2019s most unsightly pets, from hairless guinea pigs to giant snails, and searches for the UK\u2019s ugliest dog to represent the country at The World\u2019s Ugliest Dog Contest in California.\u00a0GO The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up to Cancer Channel 4, 8.00pm Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, puts her meringue-balancing skills to the test in the third round of the celebrity Bake Off challenge. She\u2019s joined by comedian and composer Tim Minchin, Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing, and singer Ella Eyre.\u00a0GO Shetland BBC One, 9.00pm;\u00a0Wales, 10.40pm Another atmospheric series comes to a nail-biting close as DI Perez (Douglas Henshall) is forced to interview serial philanderer Duncan (Mark Bonnar) over the discrepancy in the DNA results. GO\u00a0 Mum BBC Two, 10.00pm; NI, 11.15pm Has there ever been a comedy so capable of moving us to tears? The penultimate episode sees Cathy (Lesley Manville) and Michael (Peter Mullan) plumb new depths of awkwardness in the wake of his confession following his mother\u2019s death. Surely something can bring these two together? GO Jasper Jones (2017)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Sky Cinema Premiere, 4.00pm Hugo Weaving and Toni Collette star in this adaptation of Craig Silvey\u2019s bestselling 2009 novel. Rachel Perkins directs this enchanting Sixties drama, a cross between To Kill a Mockingbird and Stand by Me, with care. Jasper Jones (Aaron McGrath), a teenage outcast of mixed white-Aboriginal heritage, asks for the help of shy bookworm Charlie Bucktin (Levi Miller) when a murder takes place. The Second\u00a0Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2015)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 9.00pm This sequel to the coming-of-old-age comedy, about a flock of English pensioners who migrate to India, is an improvement on its twee predecessor. Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, etc, all play to their strengths but the film finds something profound in their decision to see life out in\u00a0a place so teeming with it. Tamsin Greig and Richard Gere star as two new guests. The Tamarind Seed (1974)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 London Live, 10.00pm Director Blake Edwards and wife Julie Andrews abandoned Hollywood for exile in Europe where, in 1974, he released this Cold War spy story which he hoped would provide a more worthy showcase for Andrews\u2019s talents than the misbegotten Darling Lili. A romance develops in the Caribbean between Omar Sharif\u2019s KGB agent and Andrews\u2019s English widow when he tries to recruit her as one of his spies. WEDNESDAY\u00a0 Hit the road: Zoe Ball rides from Blackpool to Brighton \u00a0 Zoe Ball\u2019s Hardest Road Home BBC One, 9.00pm; Wales, 10.40pm As anyone who spends time listening to BBC radio will be aware, Zoe Ball spent five days this month cycling over 300 miles from her birthplace of Blackpool to her home back in Brighton to raise awareness for mental health as part of Sport Relief. This documentary covers that epic journey \u2013 and Ball, who does her absolute best to keep her spirits high even when the rolling Cotswolds hills threaten to be her undoing, comes across as an absolute trooper.\u00a0 There are the standard visits from celebrity pals along the way, including Fearne Cotton and McFly\u2019s\u00a0Harry Judd, but really this programme is about far more than Ball giving it her best shot.\u00a0 \u201cAs some of you might be aware, I lost my boyfriend Billy [Yates, who committed suicide last year during a period of depression] and after he died I really wanted to do something to try and help people who living with mental illness,\u201d Ball explains. And it\u2019s the moving conversations she has with others who have\u00a0lost loved ones to suicide that resonate. It all adds up to a surprisingly emotional journey and one that will hopefully do a great deal to challenge the stigmas around suicide and depression. Sarah Hughes The Secret Helpers BBC Two, 8.00pm\u00a0 This heart-warming series sees people given life advice from around the world. Tonight\u2019s subjects are Dan, who suffered two life-altering strokes, and Brett, who needs help caring for his twin babies. Stand-out helper is lovely Irish nun Sister Una \u2013 whom Brett clearly wishes could take over his life.\u00a0SH The Assassination\u00a0of Gianni Versarce: AMerican Crime Story BBC Two, 9.00pm The more time we spend with serial fantasist and murderer Andrew Cunanan, the more Darren Criss, who plays him, walks off with the series. Tonight sees Cunanan very much to the fore as we head back to April 1997 to examine how his murderous\u00a0spree began. SH Benidorm ITV, 9.00pm More chaos in Spain as a furious Joyce (Sherrie Hewson) sacks Monty (John Challis) \u2013 will a chance meeting help him win back his job?\u00a0SH Damned Channel 4, 10.00pm An outstanding second series of Jo Brand\u2019s gentle social worker comedy comes to a suitably bittersweet end as Rose (Brand) finds her new relationship under threat, while Al (Alan Davies) considers moving on.\u00a0The episode\u2019s star, however, is Himesh Patel\u2019s Nitin, who takes\u00a0it upon himself to guide Nat (Isy Suttie) through her pregnancy, with predictable results. SH Make! Craft Britain BBC Four, 9.00pm The most relaxing new show of the week is this three-part celebration of crafting presented by Martha Kearney. Today\u2019s episode focuses on hooky rugmaking, as six amateurs are taught how to make chair cushions and letterpress printmaking by rugmaker Heather Ritchie, while five people attend typographer Kelvyn Smith\u2019s south London workshop. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got the patience,\u201d notes the chatty Lorna \u2013but it all turns out OK\u00a0in the end.\u00a0SH Save Me Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm No one does distressed motherhood more gut-wrenchingly than Suranne Jones, who is on terrific if devastating form tonight as Lennie James\u2019s outstanding drama reaches its half way point. Convinced that the police aren\u2019t doing enough and certain that her daughter Jody is in increasing danger, Jones\u2019s Claire reaches out to Nelly (James). But in a dark world where no one is quite as they claim, can she truly trust him? SH Surrogates (2009)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Sony Movie Channel, 9.00pm Bruce Willis does double duty in this sci-fi thriller, about a future society in which cybernetic avatars do all our dirty work, as both Robo-Bruce and the ageing human cop who controls it. A new weapon has been devised, by unknown enemies of the state, which can frazzle these androids and simultaneously melt\u00a0the brains of their human puppeteers. It\u2019s Philip K Dick-lite but good fun. The Equalizer (2014)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 Channel 5, 11.20pm Film plots don\u2019t come much more simple, or dumber, than this blazingly violent Denzel Washington movie that makes Liam Neeson\u2019s Taken franchise look like Taxi Driver. After helping\u00a0a teenage prostitute (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) free herself from a den of snarling pimps, a mild-mannered hardware store employee (Washington) turns avenging angel. If you like\u00a0it loud, and unsubtle,\u00a0this might be for you. Short Term 12 (2013)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC One, 11.45pm;\u00a0NI, 12.40am; Scotland\/Wales, 12.45am Set in a foster-care home, Destin Cretton\u2019s sharply and sensitively told film follows a pregnant staff member (Brie Larson, in a powerful performance) who is groping nervously towards a family life with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jnr), who also works at the facility. But when a surly young girl (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives, her particular case stirs up painful ghosts. \u00a0 THURSDAY\u00a0 Portrait of a King: Trevor McDonald in Atlanta, Georgia Martin Luther King by Trevor McDonald ITV, 9.00pm Martin Luther King changed American politics for good and his non-violent brand of civil-rights protest continues to influence today\u2019s campaigners. Trevor McDonald presents this worthwhile profile, which, if a tad by the book, is bolstered by its host\u2019s demonstrable commitment and a stellar list of contributors including Colin Powell, Harry Belafonte and civil-rights leaders Al Sharpton and Andrew Young. While the material regarding the\u00a0 \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech and the Montgomery bus boycott may be familiar to most, and the interview with a former KKK member resolutely unsurprising, the story of King\u2019s early life and almost accidental involvement with the civil rights movement is fascinating.\u00a0 Towards the end of his life, King jockeyed with the growing Black Power movement and fell out with US president Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Democrats over his public and, for the time, extraordinarily bold conflation of the Vietnam War with endemic racism and poverty. These issues don\u2019t perhaps receive the attention they deserve in the UK. At its heart, this is a solid, straightforward look at one of the most significant figures of the previous century. GT EastEnders BBC One, 7.30pm & 9.00pm After her brief sojourn in Redwater, Ireland, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) returns to Albert Square, gatecrashing a celebration of her life which is being held by those believing her dead. Will this splashy coup be enough to wrest the initiative back from Coronation Street after a difficult run for EastEnders?\u00a0GT Big Cats About the House BBC Two, 8.00pm Giles Clark, of Tigers About the House fame, takes over Kent\u2019s Big Cat Sanctuary, with the aim of turning it into a global pioneer for conservation. Yet, in this opener of the three-part observational documentary, he meets obstacles early in the shape of a neglected jaguar cub. Not Going Out BBC One, 8.30pm Lee (Lee Mack) and Lucy (Sally Bretton) fall out with their best friends Toby (Hugh Dennis)\u00a0and Anna (Abigail Cruttenden) over, of all things, a toy keyring that goes missing, as this engagingly old-school sitcom continues.\u00a0GT Civilisations BBC Two, 9.00pm Mary Beard helms her second and final episode of this lavish but worthwhile enterprise, this time devoted to how invisible deities are transformed into visual art \u2013 and the price sometimes paid by those who would do so. It is nourishing for both the brain and the eyes. GT The Glyndebourne Opera Cup Sky Arts, 8.00pm The Glyndebourne Opera Cup brings to prominence some of the world\u2019s most promising young opera singers. This is a behind-the-scenes peek at the competition.\u00a0GT Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic BBC Four, 9.00pm Here\u2019s a fun premise: using a mobile phone app to track the nationwide spread of a flu pandemic over the course of a single day from a single carrier in a Surrey town. Hannah Fry is \u201cpatient zero\u201d, while Javid Abdelmoneim investigates why\u00a0flu presents such a serious threat to the nation\u2019s health.\u00a0GT SEAL Team Sky One, 9.00pm The title alone will\u00a0tell you whether this muscular new thriller series is for you. David Boreanaz (Bones) and Mad Men\u2019s Jessica Par\u00e9 are paired as troubled special ops man Jason Hayes and his hard-nosed CIA liaison. Their first mission is snatch-and-grab in Liberia. GT Under Siege (1992)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Channel 5, 10.00pm A gang of terrorists led by a disaffected CIA man (Tommy Lee Jones) hijacks a US battleship, planning to steal its nuclear missiles and hand them over to North Korea. Everything goes to plan until they are thwarted by Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal), who displays a frankly alarming level of martial-arts prowess for a ship\u2019s cook. An enjoyable, if ridiculous, thriller directed by Andrew Davis (The Fugitive). Dancer in the Dark (2000)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 London Live, 10.15pm Provocative auteur Lars Von Trier serves up a Hollywood-style musical with a difference: shot in Europe on choppy hand-held camera. Pixie-popster Bj\u00f6rk plays a factory worker who\u2019s going blind; her attempts to save her child from the same fate end in heartbreak, with slapdash musical numbers. But surrender yourself to the experience, and you\u2019ll end up snivelling into a hankie. The Dictator (2012)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ITV4, 11.00pm Sacha Baron Cohen plays Aladeen, a North African dictator and a cross between Saddam Hussein and Colonel Gaddafi (whose death must have occurred during production). Ben Kingsley has him kidnapped and replaced by a lookalike, leading to Aladeen being adrift in Brooklyn, and taken under the wing of feminist Anna Faris. The jokes are designed to offend, though it\u2019s notable that they steer clear of religion. FRIDAY\u00a0 Sticking an oar in:\u00a0Ellie Harrison, Dev Griffin, Sara Cox, Sophie Raworth, Rory Reid Sport Relief 2018 BBC One and BBC Two, from 7.00pm Having raised a record-breaking \u00a355,444,906 in 2016, Sport Relief returns with another night of laughs, challenges, music and assorted silly sports-related japes to coax more generous donations from the viewing public.\u00a0 Among the highlights this year, Celebrity Boxing makes a comeback with six well-padded famous faces (among them Helen Skelton and Spencer Matthews) taking to the ring for a knockout series of bouts. Also on the cards, comedian John Bishop is on a mission to help England win the World Cup (if they\u2019re\u00a0 not boycotting it); there\u2019s a clash-of-the-channels BBC vs ITV boat race; and a Strictly Come Dancing special session in which football stars Alex Scott, Chris Kamara and David Ginola transfer their fancy footwork to the dance floor. Gary Lineker, Davina McCall and Ore Oduba are\u00a0among those hosting on BBC One, and Sue Barker keeps things ticking over on BBC Two while the News at Ten is on with a special edition of A Question of Sport on BBC Two (with guests Denise Lewis, Frank Skinner, Paddy McGuinness and Ed Balls). The fun, frolics and fundraising then continues into the wee hours on BBC One.

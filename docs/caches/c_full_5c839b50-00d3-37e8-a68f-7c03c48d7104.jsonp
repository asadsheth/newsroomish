Wenger signs off saying he 'had disagreements' with the fans: 'But we had one thing in common: we loved Arsenal FC'","summary":"To the end, there was dignity and, to use one of his favourite words, , humanity to Arsene Wenger as he bowed out,quite literally, as Arsenal manager after 22 years, 1,235 games and this, his 707th victory. One-nil to the Arsenal, in fact, although that was never a scoreline he cherished or that was associated with him. There was sentimentality, too \u2013 and why not as Wenger spoke of the appropriateness of Huddersfield Town being his final opponent in what otherwise was an inconsequential fixture? \u201cHerbert Chapman, maybe our greatest manager, came from here,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cFor me to come here on the last day had a special meaning when you know the history of our club. In fact, there was a photo just in front of the dressing room where Chapman smiled at me because he was on the photo.\u201d Chapman smiling down on Wenger is certainly some romantic image, one that resonates powerfully for all Arsenal fans. Chapman was Huddersfield\u2019s greatest manager, in their golden period in the 1920s when they won league titles, with three stars adorning their shirts, and were such a force in English football that he was poached by Arsenal and transformed them too. For 22 years, for 1,235 games, for 49, 49 undefeated, for 7 FA Cups, for 3 @PremierLeague titles, for two Doubles, for winning the league at Old Trafford and White Hart Lane, for Wengerball, for the Invincibles, for your total love and devotion, we want to say... #MerciArs\u00e8ne\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com\/xkRXjLAid2\u2014 Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) May 13, 2018 Chapman revolutionised the role of the manager, making him more powerful in an era when decisions were made by committee. Privately, Wenger might ruefully consider the wheel is turning full circle away from his profession, given the nature of his departure, as he first walked past the bust of Chapman at the entrance to the John Smith Stadium, then the photograph before he took to the pitch to be met by a guard of honour. Before kick-off, Wenger strode towards the travelling Arsenal supporters and bowed to them, later saying it was a spontaneous act of appreciation. \u201cWe had disagreements, which I accept, but we had one thing in common: we loved Arsenal Football Club, and I wanted to share that with them,\u201d he said. Thanks for the 22 years Credit: PA Wenger went to the away dug-out an hour before the game to get some \u201coxygen\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand when you don\u2019t know how deep the love is for the game [in England],\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIt was a fantastic experience for me. Where do I go from there? That\u2019s the difficulty. When you\u2019ve experienced this intensity for such a long time, I don\u2019t know where I go. I\u2019ll remain a fan wherever I go.\u201d Wenger will now look forward to the next phase of his career and his life. The 68-year-old has already divulged he has had many offers and confirmed that they included Premier League clubs. \u201cYes, I had offers, yes, of course,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at the moment, I have not said anything to anybody. I came out of a long process and you cannot just the next morning go somewhere else. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d But could he manage against Arsenal? \u201cI\u2019m not ready for that at the moment,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThat would be very difficult, I\u2019d stay at home that day. Maybe, I don\u2019t envisage that at the moment. Maybe it\u2019s better I go somewhere else.\u201d He suggested that Arsenal are only \u201csome additions\u201d away from competing for the Premier League title. Although that may not only depend on how many is \u201csome\u201d but who manages them, one player who will be crucial to the future is surely Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Arsene Wenger waves to the fans before the match Credit: Reuters Wenger\u2019s final signing, if it was his decision, and most expensive ever signing scored the only goal, and it means he has struck 10 times in just 13 league games since he arrived in January for \u00a356 million. \u00a0The goal was also one that will have delighted Wenger as it was constructed through a slick passing move involving Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alexandre Lacazette, with the latter sliding the ball through to Aaron Ramsey who prodded it across goal for Aubameyang to force home. Arsene Wenger's replacement at Arsenal That was tough on Huddersfield who should have scored through Steve Mounie, with a header, and Tom Ince, who ballooned over, but it did not detract from the celebratory atmosphere. However, there may be a pang of alarm from their supporters in the non-committal way manager David Wagner later spoke about his own future, having kept the club up against the odds. Fans hold up a Arsene Wenger banner Credit: Getty Club owner Dean Hoyle had taken to the pitch at half-time to suggest Wagner would stay, but the German later said simply that the chairman was putting \u201cpressure\u201d on himself with that declaration.

A Huddersfield player gets a head on it, Ospina bravely gathers and gets a whack in the process. He's stopped it on the line. For a second there is a suggestion that it was over the line, but no. Bit of bad feeling from the players about the challenge on the keeper, and there's a booking. But it is no goal. 4:49PM 90+ mins We are going to have three minutes added.

Perfect ball from Mkhi, ut Lacazette tries to chip the keeper, and Lossl has read him like a comic. Easy grab in the end. 4:36PM 77 mins A corner into the box and that man Mounie has yet again got above his opponents. Cannot get the header on target. He goes down with cramp and, in fact, Wagner is now taking him off. Arsenal's defenders will be glad to see the back of him! 4:33PM 75 mins Ramsey and now Welbeck get chances to deliver balls in, but not able to find the pass. 4:30PM 72 mins Mounie now gets to work on Monreal.

There is some blood. 4:14PM 55 mins Huddersfield are clearly from the \"if you don't buy a ticket...\" school of thought. But they keep failing to hit the target. Alex Pritchard drills one over. 4:12PM 54 mins Ospina has hurt his foot\/leg and is limping around gingerly. Ooh, fun! Will we see a lesser-spotted keeper?\u00a0Matt Macey is the goalie on the bench. 4:10PM 52 mins\u00a0 Mounie attempts a bicycle kick. It is not a success.

Fans asked him for a wave and he delivered. Arsene Wenger waves to the fans before the match Credit: Reuters 3:48PM Half time: Huddersfield 0 Arsenal 1 Arsene strides off to give his last half-time talk. A low-impact fixture, his side were a bit sloppy in the first 20, and Huddersfield had the better of it. The one moment of real forward quality came from Aubameyang, whose excellent movement took him into the six-yard box for a tap-in. 3:46PM Lingo bingo This \"au revoir\" and \"merci\" Arsene thing: he's been here 22 years.

A bit like a game in the park after two cans. 3:31PM 28 mins Read an article by Sam Wallace earlier about players' wages. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u00a0featured. Becoz eeez worf eeet.

A pathetic dead ball attempt. He wins an ill-deserved corner. That comes to little. 3:20PM 18 mins Arsenal break, but give it away. Now another break from the visitors.\u00a0Sead Kolasinac , for some reason, decides he's going to try and beat the whole team. Chopped down on the edge of the area by\u00a0Mathias Jorgensen.\u00a0 3:18PM 14 mins Ince again! Another shot, this one wide. Arsenal haven't turned up at all and a team with better strikers than Huddersfield would be up by now. 3:15PM Plane speaking An airplane flies over the stadium with a message to Arsene Wenger Credit: Getty 3:14PM 10 mins Unless his spineless team wake up, old Mr W is going to be signing off with a defeat. They're getting opened up with ease here.\u00a0Alex Pritchard gallopes onto a long ball. He clips it back for Ince, who should have done a lot better from 10 or so yards out.

Christopher Schindler's struck that well, but Arsenal scramble clear. 3:04PM 3 mins But we have our first chance now, as Huddersfield get down the right. Cross in, Moune gets up, and he works the keeper with a header. 3:04PM 2 mins It's a happy occasion for the Huddersfield fans, able to go into the last day knowing that they will definitely be staying up.

It's the final game of the season for Huddersfield and Arsenal and, more significantly, the last in Arsene Wenger's 22-reign as Arsenal manager. When is it? It's on Sunday May 13 - ie today. What time is kick-off? It's a 3pm BST start. What TV channel is it on? It's not, unfortunately. Despite being Wenger's final game in charge of Arsenal, Sky Sports have opted to show the games at Liverpool and Newcastle instead. Arsenal fans wave farewell to Arsene Wenger at the Emirates - in pictures What is the team news? Huddersfield Town Huddersfield boss David Wagner will select from an unchanged squad for his side's last Premier League game of the season at home against Arsenal. Wagner has no new injuries following Wednesday night's draw at Chelsea, which secured them another season in the top flight. Tom Ince is hoping to feature after recovering from a hamstring injury, while Michael Hefele (knee), Elias Kachunga and Danny Williams (both ankle) remain sidelined. Provisional squad: Lossl, Kongolo, Schindler, Jorgensen, Hadergjonaj, Hogg, Mooy, Van La Parra, Pritchard, Ince, Quaner, Mounie, Malone, Depoitre, Billing, Coleman, Lowe, Smith. Arsenal Arsenal will be without the suspended Konstantinos Mavropanos for Arsene Wenger's final game as manager when the Gunners travel to Huddersfield on the last day of the Premier League season. The young defender was shown a straight red card in Wednesday's 3-1 loss at Leicester and will be forced to sit out the game in West Yorkshire having started the Gunners' last three league matches. Mesut Ozil (back), Mohamed Elneny (ankle), Laurent Koscielny and Santi Cazorla (both Achilles) are also missing but the likes of Alexandre Lacazette and Jack Wilshere could return after sitting out in midweek. Provisional squad: Cech, Ospina, Bellerin, Holding, Mustafi, Chambers, Mertesacker, Monreal, Nelson, Kolasinac, Maitland-Niles, Xhaka, Willock, Wilshere, Ramsey, Iwobi, Mkhitaryan, Welbeck, Lacazette, Nketiah, Aubameyang. What are they saying? David Wagner on Arsene Wenger \"I can't imagine that this can happen again, so this only shows he has done something extraordinary,\" Wagner said. \"Words don't describe enough how big this achievement is which he has done for his football club and football in this country. \"I'm so happy that we are able to host him in his last Premier League game after 22 years, that we are able to host him in these circumstances, we really can give him all the honour and all the attention he deserves. \"This is possible after our last result on Wednesday and we as a football club will do it. We have the biggest respect for what he has done and we're happy we play our last game against him.\" Best-priced accumulators | New customer offers Wenger on the Emirates \"We had to do it,\" he said, when asked if he would take back the stadium move in exchange for trophies. \"There is no club that can turn people who wanted to attend the game down. At the time I thought we were a bit too ambitious with 60,000 (capacity) but at the end of the day it worked,\" he said. \"It's not really happened because other clubs have used outside resources. We had a double handicap. We had to pay back the debt and had to face the competition where clubs have even more resources than they usually have. \"I believe Highbury had a special spirit. It's a cathedral, a church. You could smell the soul of every guy that played there. So it was special. It will always be special for me. \"The Emirates for me was like buying a new house. It took us a while to feel at home there. It's a fantastic stadium - but there was something special at Highbury that you could never recreate when you build something new. What are the odds? Huddersfield 19\/4 Arsenal - 4\/7 Draw - 18\/5 What's our prediction? Jason Burt:\u00a0There is nothing riding on Arsene Wenger\u2019s last match in charge of Arsenal except for one thing \u2013 can he really end the season as the only manager in English football not to gain any points away from home in 2018? Surely the Arsenal players will not let that happen while Huddersfield, safe from relegation, may still be on that party bus.

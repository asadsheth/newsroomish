Trump announced his decision to pardon pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to U.S. campaign finance law violations and was an outspoken critic of Democratic former President Barack Obama, on Twitter, saying he had been \"treated very unfairly by our government!\" The Republican president then told reporters on a flight to Houston he was also considering a pardon for Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements in an insider-trading probe.","published_at":1527769996,"content_id":"0630901e-6467-3a6c-82dc-d1e5564ce79d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-says-pardon-conservative-commentator-dinesh-dsouza-133449649.html","content_published_at":1527793707,"content_time":1527793707,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"President

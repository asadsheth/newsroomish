After a decade of steep cost declines, wind and solar installations, often paired with battery storage, are increasingly displacing older coal and gas-fired power plants, benefiting battery makers and some utilities, the Barron's cover story said.

The engineers behind the Caledonia Clean Energy Project (CCEP) claim a scheme to strip the carbon emissions from the flue of a gas-fired power plant could be developed through a Government contract worth between \u00a380 and \u00a390 a megawatt hour. The project would be a lower cost to the consumer than high-profile new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, and produce just a tenth of the carbon emissions of a traditional gas-fired power plant. A full-scale CCS value-chain - C02 storage By using carbon capture technology, and existing pipeline infrastructure to transport and permanently store the gas underground, the developers \u00adbelieve they may have found an answer to Britain\u2019s need for flexible and predictable low-carbon power. \u201cUntil now, it has not been possible to take advantage of the desirable flexibility of natural gas-fired power plants to support renewables without having to accept significant amounts of undesirable CO2 emissions,\u201d said the project\u2019s feasibility study. \u201cAs this report shows, CCEP can help resolve this long-standing technical, global \u00adclimate, and grid conundrum.\u201d Gas-fired power plants are an ideal partner to renewable energy projects because their output can be easily ramped up and wound down, in line with changes to wind and solar output. However, the UK\u2019s reliance on gas is \u00adunder pressure due to legally binding climate targets to reduce the amount of carbon from the energy sector. Stephen Kerr, from CCEP, said the project could also serve as the \u201canchor tenant\u201d for infrastructure that makes carbon capture and storage possible for some of Scotland\u2019s largest chemical plants and refineries.","published_at":1528664708,"content_id":"de9ae451-e8e0-3c4a-9a00-60c6310380b2","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/scottish-breakthrough-carbon-capture-technology-205656761.html","content_published_at":1528664216,"content_time":1528664216,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":20,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

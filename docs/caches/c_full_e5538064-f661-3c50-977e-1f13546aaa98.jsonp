One of the greatest technological advances known to man was the invention of electricity.","published_at":1527513916,"content_id":"32d9f097-5372-3aee-abf2-f162f83e7c26","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/andrewrossow\/2018\/05\/28\/when-cryptocurrency-goes-green-blockchain-can-save-the-environment\/","content_published_at":1527513540,"content_time":1527513540,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"407d308e-2cea-3e17-b952-02a5cb16f1b8","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-d24558a1-fe0c-38f9-959f-8b5a8b46c182_a-407d308e-2cea-3e17-b952-02a5cb16f1b8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-d24558a1-fe0c-38f9-959f-8b5a8b46c182_a-407d308e-2cea-3e17-b952-02a5cb16f1b8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-d24558a1-fe0c-38f9-959f-8b5a8b46c182_a-407d308e-2cea-3e17-b952-02a5cb16f1b8","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Reuters","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-02-01\/973af590-e89a-11e6-b294-9bc8096ac008_reuters.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/eu-moves-ban-single-plastics-123850848.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/88wPYUobf4Zd1.QNCzV03A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-28T123850Z_1_LYNXNPEE4R0NH_RTROPTP_2_EUROPE-ENVIRONMENT-PLASTICS.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0SqRheyMvmZ6VDklW7081Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDI7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-28T123850Z_1_LYNXNPEE4R0NH_RTROPTP_2_EUROPE-ENVIRONMENT-PLASTICS.JPG","height":302,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-28T123850Z_1_LYNXNPEE4R0NH_RTROPTP_2_EUROPE-ENVIRONMENT-PLASTICS.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":302,"title":"EU moves to ban single-use plastics","summary":"The European Commission on Monday proposed banning single-use plastic products such as cotton buds and plastic straws and putting the burden of cleaning up waste on manufacturers in an effort to reduce marine litter.

You definitely can't plug up the summit crater nor those two dozen fissures \u2013 unless, of course, you want to create a more explosive series of events further down the line \u2013 and you certainly can't block a lava flow of this magnitude by building barriers or using water; with few exceptions, this course of action simply isn't practical. Sure, a 1983 lava flow on Mount Etna was successfully redirected using new trenches dug out using dynamite, but how would you apply this to Kilauea?","published_at":1527485059,"content_id":"6fd897c7-2713-3fc2-a1f4-e1c00ab2059c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robinandrews\/2018\/05\/28\/why-cant-we-artificially-drain-magma-chambers-to-stop-volcanic-eruptions\/","content_published_at":1527513300,"content_time":1527513300,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"37d2d36c-aad1-33b0-9992-f340d61e91a8","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-4e2963eb-79a6-3dc9-92ca-c1455815536d_a-37d2d36c-aad1-33b0-9992-f340d61e91a8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-4e2963eb-79a6-3dc9-92ca-c1455815536d_a-37d2d36c-aad1-33b0-9992-f340d61e91a8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/sweeping-gene-survey-reveals-facets-evolution-2wgdtip","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sweeping-gene-survey-reveals-facets-evolution-032739086.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nyZ9.UEPmrgTuPKY2SAZ9A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/bff9766016d3c4de3ddf48d3ec55002fefb1b69d.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FBhAhdgH4OyqFbpQbmwXJg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02OTg7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/bff9766016d3c4de3ddf48d3ec55002fefb1b69d.jpg","height":698,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/bff9766016d3c4de3ddf48d3ec55002fefb1b69d.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":698,"title":"Sweeping gene survey reveals new facets of evolution","summary":"It is textbook biology, for example, that species with large, far-flung populations -- think ants, rats, humans -- will become more genetically diverse over time. \"The answer is no,\" said Stoeckle, lead author of the study, published in the journal Human Evolution.

But in South Africa's parks and game reserves, rhino are being slaughtered at the rate of three a day, targeted by poachers who want their horns. Tonight we'll show you an unusual and controversial plan to save the rhino by removing them from the wild and, instead, farming them like cattle. It's quite a departure from another solution to the rhino crisis we showed you last December \u2013 which was aimed at keeping them in their natural habitat. Doing that required something unusual and unforgettable \u2013 an airlift. Which is how we started our earlier report.

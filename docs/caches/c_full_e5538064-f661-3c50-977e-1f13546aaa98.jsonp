The mile-long underwater walls of nylon mesh that catch swordfish are under growing scrutiny, because they sometimes entangle\u00a0sea lions, dolphins, whales and other species of marine life. The undercover footage was shot on two drift net boats in Southern California between December 2016 and December 2017 by an animal welfare activist posing as a freelance filmmaker.

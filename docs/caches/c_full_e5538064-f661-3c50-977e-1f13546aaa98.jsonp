The National Audit Office said the rule changes made to last year\u2019s auction for contracts to support new, low-carbon power projects mean that energy users will be on the hook for an extra \u00a3100m a year. Over the fifteen year life-span of the contracts, which guarantee the project\u2019s earnings through top-up payments, costs will spiral \u00a31.5bn higher than might otherwise have been the case without the Government\u2019s tinkering. The reverse auction was initially lauded as a major success for Government after prices steadily fell to new lows, and eventually awarded 11 contracts to projects capable of powering 3.6 million homes. The falling costs were largely driven by offshore wind developers which have dramatically cut the cost of their mega-turbines in recent years. Prices could have fallen lower if not for a cap on the capacity available to small-scale projects which burn biomass or waste to generate power. The NAO said this might have squeezed out cheaper projects which were too large to fit within the cap. The UK's new investment in clean energy ($) Credit: Bloomberg New Energy Finance The Government\u2019s spending watchdog scolded the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for changing the limits on which technologies could take part in the auction without thoroughly testing the impact. \u201cThe Department did not highlight the change to its programme management board or test whether it was likely to lead to unintended consequences,\u201d the NAO report said. \u201cIn some situations, the design change could have produced better value for money for consumers, but the Department did not assess how likely these were to occur in practice\u201d. The unnecessary cost hike has emerged alongside a fresh report from MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee which warned that the UK\u2019s green investment has plummeted to its lowest level in ten years, in a \u201cdramatic and worrying collapse\u201d for the energy industry. The report revealed that investment in clean energy fell by 10pc in 2016 and 56pc in 2017, to its lowest level since 2008. \u201cBillions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets,\u201d said Mary Creagh, the committee\u2019s chair. \u201cThe Government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the investment required to meet the UK\u2019s climate change targets.\u201d Specifically the committee has called on Government to provide greater clarity on how it intends to deliver the Clean Growth Strategy by the 2018 Budget, and explore the potential of Sovereign Green Bonds.","published_at":1526425520,"content_id":"86cbcdd7-aa7f-34ca-ba77-4c5918911e7e","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/government-green-subsidy-tinkering-cost-230100226.html","content_published_at":1526425260,"content_time":1526425260,"content_relative_time":7,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":7,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"86ae22fd-ce2b-3784-a3a3-4a428688173c","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-cefa6f43-253b-3b0e-b54f-fa0f13404f88_a-86ae22fd-ce2b-3784-a3a3-4a428688173c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-cefa6f43-253b-3b0e-b54f-fa0f13404f88_a-86ae22fd-ce2b-3784-a3a3-4a428688173c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/latest-court-vacates-key-atlantic-4jdun33","author":"nanook","provider":"Associated Press","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.ap.org\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/04\/21\/image001-png_162613.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/latest-court-vacates-key-atlantic-003218551.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Latest: Pipeline spokeswoman: Work can go on despite ruling","summary":"RICHMOND, Va.

The Caltrans solution, estimated to cost $12 million, has morphed in five years from a tunnel to \u201cthe most optimal design,\u201d a 60-foot roadway bridge with an undercrossing to give large animals safe passage, according to Nancy Siepel, a Caltrans biologist. A major commuter route, Highway 17 sees about 61,500 vehicles a day locally, according to Caltrans, and there are no culverts where animals might cross. Laurel Curve was selected because this is where a majority of mountain lions roaming to the Diablo Range and the Gabilan Mountains cross Highway 17, according to data from the Santa Cruz Puma Project, a UC Santa Cruz study that began in 2008.","published_at":1526305546,"content_id":"a86ba84a-3230-3f09-8952-e52c1b0dd646","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/05\/14\/highway-17-roadkill-solution-coming-in-2021\/","content_published_at":1526305434,"content_time":1526305434,"content_relative_time":40,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":40,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"4c3f2a02-6d90-3b49-b7f0-8c358c63f37a","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-41574f23-4328-3bf2-bda8-cec1878422b7_a-4c3f2a02-6d90-3b49-b7f0-8c358c63f37a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-41574f23-4328-3bf2-bda8-cec1878422b7_a-4c3f2a02-6d90-3b49-b7f0-8c358c63f37a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/exposing-indoor-air-quality-monitoring-civzom2","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/02\/07\/new-forbes-logo-jpg_213156.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kensilverstein\/2018\/05\/14\/exposing-indoor-air-quality-monitoring-and-energy-efficiency-are-helping\/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Exposing Indoor Air Quality: Monitoring And Energy Efficiency Are Helping","summary":"US Environmental Protection Agency workers don protective gear at 110 Liberty St to test cleaning methods as part of the EPA's indoor clean air initiative for Lower Manhattan, New York, New York, June 27, 2002.

The quakes had magnitudes ranging from 2.5 to 4.1. There are no reports of injuries or damage. Many of the thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years have been linked to the underground injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas production. State regulators have directed several producers to close or reduce volumes in some wells. Scientists say the threshold for damage usually starts at 4.0.

The Seahawks contacted Kaepernick approximately two weeks ago to arrange a visit before the plans were altered unexpectedly due to his anthem stance, Schefter reported, citing a source. Per Schefter, Kaepernick was unwilling to say that he would alter his anthem stance that began in 2016 as a means to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The workout had been scheduled for Monday, according to Pro Football Talk, which added that it was only when the workout date approached that the Seahawks contacted Kaepernick to request that he commit to standing for the anthem.","published_at":1523564279,"content_id":"34486024-381b-3ffd-a1fb-8d5610704786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Sports_News\/NFL\/2018\/04\/12\/Report-Kaepernicks-visit-with-Seahawks-postponed\/9201523560112\/","content_published_at":1523560283,"content_time":1523560283,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/nfl\/2018\/04\/12\/nfl-rejects-burficts-appeal-upholds-4-game-suspension\/33779589\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wQL4qwuR4c9Z.T75GmYXAA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NvNLBQ0ujLv8d2HaTvj9_g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"NFL rejects Burfict's appeal, upholds 4-game suspension","summary":"CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict will be sidelined to start a season for the fourth year in a row, this time serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancers.

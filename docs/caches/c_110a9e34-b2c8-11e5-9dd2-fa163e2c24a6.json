How about Arden Key from LSU","summary":"When pick 18 of the first round arrives around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 26, at the 2018 NFL Draft, and the Seattle Seahawks are finally on the clock, and Washington defensive tackle Vita Vea is still on the board, one impulse will course through thousands of fans' nervous systems.

Because they'll take someone like... Arden Key. The LSU Tiger does not carry the ball, throw it, or kick it, unless it bounces into his hand or off his foot following a forced fumble.","published_at":1523225754,"content_id":"c588412c-88f8-3c2e-9eb4-f63c10218324","content_url":"https:\/\/www.fieldgulls.com\/2018\/4\/8\/17210864\/nfl-draft-seahawks-first-round-arden-key-vita-vea?src=rss","content_published_at":1523163600,"content_time":1523163600,"content_relative_time":37,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":37,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

But the scientists aboard never made it to their destination: The Amundsen was diverted to rescue unsuspecting ships that had become entrapped by Arctic ice floes that moved into North Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. In past years, these masses of Arctic ice had mostly stayed put in their proper ocean \u2014 the Arctic \u2014 but increasing temperatures caused ice to melt, unclogging the channels connecting the Arctic to the north Atlantic, thus allowing massive surges of ice to flow freely south. \u00a0 SEE ALSO: Gas-filled vessel barrels solo through pathetic Arctic sea ice during dead of winter Scientists aboard the vessel documented the event and published their research in the journal Geophysical Research Letters on March 15, warning that the threat of ice-trapping events could become more commonplace.\u00a0 Icebergs from Greenland's glaciers have long been a hazard for ships in the North Atlantic, particularly during the months of April and May. An iceberg from Greenland's Jakobshavn Glacier is thought to have been responsible for sinking the Titanic in 1912, for example.\u00a0 But now boats are running into trouble because of sea ice getting flushed out of the Arctic.\u00a0 \"The warming in the Arctic and decline in ice cover is increasing the ability of this ice to be transported out of the Arctic, to areas that typically don\u2019t have these large pieces of ice,\" said David Babb, a research scientist at the University of Manitoba's Center for Earth Observation Science, in an interview. Babb is a scientist who was aboard the icebreaker, and is a coauthor of the study. The rescue events for trapped, punctured, and sinking ships specifically occurred in an expanse of ocean north of the large Canadian Island of Newfoundland. Two fishing ships were sunk by the ice, and other ships \u2014 including ferries and an oil tanker \u2014 had to be escorted to ice-free waters by the formidable Amundsen. One fishing vessel could only travel a few hundred meters before getting stuck in the ice, Babb said.\u00a0 To determine where exactly the ice was coming from, scientists on the Amundsen found themselves jumping onto the thick masses of ice in the Atlantic and taking samples of the ice thickness, temperature, and salinity. From their analysis, they found this thicker ice had traveled from the Lincoln Sea in the high Arctic, which is north of Greenland.\u00a0 It's normal for thick masses of multiyear sea ice to travel down the west side of Greenland inside the frigid Nares Strait. Most winters, this ice gets blocked by natural ice dams that form in the narrow channel.\u00a0 But these natural ice dams didn't form in the winter of 2016-2017, allowing the ice to move through. The sizable ice chunks then traveled unhindered through the mostly ice-less Baffin and Labrador seas, eventually collecting around Newfoundland.\u00a0 Scientists collecting ice samples from a large mass of Arctic sea ice that had been transported into the North Atlantic.Image: David G. BarberThe sea ice was further propelled by a third factor: Two early-spring storms whose onshore winds thrust the ice toward Newfoundland.\u00a0 The Arctic sea ice extent in 2017-2018 has been some of the lowest since record-keeping began in 1979. January and February 2018 saw their lowest ice extents on record. And sometime later this century, scientists expect the Arctic to become completely ice-free during the summer months. But this doesn't mean vessels in the future will be safe from surges of ice, both from sea ice and land-based glaciers.\u00a0 Young and relatively thin sea ice will still form in the Arctic during winter, said Babb. This ice, which can be up to two meters (six and a half feet) thick, can bunch together and grow into deformed masses. And it too, explained Babb, might travel swiftly down iceless straits and pose risks to ships in the Atlantic.\u00a0 \"It's the same hazard but it's coming from a different source,\" Babb said. A graph showing this year's Arctic sea ice extent.Image: National snow and ice data centerScientists will once again board the Amundsen this spring, with plans to travel into Hudson Bay. This year, Babb said they've spoken with the Canadian Coast Guard who says there should be other icebreaking vessels in the area, should a surge of thick ice come down again from Arctic and entrap ships. \"We're leaving again to give it another shot,\" he said.

Senior Government scientists have said that full damaging effects of seaborne plastics is not yet known, but that it could be aiding the spread of bugs such as E.coli. Plastics is one of a number of environmental issues facing the world's seas, along with rising sea levels and warming oceans, and metal and chemical pollution, the Foresight Future of the Sea Report for the Government said. But it predicted there were also opportunities for the UK to cash in the global \"ocean economy\" - which is set to double to \u00a32 trillion by 2030 - in areas where the country is a world leader, such as offshore wind. The scientists behind the report warned of the danger of the oceans being \"out of sight, out of mind\", with more known about the surface of Mars and the Moon than the deep sea bed. The report found there were \"major opportunities\" for robotics, artificial intelligence and automated technology to fill gaps in understanding of ocean science. Work is also beginning on the impacts of plastic in the ocean, as experts are not sure what threats it poses, Professor Ian Boyd, chief scientific adviser for the Environment Department, said. Read more | Plastic pollution Plastic pollution, which is set to treble between 2015 and 2025 without intervention, has a physical presence in the oceans, and can accumulate on the coasts or in particular areas of the sea. But the toxic effects when they break down and end up inside marine organisms are not clear, he said. He added: \"Even in absence of research, there is a precautionary principle to take here, which is we should minimise the amount of plastic, both macro-plastic and micro-plastic, going into the marine environment, in order to make sure that if there are toxic effects, those are being dealt with.\" Efforts to reduce plastic pollution should focus on preventing it entering the sea, introducing new biodegradable plastics and public awareness campaigns about marine protection. More plastic is found on Britain's beaches each year Credit: Dan Kitwood Professor Ed Hill, executive director of the National Oceanography Centre, said it was time to change the attitude of what goes on below the surface as \"out of sight, out of mind\" and have more of a \"Mission to Planet Ocean\" approach. He said: \"When people get to see what is in the ocean, and the Blue Planet series and so on have helped people to visualise it, and then I think their reaction is twofold: one is complete wonder at what is there, and in other cases complete horror at what we're potentially doing to it. \"It's this sense of the unexplored world on our own planet, but also it's important to us, we know less about the bottom of the sea than the moon or Mars, but nothing lives on the moon or Mars, but things live in our ocean and they're vitally important to us.\"","published_at":1521590602,"content_id":"c0e34865-c9e0-3086-978f-c41856022717","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sea-plastic-set-treble-within-000100697.html","content_published_at":1521590460,"content_time":1521590460,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-33896e09-6c4a-38bc-8870-5458d6b10ed8_a-2ff368d9-7e9f-3c3a-a57b-37c22cc2e1f3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/puzzle-quantum-reality-1k2wpw6","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"NPR.org","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/13.7\/2018\/03\/20\/595286482\/the-puzzle-of-quantum-reality","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_yG7gdD6DpLerD.Z7fFk7Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QDsqkZEzWYkjrHNS5wjKEQ--\/dz0xNDAwO2g9Nzg2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2ff368d9-7e9f-3c3a-a57b-37c22cc2e1f3-1865271522.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NInihL8CwPYf9Bx1uHQLWA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03ODY7dz0xNDAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QDsqkZEzWYkjrHNS5wjKEQ--\/dz0xNDAwO2g9Nzg2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2ff368d9-7e9f-3c3a-a57b-37c22cc2e1f3-1865271522.jpeg","height":786,"width":1400,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QDsqkZEzWYkjrHNS5wjKEQ--\/dz0xNDAwO2g9Nzg2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2ff368d9-7e9f-3c3a-a57b-37c22cc2e1f3-1865271522.jpeg","imgw":1400,"imgh":786,"title":"The Puzzle Of Quantum Reality","summary":"There's a hole at the heart of quantum physics.

Based on the principles of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, this technique involves relying on a large distribution of matter (such as a galaxy cluster or star) to magnify the light coming from a distant object, thereby making it appear brighter and larger. However, in recent years, astronomers have found other uses for this technique as well. For instance, a team of scientists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) recently determined that Gravitational Lensing could also be used to determine the mass of white dwarf stars.

Current predictions say that the 19,000-pound lab should re-enter the earth's atmosphere sometime in the last few days of March or the first few days of April. The lab is called Tiangong-1, which means \"heavenly palace.\" China launched it into space in 2011. The outpost was briefly visited twice by Chinese taikonauts, including Wang Yaping, who beamed down a science lecture to schoolchildren. Although Tiangong-1 has been called a Chinese \"space station,\" it actually is just a precursor to China's planned space station, says Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor","published_at":1521564887,"content_id":"62c7eb57-cd03-3090-93fc-b0a87ef2733d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2018\/03\/20\/595190226\/a-chinese-space-lab-will-soon-fall-from-the-sky-where-it-lands-no-one-knows","content_published_at":1521564660,"content_time":1521564660,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

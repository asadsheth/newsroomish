By some estimates, NASA could afford 17 to 27 Falcon Heavy launches a year for what it is paying annually to develop the SLS rocket, which won't fly before 2020. Even President Trump has mused about the high costs of NASA's rocket. On Monday, during a committee meeting of NASA's Advisory Council, former Space Shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale raised this issue. Following a presentation by Bill Gerstenmaier, chief of human spaceflight for NASA, Hale asked whether the space agency wouldn't be better off going with the cheaper

It occurred when the North American ice sheet decayed after the last ice age and released meltwater into the North Atlantic Ocean, disrupting the currents that brought heat to Western Europe.

Working at Heriot-Watt University, they've created a system that uses sunlight to create hydrogen more cheaply and efficiently than before. Hydrogen is the lightest element in the Universe. A gas at room temperature, it burns with oxygen to give off heat and water vapour. (In air there are also small amounts of nitrogen oxide.) Unlike carbon-based fossil fuels, there is no carbon dioxide (CO2) to add to the planet's climate concerns. It is that feature which has made it a prime candidate to be a major part of our future energy supplies.

The beast probably evolved to hunt the herds of giant herbivores that roamed east Africa 200,000 years ago, according to the researchers who found its fossilised skull in Kenya. \u201cThis skull is the first indication of the existence of a population of giant lions,\u201d they said in a paper in the Journal of Paleontology. The researchers found the fossil at a site in Natodomeri, northwest Kenya. They used the remains of its teeth and skull to calculate its size \u2014 which was far larger than modern lions. \u201cThe skull is remarkable for its very great size, equivalent to the","published_at":1522006193,"content_id":"66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/kenyan-fossil-reveals-lions-as-tall-as-humans-jgvdl6m6d","content_published_at":1521954000,"content_time":1521954000,"content_relative_time":60,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-45c8ff89-c07c-33f2-941e-c7ca84db95c7_a-55661eb2-af30-3112-bfde-978b8f7dd6db","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/why-african-farmers-balance-pesticides-2r2eygz","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The M&G Online","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/mg.co.za\/article\/2018-03-25-why-african-farmers-should-balance-pesticides-with-other-control-methods","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/re_Pa2c7vjs2knBbPsYyTA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YXSIvXLrJHQrHzdmJEVooQ--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55661eb2-af30-3112-bfde-978b8f7dd6db--1905159578.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.Wb_az4fbxCoLiRUTt_Yaw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NTA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YXSIvXLrJHQrHzdmJEVooQ--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55661eb2-af30-3112-bfde-978b8f7dd6db--1905159578.jpeg","height":450,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YXSIvXLrJHQrHzdmJEVooQ--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55661eb2-af30-3112-bfde-978b8f7dd6db--1905159578.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":450,"title":"Why African farmers should balance pesticides with other control methods","summary":"Insect pests cause almost half of the crop losses in Africa. If the continent is to feed its growing population, farmers must find ways to control them. Pests account for high losses in other developing regions too. For smallholder farmers in particular, pest management needs to be affordable, safe and sustainable. It should avoid the drawbacks of synthetic pesticides as far as possible. Research is now showing that integrated approaches can achieve these goals. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, for example, recently launched a comprehensive guide that will help millions of smallholder farmers across Africa to manage the fall armyworm. This is a new insect pest in over 30 African countries","published_at":1522000966,"content_id":"55661eb2-af30-3112-bfde-978b8f7dd6db","content_url":"https:\/\/mg.co.za\/article\/2018-03-25-why-african-farmers-should-balance-pesticides-with-other-control-methods","content_published_at":1522000080,"content_time":1522000080,"content_relative_time":47,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b063882a-0201-3b9c-b5a7-1fbb8d01aa36_a-10677cc3-5988-3443-bc73-1b86cfac2499","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/national-geographics-brilliant-one-strange-6zjgeov","author":"third_watch","provider":"pastemagazine.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.pastemagazine.com\/articles\/2018\/03\/national-geographic-one-strange-rock-will-change-t.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AaFkfPginTk0_P7tLdFZ8A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SZhW_TCMib3cOluzT67Zvg--\/dz02MzM7aD0zNTY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_10677cc3-5988-3443-bc73-1b86cfac2499--87221390.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wEg40QrcpDt52JoNv8852g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNTY7dz02MzM7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SZhW_TCMib3cOluzT67Zvg--\/dz02MzM7aD0zNTY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_10677cc3-5988-3443-bc73-1b86cfac2499--87221390.jpeg","height":356,"width":633,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SZhW_TCMib3cOluzT67Zvg--\/dz02MzM7aD0zNTY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_10677cc3-5988-3443-bc73-1b86cfac2499--87221390.jpeg","imgw":633,"imgh":356,"title":"National Geographic's Brilliant One Strange Rock Will Change the Way You Look at Your Planet","summary":"Earlier this year, Sir David Attenborough took American audiences back into the depths of the oceans with the spectacular Blue Planet II. The message of ambitious, large-scale natural history programming is almost always a reminder that we are inherently and intricately connected to other forms of life on the only planet we currently know to be a home to living things. For a beautifully orchestrated macrocosmic counterpoint, I strongly recommend you tune in to National Geographic\u00a0Channel's One Strange Rock. This 10-part epic (director Darren Aronofsky\u00a0has called it \u201ca visual Bible\u201d) is dedicated to asking\u2014and in some cases even positing answers to\u2014the big questions about how the world works.

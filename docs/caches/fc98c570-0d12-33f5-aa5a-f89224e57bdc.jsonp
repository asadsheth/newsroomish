CMB-S4 will be designed to cross critical thresholds in testing inflation, determining the number and masses of the neutrinos, constraining possible new light relic particles, providing precise constraints on the nature of dark energy, and testing general relativity on large scales. The first goal and requirement for CMB-S4 is to measure the imprint of primordial gravitational waves on the CMB polarization anisotropy, quantified by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. The r requirements have been translated into measurement requirements consistent with projecting out foregrounds and other contamination.","published_at":1521465031,"content_id":"d4b5e677-62f9-3058-bf12-9e9de3f04b69","content_url":"https:\/\/www.nextbigfuture.com\/2018\/03\/ground-based-superconducting-cameras-and-telescopes-for-measure-cmb-with-100-times-more-sensitivity.html","content_published_at":1521440043,"content_time":1521440043,"content_relative_time":41,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-aa273178-3210-3add-919f-5c27fce96c7c_a-6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-aa273178-3210-3add-919f-5c27fce96c7c_a-6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","author":"third_watch","provider":"Washington Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/obituaries\/stephen-hawking-physicist-who-came-to-symbolize-the-power-of-the-human-mind-dies-at-76\/2018\/03\/14\/d4298e14-273a-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.882d0416624c&utm_term=.b5ab3e257316&tid=ss_tw","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Stephen Hawking, physicist who came to symbolize the power of the human mind, dies at 76","summary":"Stephen W. Hawking, the British theoretical physicist who overcame a devastating neurological disease to probe the greatest mysteries of the cosmos and become a globally celebrated symbol of the power of the human mind, died March 14 at his home in Cambridge, England. Unable to move nearly all his muscles, speechless but for a computer-synthesized voice, Dr. Hawking had suffered since the age of 21 from a degenerative motor neuron disease similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. Initially given two years to live, a diagnosis that threw him into a profound depression, he found the strength to complete his doctorate and rise to the position of Lucasian professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, the same post held by Isaac Newton 300 years earlier.","published_at":1521458750,"content_id":"6a448dcd-439d-3c3d-aa9f-2879eb675d9f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/obituaries\/stephen-hawking-physicist-who-came-to-symbolize-the-power-of-the-human-mind-dies-at-76\/2018\/03\/14\/d4298e14-273a-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.882d0416624c&utm_term=.b5ab3e257316&tid=ss_tw","content_published_at":1521043260,"content_time":1521043260,"content_relative_time":151,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-ad20653c-8b39-3d13-ac57-b2cb7f990821_a-e61231a8-9e3a-32cf-8027-65ecef7169fa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-ad20653c-8b39-3d13-ac57-b2cb7f990821_a-e61231a8-9e3a-32cf-8027-65ecef7169fa","author":"nanook","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/stephen-hawking-leaves-behind-apos-172703588.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LVXELeYkykta1Fe83F_I0w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/84ab7035e50a81f461894c8820821ee4","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mkj7xugKiD4WwcITqbMxpw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/84ab7035e50a81f461894c8820821ee4","height":1563,"width":2501,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/84ab7035e50a81f461894c8820821ee4","imgw":2501,"imgh":1563,"title":"Stephen Hawking leaves behind 'breathtaking' final multiverse theory","summary":"A final theory explaining how mankind might detect parallel universes was completed by Stephen Hawking shortly before he died, it has emerged. Colleagues have revealed the renowned theoretical physicist\u2019s final academic work was to set out the groundbreaking mathematics needed for a spacecraft to find traces of multiple big bangs. Currently being reviewed by a leading scientific journal, the paper, named A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation, may turn out to be Hawking\u2019s most important scientific legacy. The new paper is a bid to clear up an issue thrown up by Hawking's 1983 \"no-boundaries\" theory Credit: Barcroft Images Fellow researchers have said that if the evidence which the new theory promises had been discovered before Hawking died last week, it may have secured the Nobel Prize which had eluded him for so long. The new paper seeks to resolve an issue thrown up by Hawking\u2019s 1983 \u201cno-boundary\u201d theory which described how the universe burst into existence with the big bang. According to that account, the universe instantaneously expanded from a tiny point into a prototype of what we live in today, a process known as inflation. But the theory also predicted an infinite number of big bangs, each creating their own universe, a \u201cmultiverse\u201d, which presented a mathematical paradox because it is seemingly impossible to measure. Read more | Professor Stephen Hawking Carlos Frenk, professor of cosmology at Durham University, told The Sunday Times: The intriguing idea in Hawking\u2019s paper is that [the multiverse] left its imprint on the background radiation permeating our universe and we could measure it with a detector on a spaceship. \u201cThese ideas offer the breathtaking prospect of finding evidence for the existence of other universe.\u201d Professor Thomas Hertog, from KU Leuven University in Belgium, worked with Hawking on the new theory and said he met the Cambridge scientist two weeks ago to discuss its final approval. \u201cThis was Stephen: to boldly go where Star Trek fears to tread,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has often been nominated for the Nobel and should have won it. Now he never can.\u201d In quotes | Stephen Hawking Despite the hopeful promise of Hawking\u2019s final work, it also comes with the depressing prediction that, ultimately, the universe will fade into blackness as stars simply run out of energy. He died last Wednesday in Cambridge at the age of 76, having suffered from a rare form of motor neurone disease since 1964. He eventually became confined to a wheelchair and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication. His most famous popular, A Brief History of Time, was published in 1988 and sold more than 10 million copies within 20 years.","published_at":1521458357,"content_id":"e61231a8-9e3a-32cf-8027-65ecef7169fa","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/stephen-hawking-leaves-behind-apos-172703588.html","content_published_at":1521394023,"content_time":1521394023,"content_relative_time":54,"reaction_count":6,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

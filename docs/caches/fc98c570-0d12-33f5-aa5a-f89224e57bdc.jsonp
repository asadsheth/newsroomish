Unfortunately, there's been no concrete evidence of life ever having existed on the Red Planet \u2014 that is, if you believe the official version of things. Barry DiGregorio, a researcher with the University of Buckingham, doesn't buy it, and he says he's already discovered clues to Mars' past in the form of fossilized alien tracks. Now, he's trying to get others on board with his theory and blow the top off of an alleged NASA cover-up in the process. DiGregorio, an author who has published books on Mars and its potential to host life, believes previously-released NASA imagery from the planet offers clear evidence of Martian tracks. He believes photos showing small indentations in rock are actually long-fossilized footprints of some type of alien life. \"Put it this way, these images, these figures, have not been seen on Mars to date,\" DiGregorio told the Daily Star. \"One of the things that grabbed me immediately was the expediency that NASA left the area of such a mission.\" NASA, meanwhile, is doing its best to remain level headed as it explains why DiGregorio has lost his marbles. The \"tracks\" that are at the heart of this debate are actually much smaller than might be obvious from the photographs, and NASA claims that they are actually only about the size of a sesame seed. The agency believes the odd shapes to be the byproduct of crystal formations in the rock, and points to similar crystals found here on Earth that bear a striking resemblance to what DiGregorio believes are alien footprints. \"These shapes are characteristic of gypsum crystals,\" Sanjeev Gupta of the NASA's Mars Curiosity science team explains. \"These can form when salts become concentrated in water, such as in an evaporating lake.\" Of course, DiGregorio isn't buying that totally reasonable explanation and has instead decided to present his findings at a conference later this year, hoping to drum up support for his theory among other scientists. That's a bold strategy, and we'll see if it pays off.","published_at":1520265647,"content_id":"ef9766f4-f4c1-3484-933c-bb72d7b38644","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/scientist-says-found-fossilized-alien-footprints-mars-blames-155915649.html","content_published_at":1520265555,"content_time":1520265555,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-d298518f-1283-3053-b0e4-3ffea12e16d4_a-55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/launches-sky-events-more-9csdhuk","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Space.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/32286-space-calendar.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BO_n7T5cHRQWNFyIeNQ66A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FNKL9tHzozjkDcp_HEcNg--\/dz0xNzc3O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990-255755068.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oWXdAZqSHE9JI0Gca5NAdA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTc3Nzs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FNKL9tHzozjkDcp_HEcNg--\/dz0xNzc3O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990-255755068.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1777,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FNKL9tHzozjkDcp_HEcNg--\/dz0xNzc3O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990-255755068.jpeg","imgw":1777,"imgh":1000,"title":"Space Calendar 2018: Launches, Sky Events & More","summary":"LAST UPDATED March 6:\u00a0These dates are subject to change, and will be updated throughout the year as firmer dates arise.\u00a0Please DO NOT schedule travel based on a date you see here.\u00a0Launch dates collected from NASA, ESA, Roscosmos,\u00a0Spaceflight Now\u00a0and others.\u00a0 Watch NASA webcasts and other live launch\u00a0coverage\u00a0on our Watch Live page, and see our\u00a0night sky webcasts here.

The study was published in Molecular Psychiatry. \"Our studies reveal that in complex brain disorders that have a loss of many genes, a single deleted gene is sufficient to cause symptoms for the patients,\" said Karun Singh, study co-author and researcher with McMaster's Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute.","published_at":1520262369,"content_id":"3c7590e4-ea33-3095-a87f-f91e61182c33","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-03-gene-responsible-neurodevelopmental-disorders-autism.html","content_published_at":1520273912,"content_time":1520273912,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-cb6c19c1-b24d-3672-a9b9-2eac686bda50_a-49e8fd29-7200-3865-8258-6d181bbb8c73","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/individual-atoms-may-turn-carbon-25pgov2","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"cosmosmagazine.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/cosmosmagazine.com\/physics\/individual-atoms-may-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-an-energy-source","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rhWg6FOWcfM9wGgtcn7BVg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BV6FhetpQJcqwCsMUp2B2w--\/dz0zNjA7aD0zNjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_49e8fd29-7200-3865-8258-6d181bbb8c73--1760470623.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/te9Jwq7_Ej_sfjdo1RZJ4A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz0zNjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BV6FhetpQJcqwCsMUp2B2w--\/dz0zNjA7aD0zNjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_49e8fd29-7200-3865-8258-6d181bbb8c73--1760470623.jpeg","height":360,"width":360,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BV6FhetpQJcqwCsMUp2B2w--\/dz0zNjA7aD0zNjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_49e8fd29-7200-3865-8258-6d181bbb8c73--1760470623.jpeg","imgw":360,"imgh":360,"title":"Individual atoms may turn carbon dioxide into an energy","summary":"A radical new catalyst design has been shown to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, potentially allowing it to be translated into a valuable energy source.

Hawking's answer to the question \"What was there before there was anything?\" relies on a theory known as the \"no-boundary proposal.\" \"The boundary condition of the universe ... is that it has no boundary,\" Hawking","published_at":1520042790,"content_id":"e5cd3381-06b0-3536-bc91-800059b06faf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/39876-stephen-hawking-neil-degrasse-tyson-beginning-of-time.html","content_published_at":1520042160,"content_time":1520042160,"content_relative_time":92,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-542fa436-c491-3a42-ac64-120112f7a445_a-a770f49f-0ef4-3764-a4e2-91a8dfcc531b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/space-catapult-startup-spinlaunch-come-503wbqq","author":"third_watch","provider":"Universe Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/138687\/space-catapult-startup-spinlaunch-come-stealth-mode-space-catapults-yes-please\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RRfo9tb6mLd7Gj8nsr6jyw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gQ9I0L9yiFQCa2TZURdhIQ--\/dz0xMjc5O2g9NzI3O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a770f49f-0ef4-3764-a4e2-91a8dfcc531b--292793961.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hb0P_KeRUQV9WADI6R5e_A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Mjc7dz0xMjc5Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gQ9I0L9yiFQCa2TZURdhIQ--\/dz0xMjc5O2g9NzI3O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a770f49f-0ef4-3764-a4e2-91a8dfcc531b--292793961.jpeg","height":727,"width":1279,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gQ9I0L9yiFQCa2TZURdhIQ--\/dz0xMjc5O2g9NzI3O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a770f49f-0ef4-3764-a4e2-91a8dfcc531b--292793961.jpeg","imgw":1279,"imgh":727,"title":"Space Catapult Startup SpinLaunch has Come Out of Stealth Mode.

When it comes right down to it, launching disposable rockets from Earth and getting them to the point where they can achieve escape velocity and reach space is expensive. In addition, these rockets need to be big, powerful, and be able to hold a lot of fuel in order to lift spacecraft or cargo. It is for this reason that so many efforts in the past few decades have been focused on reducing costs of individual launches. Between reusable rockets and reusable spacecraft (i.e the Space Shuttle), there are plenty of ways to make launch vehicles cheaper.

It's prevalence will further alter Earth's climate, specifically precipitation patterns. To better understand the influence of water vapor on the planet's climate, scientists are looking to the past. \"If we want to understand how the Earth would work with a climate substantially warmer than today,","published_at":1520022351,"content_id":"73ac3f34-331b-3228-b793-6572a557e48d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Science_News\/2018\/03\/02\/Fossilized-plant-leaf-wax-to-help-scientists-study-ancient-climates\/5861520002258\/","content_published_at":1520012365,"content_time":1520012365,"content_relative_time":101,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-10975f84-a05a-3dbc-b893-ec7209114c3a_a-109e9c6f-2fc6-385a-89e6-abf373cbbc87","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/could-bold-technique-boost-gravitational-4lt1rxt","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Space.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/39867-gravitational-wave-detection-new-technique.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3My0umWrNisMLK4NgdNPeQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yl0i7KOZpZcElKG8_Dm7jA--\/dz0xNzc4O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_109e9c6f-2fc6-385a-89e6-abf373cbbc87--653801626.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MEvMv0nRHrVVmsR1WCzjTA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTc3ODs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yl0i7KOZpZcElKG8_Dm7jA--\/dz0xNzc4O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_109e9c6f-2fc6-385a-89e6-abf373cbbc87--653801626.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1778,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yl0i7KOZpZcElKG8_Dm7jA--\/dz0xNzc4O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_109e9c6f-2fc6-385a-89e6-abf373cbbc87--653801626.jpeg","imgw":1778,"imgh":1000,"title":"Could This Bold New Technique Boost Gravitational-Wave Detection?","summary":"Gravitational waves that we can detect here on Earth are generated by the most energetic events in the cosmos, from colliding black holes to merging neutron stars.\u00a0 To spot these space-time ripples, which have traveled billions of light-years in some cases, scientists must build some of the most sensitive equipment the world has ever seen.

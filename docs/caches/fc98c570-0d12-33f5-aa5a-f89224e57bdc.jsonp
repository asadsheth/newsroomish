That marks the longest time NASA has gone without a presidential appointee leading the agency. SEE ALSO: Trump's pick to lead NASA reveals controversial global warming views The vote played out mostly along party lines, with 50 votes going for Bridenstine, and 49 against. This is a very partisan result for confirmation of a NASA administrator, and it could put him in a relatively weak position when taking over the agency. Bridenstine's confirmation was spurred on by the fact that NASA's acting administrator Robert Lightfoot decided to retire at the end of April, potentially leaving a major leadership gap at the agency.\u00a0 Bridenstine's appointment was met with resistance in the Senate from the beginning.\u00a0 Senators on both sides of the aisle argued that Bridenstine is too politically divisive, wasn't qualified to lead such a large organization, and has no scientific experience to speak of. Democrats were, for the most part, firmly against his appointment from the start. Even some Republicans were against Bridenstine before ultimately voting in favor of him. \u201cWhile I wish the President would have nominated a space professional to run NASA, the unexpected April 30 retirement of the Acting Administrator would leave NASA, an agency whose mission is vital to Florida, with a gaping leadership void unless we confirm a new Administrator,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, said in a statement ahead of the vote.\u00a0 \"Because of this I decided to support the nomination of Rep. Bridenstine. I expect him to lead NASA in a non-political way and to treat Florida fairly.\u201d The former congressman is known for his divisive politics and controversial views on climate change and LGBTQ rights.\u00a0 A recent investigation by the Daily Beast also found that Bridenstine mismanaged the Tulsa Air and Space Museum, using the nonprofit to financially benefit himself.\u00a0 Democrats hammered Bridenstine for his views on LGBTQ rights during committee hearings.\u00a0 \"You're going to be in a position not just managing people, but at least in my eyes, you're up for an office to be one of the most inspiring leaders in America, where children will look to you,\" Sen. Cory Booker said during a November hearing. \"...Tell me how you think a child will view a leader who thinks they are immoral or engaging in immoral acts.\" Bridenstine co-sponsored a bill that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, and he was against the order made by former President Barack Obama allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that most closely corresponds with their gender identity, not what's written on their birth certificates. This record is particularly troubling in light of the fact that Bridenstine will be responsible for ensuring the wellbeing of the approximately 18,000 public servants working for NASA, many of whom likely identify as something other than straight or cisgender. \u00a0 While Bridenstine's views on climate change have evolved somewhat, they still don't fully align with the clear scientific consensus supported by data gathered by many NASA missions and scientists over the years. In November, Bridenstine agreed that humans have contributed to climate change, but he stopped short of agreeing that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are the main cause of global warming. As the already embattled leader takes on his new role, we'll see exactly how much his views evolve as the agency moves forward and what that means for those who work with him.

Forensic scans reveal mystery death","summary":"The world\u2019s most famous dodo, which inspired Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, met an\u00a0untimely and murderous end, scientists have discovered. The Oxford Dodo is the most well-preserved example of the extinct bird on Earth and still contains soft tissue and DNA which could be used one day to resurrect the species. It was always thought the Oxford Dodo survived the fate of its kin, and was brought back alive from Mauritius, ending up as an exotic curiosity on the streets of London.\u00a0 Dodos survive such as this one auctioned in West Sussex in 2016 but only the Oxford dodo still has DNA Credit: \u00a0Gareth Fuller In 1638 the MP Sir Hamon L\u2019Estrange wrote that he had paid a penny to view a \u2018strange fowle\u2019 near Lincoln Inns Fields, claiming it ate stones as big as nutmegs to aid digestion. After it died naturally it ended up in the collection of John Tradescant, gardener of King Charles II, whose curiosities were passed to Elias Ashmole, who used them to found Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean Museum. \u00a0Finally in 1860 the remains of the bird moved to the Oxford University of Natural History. Scans show lead shot in the dodo's head\u00a0 Credit: University of Warwick But when researchers at the University of Warwick were asked to scan the head of the dodo, they found clear evidence of pellets in its skull. Subsequent analysis of the material and size of the particles revealed that they were lead shot, typically used to hunt wildfowl during the 17th century. The clear implication is that the bird either never made it to Britain alive or was shot sometime after its arrival. Professor Paul Smith, Director of Oxford University Museum of Natural History, said: \u201cWe thought we knew the specimen, so it was a really great surprise when the researchers came and it had lots of millimetre diameter lead pellets embedded within the skin and the bone. It rapidly became apparent this was lead shot from a gun. \u201cRegarding where it was shot, the truth is we don\u2019t know but it raises more questions. If it was shot in London, why? And if it was shot in Mauritius, how did they preserve the specimen?\u201d The dodo species was first discovered by the Dutch in 1598, but was recorded as extinct by 1662. Although it was originally thought that hunters were to blame, revisionist histories suggest that dogs and rats from ships ate the eggs, wiping out the species. However the new evidence may show the bird was hunted after all.\u00a0 Dodos became extinct in the 1860s\u00a0 The Oxford dodo is not just scientifically significant but also culturally important. The mathematician Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) would regularly visit the Oxford University Museum of Natural History with his young muse Alice Liddel, and wrote the bird into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a caricature of himself. It also appears in Hilaire Belloc\u2019s Bad Child\u2019s Book of Beasts. Too precious to be on permanent display it remains in storage and is moved every few weeks to discourage theft. The team had originally scanned the dodo\u2019s head hoping to create a three dimensional skull which would reveal more about its evolutionary past and also how it fed. But the results uncovered something far more interesting. The dodo is the only one in the world with soft tissue and DNA still present\u00a0 Credit: The University of Warwick Prof Mark Williams: \u201cWe were astounded to find that when we looked at the scans in close detail there were some mysterious pellets buried in the back of its head. The dodo had actually been shot. \u201cAlthough the results were initially shocking, it was exciting to be able to reveal such an important part of the story in the life of the world\u2019s most famous extinct bird. \u201c It just goes to show that when you are carrying out investigative research, you never quite know what you are going to find.\u201d The team now plan to use forensic analysis usually reserved for crime scenes to work out where the the bird was killed. Prof Smith added: \u201cThe Oxford Dodo is the iconic representation of dodos, it\u2019s the most complete, it\u2019s the only one we can get DNA form. \u201cIt is the only one we can do molecular analysis to work out relationships and potentially to reconstruct the genome of dodos. \u201cThe next step is to do some chemical analysis of the lead shot and using those we may be able to trace which particular orefield the lead came form and therefore what country it was mined in and what country the shot was made in so we could then determine who killed the dodo.\u201d","published_at":1524179009,"content_id":"72bcde85-e670-3a2a-b1f6-5f8dac889e90","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/shot-lewis-carroll-dodo-forensic-230107767.html","content_published_at":1524178860,"content_time":1524178860,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-777ceada-7fb5-3efc-926b-ff2849f4800a_a-719a6180-70e2-3a65-acf5-fc773c9d767b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/us-army-first-ever-combustion-10cxjhm","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"NextBigFuture.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.nextbigfuture.com\/2018\/04\/us-army-has-first-ever-combustion-experiment-with-x-rays.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DMLYjm5gdASEwQkCodoeMA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vrGagz30K9SHdh2IhI06ag--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NDk0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_719a6180-70e2-3a65-acf5-fc773c9d767b-1920828517.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lS7WD7A63BJKvoL4xqgfOQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00OTQ7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vrGagz30K9SHdh2IhI06ag--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NDk0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_719a6180-70e2-3a65-acf5-fc773c9d767b-1920828517.jpeg","height":494,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vrGagz30K9SHdh2IhI06ag--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NDk0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_719a6180-70e2-3a65-acf5-fc773c9d767b-1920828517.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":494,"title":"US Army has first-ever combustion experiment with X-rays","summary":"The U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Propulsion made an historic first with its experiment in a gas turbine combustor using X-rays.

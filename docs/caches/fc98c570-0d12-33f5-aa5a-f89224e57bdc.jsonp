The research contradicts a forensic analysis of the remains in 1941 that described the bones as belonging to a male. The bones, which were subsequently lost, continue to be a source of debate.

There is a decisive and growing fissure in America right now as climate change science and federal climate change policy move steadily in opposite directions. In his first year in office, President Donald Trump has shirked all responsibility on the issue, rejecting or beginning to dismantle President Obama's signature climate policies: the Paris climate agreement and the Clean Power Plan, the main domestic policy for limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

Unfortunately, there's been no concrete evidence of life ever having existed on the Red Planet \u2014 that is, if you believe the official version of things. Barry DiGregorio, a researcher with the University of Buckingham, doesn't buy it, and he says he's already discovered clues to Mars' past in the form of fossilized alien tracks. Now, he's trying to get others on board with his theory and blow the top off of an alleged NASA cover-up in the process. DiGregorio, an author who has published books on Mars and its potential to host life, believes previously-released NASA imagery from the planet offers clear evidence of Martian tracks. He believes photos showing small indentations in rock are actually long-fossilized footprints of some type of alien life. \"Put it this way, these images, these figures, have not been seen on Mars to date,\" DiGregorio told the Daily Star. \"One of the things that grabbed me immediately was the expediency that NASA left the area of such a mission.\" NASA, meanwhile, is doing its best to remain level headed as it explains why DiGregorio has lost his marbles. The \"tracks\" that are at the heart of this debate are actually much smaller than might be obvious from the photographs, and NASA claims that they are actually only about the size of a sesame seed. The agency believes the odd shapes to be the byproduct of crystal formations in the rock, and points to similar crystals found here on Earth that bear a striking resemblance to what DiGregorio believes are alien footprints. \"These shapes are characteristic of gypsum crystals,\" Sanjeev Gupta of the NASA's Mars Curiosity science team explains. \"These can form when salts become concentrated in water, such as in an evaporating lake.\" Of course, DiGregorio isn't buying that totally reasonable explanation and has instead decided to present his findings at a conference later this year, hoping to drum up support for his theory among other scientists. That's a bold strategy, and we'll see if it pays off.","published_at":1520265647,"content_id":"ef9766f4-f4c1-3484-933c-bb72d7b38644","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/scientist-says-found-fossilized-alien-footprints-mars-blames-155915649.html","content_published_at":1520265555,"content_time":1520265555,"content_relative_time":56,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-d298518f-1283-3053-b0e4-3ffea12e16d4_a-55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/launches-sky-events-more-9csdhuk","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Space.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/32286-space-calendar.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BO_n7T5cHRQWNFyIeNQ66A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FNKL9tHzozjkDcp_HEcNg--\/dz0xNzc3O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990-255755068.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oWXdAZqSHE9JI0Gca5NAdA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTc3Nzs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FNKL9tHzozjkDcp_HEcNg--\/dz0xNzc3O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990-255755068.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1777,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8FNKL9tHzozjkDcp_HEcNg--\/dz0xNzc3O2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55dcdb08-f380-3b66-9689-480a2b03a990-255755068.jpeg","imgw":1777,"imgh":1000,"title":"Space Calendar 2018: Launches, Sky Events & More","summary":"LAST UPDATED March 6:\u00a0These dates are subject to change, and will be updated throughout the year as firmer dates arise.\u00a0Please DO NOT schedule travel based on a date you see here.\u00a0Launch dates collected from NASA, ESA, Roscosmos,\u00a0Spaceflight Now\u00a0and others.\u00a0 Watch NASA webcasts and other live launch\u00a0coverage\u00a0on our Watch Live page, and see our\u00a0night sky webcasts here.

But new breakthroughs at a UW material sciences lab could place tissue paper at the forefront of motion sensing technology.\u00a0 The research team recently unveiled new, wearable, tissue paper motion sensors that differ from other designs in that the paper is used as the substrate, instead of the silicon bases that are widely used by other labs. Carbon nanotubes are applied to the substrate and then connected to electrodes that can sense changes in the current resulting from movement. Existing sensors for wearable motion detection lack key characteristics","published_at":1520137429,"content_id":"227db2d1-9a93-3fc6-b0c3-87db7eb75587","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailyuw.com\/science\/article_65606c42-1cfd-11e8-bc5d-f3b571bfafce.html","content_published_at":1519891200,"content_time":1519891200,"content_relative_time":160,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e4680352-5695-3501-bcc8-d7cb15249ef1_a-0037ee21-104b-34e7-8a2b-9e66400b039f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e4680352-5695-3501-bcc8-d7cb15249ef1_a-0037ee21-104b-34e7-8a2b-9e66400b039f","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Conde Nast","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/scott-kelly-answers-astronaut-questions-163036403.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LjE4BLJ97Xpc2uQhjxLY_g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/conde_nast_square_videos_135\/d6921acd3e171091268a709c6345bcef","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3DtCj7sFwV4top2kz3M2iQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTA4MDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/conde_nast_square_videos_135\/d6921acd3e171091268a709c6345bcef","height":1080,"width":1080,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/conde_nast_square_videos_135\/d6921acd3e171091268a709c6345bcef","imgw":1080,"imgh":1080,"title":"Scott Kelly Answers Astronaut Questions From Twitter","summary":null,"published_at":1520137146,"content_id":"0037ee21-104b-34e7-8a2b-9e66400b039f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/scott-kelly-answers-astronaut-questions-163036403.html","content_published_at":1519742789,"content_time":1519742789,"content_relative_time":201,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"video_link","aspect":1},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-863e9b9b-334f-34e9-a06b-18598c194ce2_a-c19bae23-5224-3dfc-b1bd-db991c1b0182","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/akoustis-achieves-company-wide-iso-2vq3bzq","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"morningstar.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/news\/globe-news-wire\/GNW_7162121\/akoustis-achieves-companywide-iso-90012015-certification.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Akoustis Achieves Company-Wide ISO 9001:2015 Certification","summary":"Charlotte, NC, Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akoustis Technologies, Inc.

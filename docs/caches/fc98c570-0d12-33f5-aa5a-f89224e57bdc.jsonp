Forensic scans reveal mystery death","summary":"The world\u2019s most famous dodo, which inspired Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, met an\u00a0untimely and murderous end, scientists have discovered. The Oxford Dodo is the most well-preserved example of the extinct bird on Earth and still contains soft tissue and DNA which could be used one day to resurrect the species. It was always thought the Oxford Dodo survived the fate of its kin, and was brought back alive from Mauritius, ending up as an exotic curiosity on the streets of London.\u00a0 Dodos survive such as this one auctioned in West Sussex in 2016 but only the Oxford dodo still has DNA Credit: \u00a0Gareth Fuller In 1638 the MP Sir Hamon L\u2019Estrange wrote that he had paid a penny to view a \u2018strange fowle\u2019 near Lincoln Inns Fields, claiming it ate stones as big as nutmegs to aid digestion. After it died naturally it ended up in the collection of John Tradescant, gardener of King Charles II, whose curiosities were passed to Elias Ashmole, who used them to found Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean Museum. \u00a0Finally in 1860 the remains of the bird moved to the Oxford University of Natural History. Scans show lead shot in the dodo's head\u00a0 Credit: University of Warwick But when researchers at the University of Warwick were asked to scan the head of the dodo, they found clear evidence of pellets in its skull. Subsequent analysis of the material and size of the particles revealed that they were lead shot, typically used to hunt wildfowl during the 17th century. The clear implication is that the bird either never made it to Britain alive or was shot sometime after its arrival. Professor Paul Smith, Director of Oxford University Museum of Natural History, said: \u201cWe thought we knew the specimen, so it was a really great surprise when the researchers came and it had lots of millimetre diameter lead pellets embedded within the skin and the bone. It rapidly became apparent this was lead shot from a gun. \u201cRegarding where it was shot, the truth is we don\u2019t know but it raises more questions. If it was shot in London, why? And if it was shot in Mauritius, how did they preserve the specimen?\u201d The dodo species was first discovered by the Dutch in 1598, but was recorded as extinct by 1662. Although it was originally thought that hunters were to blame, revisionist histories suggest that dogs and rats from ships ate the eggs, wiping out the species. However the new evidence may show the bird was hunted after all.\u00a0 Dodos became extinct in the 1860s\u00a0 The Oxford dodo is not just scientifically significant but also culturally important. The mathematician Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) would regularly visit the Oxford University Museum of Natural History with his young muse Alice Liddel, and wrote the bird into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a caricature of himself. It also appears in Hilaire Belloc\u2019s Bad Child\u2019s Book of Beasts. Too precious to be on permanent display it remains in storage and is moved every few weeks to discourage theft. The team had originally scanned the dodo\u2019s head hoping to create a three dimensional skull which would reveal more about its evolutionary past and also how it fed. But the results uncovered something far more interesting. The dodo is the only one in the world with soft tissue and DNA still present\u00a0 Credit: The University of Warwick Prof Mark Williams: \u201cWe were astounded to find that when we looked at the scans in close detail there were some mysterious pellets buried in the back of its head. The dodo had actually been shot. \u201cAlthough the results were initially shocking, it was exciting to be able to reveal such an important part of the story in the life of the world\u2019s most famous extinct bird. \u201c It just goes to show that when you are carrying out investigative research, you never quite know what you are going to find.\u201d The team now plan to use forensic analysis usually reserved for crime scenes to work out where the the bird was killed.

In fact, heart attacks, strokes and related diseases will kill an estimated 610,000 Americans this year alone. Some medications help, but to better tackle this problem, researchers need to know exactly how the heart and blood vessels stay healthy in the first place. Now, scientists at The Scripps Research Institute have identified a protein, called GPR68, that senses blood flow and tells small blood vessels called arterioles when to dilate. The researchers believe medications that activate GPR68 could one day be useful to treat medical conditions, including ischemic stroke. \"It has been known for decades that blood vessels","published_at":1524162160,"content_id":"1836f9fb-07fa-31d7-9f64-512db95b9049","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-04-molecule-dilates-blood-vessels-hints.html","content_published_at":1524153612,"content_time":1524153612,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b0caa5be-8795-3dd4-a170-f14e0dfb3306_a-aaeedf4b-46d3-3002-b343-2c0c36c24f4f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b0caa5be-8795-3dd4-a170-f14e0dfb3306_a-aaeedf4b-46d3-3002-b343-2c0c36c24f4f","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"NPR.org","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2018\/04\/19\/604031141\/new-study-says-ancient-humans-hunted-big-mammals-to-extinction","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rgqQFt9_FyhlrguoR_j4CA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/B2E6aAysNhZsJ0DKYMOpHg--\/dz0xNDAwO2g9Nzg2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_aaeedf4b-46d3-3002-b343-2c0c36c24f4f-1340937850.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.93O8tUk.U4.B7Ng2rGwXg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03ODY7dz0xNDAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/B2E6aAysNhZsJ0DKYMOpHg--\/dz0xNDAwO2g9Nzg2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_aaeedf4b-46d3-3002-b343-2c0c36c24f4f-1340937850.jpeg","height":786,"width":1400,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/B2E6aAysNhZsJ0DKYMOpHg--\/dz0xNDAwO2g9Nzg2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_aaeedf4b-46d3-3002-b343-2c0c36c24f4f-1340937850.jpeg","imgw":1400,"imgh":786,"title":"New Study Says Ancient Humans Hunted Big Mammals To Extinction","summary":"Over the past 125,000 years, the average size of mammals on the Earth has shrunk.

Scientists at Stanford University have discovered that the brain sends out a distinct signal in the seconds before a burst of impulsive behaviour. The electrical activity occurs in an area of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, the reward centre which reinforces survival-promoting actions like obtaining food or sex, by flooding the body with anticipatory pleasure. That pleasure can be so intensive that it often overrides concerns about social consequences. But now scientists have discovered what the signal looks like and how it can be switched off. The researchers showed that supplying a small electrical pulse to the nucleus accumbens as soon as the electrical signal occurs, prevents the impulsive behaviour. The method could combat obesity, substance-abuse disorders, pathological gambling, sexual addiction or intermittent explosive disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by impromptu outbursts of inappropriate anger The implant could prevent drug addicts from injecting heroin, claim scientists\u00a0 Credit: \u00a0Julien Behal PA \u201cImagine if you could predict and prevent a suicide attempt, a heroin injection, a burst of binge eating or alcohol intake, or a sudden bout of uncontrolled rage,\u201d said Dr Casey Halpern, assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. \u201cThere\u2019s no available responsive neurostimulation intervention for dangerous impulsive behavior yet, because until now no one\u2019s been able to document a characteristic signature in the brain that could be used for triggering pulse delivery by the device. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior.\u201d Brain implants are already used to deliver charges to patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease to prevent tremors. But it is the first time it has been shown to work to stop harmful behaviours. In new experiments, the scientists were able to show that the signal existed in a patient with obsessive compulsive disorder, and proved that electrical stimulation in mice stopped binge eating. The research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.","published_at":1513627405,"content_id":"bc3f972d-4907-3395-93e8-8554cbf4ffe2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/brain-implant-could-stop-sex-200000956.html","content_published_at":1513627200,"content_time":1513627200,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-d3ac0518-1475-3a79-8faf-c4dae8640822_a-df272e81-b259-379f-8f4d-959212c5a2d0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/oumuamua-first-alien-object-visit-3zp9gi8","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Independent","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/oumuamua-first-alien-object-visit-160210709.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZyJFiTJEYTrRMRkQOK5OjA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_577\/d9701add24573c3d2b1157b1679c54a8","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V6bpLZFlW6O_O8pJb3LOtA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00OTY7dz03Njg7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_577\/d9701add24573c3d2b1157b1679c54a8","height":496,"width":768,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_577\/d9701add24573c3d2b1157b1679c54a8","imgw":768,"imgh":496,"title":"Oumuamua: First alien object to visit our solar system is wrapped in strange organic coat, scientists reveal","summary":"The first ever interstellar visitor to our solar system is wrapped in a layer of organic insulation, scientists have said.

They're spreading it to other animals, too, including deer, according to a new report. After a video of a snow monkey and sika deer engaging in sexual intercourse went viral, researchers from universities in Canada conducted an experiment, published in\u00a0Archives of Sexual Behavior, to investigate the behavior. \u00a0 To do so, they examined snow monkeys, also known as\u00a0Japanese macaques, in Japan, documenting their attempts to climb on and sexually hump the backs of deer. They compared these actions to sexual interactions between adolescent female monkeys, which is a common occurrence.

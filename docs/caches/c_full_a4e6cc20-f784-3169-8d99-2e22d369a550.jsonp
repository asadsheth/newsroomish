The fire started around 5:53 a.m at 2079 McLaughlin Ave. near Highway 101 and Tully Road and the first engine reportedly arrived within five minutes, said San Jose Fire Capt. Daniel Vega. The fire seems to have started in a second-floor kitchen, he said. Firefighters reported making multiple rescues after arriving on scene before dawn. Vega said that although scared residents tied bedsheets together to prepare to climb down from balconies, \u201cit doesn't seem like that actually happened, as far as we know.","published_at":1523979819,"content_id":"4901466b-d16c-3e32-891e-6f124801f795","content_url":"https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/bayarea\/article\/Massive-apartment-fire-in-San-Jose-requires-12841072.php","content_published_at":1523977560,"content_time":1523977560,"content_relative_time":55,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Local News","vibe_id":"a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":55,"comment_relative_time":55,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931","post_id":"v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-53884158-7700-350a-a60a-96cadbbe5202_a-a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-53884158-7700-350a-a60a-96cadbbe5202_a-a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/san-jose-calif\/v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-53884158-7700-350a-a60a-96cadbbe5202_a-a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931","author":"third_watch","provider":"latimes.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/sports\/ducks\/la-sp-ducks-sharks-elliott-20180416-story.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EOP2Zj_A8FsSGkDhhiLxSA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/28ARP2Ebpfoz.Pitnokazg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931-1803836158.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D7Mexl6SCXnMi5bTp8SDqQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/28ARP2Ebpfoz.Pitnokazg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931-1803836158.jpeg","height":675,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/28ARP2Ebpfoz.Pitnokazg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Njc1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a20a892c-bef6-3aca-bb48-a9fd9f5d8931-1803836158.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":675,"title":"Ducks get obliterated in Game 3 loss in San Jose","summary":"This was as thorough a meltdown as an NHL team can stage in 60 minutes, a complete failure offensively, defensively, in goal and \u2014 as has long been the Ducks' downfall \u2014 in discipline.

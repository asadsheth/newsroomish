But the scientists aboard never made it to their destination: The Amundsen was diverted to rescue unsuspecting ships that had become entrapped by Arctic ice floes that moved into North Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. In past years, these masses of Arctic ice had mostly stayed put in their proper ocean \u2014 the Arctic \u2014 but increasing temperatures caused ice to melt, unclogging the channels connecting the Arctic to the north Atlantic, thus allowing massive surges of ice to flow freely south. \u00a0 SEE ALSO: Gas-filled vessel barrels solo through pathetic Arctic sea ice during dead of winter Scientists aboard the vessel documented the event and published their research in the journal Geophysical Research Letters on March 15, warning that the threat of ice-trapping events could become more commonplace.\u00a0 Icebergs from Greenland's glaciers have long been a hazard for ships in the North Atlantic, particularly during the months of April and May. An iceberg from Greenland's Jakobshavn Glacier is thought to have been responsible for sinking the Titanic in 1912, for example.\u00a0 But now boats are running into trouble because of sea ice getting flushed out of the Arctic.\u00a0 \"The warming in the Arctic and decline in ice cover is increasing the ability of this ice to be transported out of the Arctic, to areas that typically don\u2019t have these large pieces of ice,\" said David Babb, a research scientist at the University of Manitoba's Center for Earth Observation Science, in an interview. Babb is a scientist who was aboard the icebreaker, and is a coauthor of the study. The rescue events for trapped, punctured, and sinking ships specifically occurred in an expanse of ocean north of the large Canadian Island of Newfoundland. Two fishing ships were sunk by the ice, and other ships \u2014 including ferries and an oil tanker \u2014 had to be escorted to ice-free waters by the formidable Amundsen. One fishing vessel could only travel a few hundred meters before getting stuck in the ice, Babb said.\u00a0 To determine where exactly the ice was coming from, scientists on the Amundsen found themselves jumping onto the thick masses of ice in the Atlantic and taking samples of the ice thickness, temperature, and salinity. From their analysis, they found this thicker ice had traveled from the Lincoln Sea in the high Arctic, which is north of Greenland.\u00a0 It's normal for thick masses of multiyear sea ice to travel down the west side of Greenland inside the frigid Nares Strait. Most winters, this ice gets blocked by natural ice dams that form in the narrow channel.\u00a0 But these natural ice dams didn't form in the winter of 2016-2017, allowing the ice to move through. The sizable ice chunks then traveled unhindered through the mostly ice-less Baffin and Labrador seas, eventually collecting around Newfoundland.\u00a0 Scientists collecting ice samples from a large mass of Arctic sea ice that had been transported into the North Atlantic.Image: David G. BarberThe sea ice was further propelled by a third factor: Two early-spring storms whose onshore winds thrust the ice toward Newfoundland.\u00a0 The Arctic sea ice extent in 2017-2018 has been some of the lowest since record-keeping began in 1979. January and February 2018 saw their lowest ice extents on record. And sometime later this century, scientists expect the Arctic to become completely ice-free during the summer months. But this doesn't mean vessels in the future will be safe from surges of ice, both from sea ice and land-based glaciers.\u00a0 Young and relatively thin sea ice will still form in the Arctic during winter, said Babb. This ice, which can be up to two meters (six and a half feet) thick, can bunch together and grow into deformed masses. And it too, explained Babb, might travel swiftly down iceless straits and pose risks to ships in the Atlantic.\u00a0 \"It's the same hazard but it's coming from a different source,\" Babb said. A graph showing this year's Arctic sea ice extent.Image: National snow and ice data centerScientists will once again board the Amundsen this spring, with plans to travel into Hudson Bay. This year, Babb said they've spoken with the Canadian Coast Guard who says there should be other icebreaking vessels in the area, should a surge of thick ice come down again from Arctic and entrap ships. \"We're leaving again to give it another shot,\" he said.

known as Gravitational Lensing. Based on the principles of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, this technique involves relying on a large distribution of matter (such as a galaxy cluster or star) to magnify the light coming from a distant object, thereby making it appear brighter and larger. However, in recent years, astronomers have found other uses for this technique as well. For instance, a team of scientists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) recently determined that Gravitational Lensing could also be used to determine the mass of white dwarf stars.

CMB-S4 will be designed to cross critical thresholds in testing inflation, determining the number and masses of the neutrinos, constraining possible new light relic particles, providing precise constraints on the nature of dark energy, and testing general relativity on large scales. The first goal and requirement for CMB-S4 is to measure the imprint of primordial gravitational waves on the CMB polarization anisotropy, quantified by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r.

Colleagues have revealed the renowned theoretical physicist\u2019s final academic work was to set out the groundbreaking mathematics needed for a spacecraft to find traces of multiple big bangs. Currently being reviewed by a leading scientific journal, the paper, named A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation, may turn out to be Hawking\u2019s most important scientific legacy. The new paper is a bid to clear up an issue thrown up by Hawking's 1983 \"no-boundaries\" theory Credit: Barcroft Images Fellow researchers have said that if the evidence which the new theory promises had been discovered before Hawking died last week, it may have secured the Nobel Prize which had eluded him for so long. The new paper seeks to resolve an issue thrown up by Hawking\u2019s 1983 \u201cno-boundary\u201d theory which described how the universe burst into existence with the big bang. According to that account, the universe instantaneously expanded from a tiny point into a prototype of what we live in today, a process known as inflation. But the theory also predicted an infinite number of big bangs, each creating their own universe, a \u201cmultiverse\u201d, which presented a mathematical paradox because it is seemingly impossible to measure. Read more | Professor Stephen Hawking Carlos Frenk, professor of cosmology at Durham University, told The Sunday Times: The intriguing idea in Hawking\u2019s paper is that [the multiverse] left its imprint on the background radiation permeating our universe and we could measure it with a detector on a spaceship. \u201cThese ideas offer the breathtaking prospect of finding evidence for the existence of other universe.\u201d Professor Thomas Hertog, from KU Leuven University in Belgium, worked with Hawking on the new theory and said he met the Cambridge scientist two weeks ago to discuss its final approval. \u201cThis was Stephen: to boldly go where Star Trek fears to tread,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has often been nominated for the Nobel and should have won it. Now he never can.\u201d In quotes | Stephen Hawking Despite the hopeful promise of Hawking\u2019s final work, it also comes with the depressing prediction that, ultimately, the universe will fade into blackness as stars simply run out of energy. He died last Wednesday in Cambridge at the age of 76, having suffered from a rare form of motor neurone disease since 1964. He eventually became confined to a wheelchair and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication.

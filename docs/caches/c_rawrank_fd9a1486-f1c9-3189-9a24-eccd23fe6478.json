Miami Street is a PC game developed by the UK's Electric Square, but it's not available in all markets yet. Unlike the other popular Microsoft Studios racing franchises -- Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon -- Miami Street doesn't feature realistic racing or a massive open world. Instead, you simply hold down a button (or hold your finger to the touchscreen) to accelerate, and release to brake. Simplicity for every Windows 10 device is key. Here's what Electric Square had to say about Miami Street on its website shortly after the game launched: We\u2019ve got some exciting news to share. We proudly announce Miami Street, a project that Electric Square has been working on with our partners at Microsoft Studios. Developed to be played on any Windows 10 PC device, Miami Street is a new kind of racing game, built for a broad audience who love easy to pick-up-and-play experiences. As we continue the development of Miami Street in the months ahead, we will begin releasing the game in limited regions for testing and player feedback. Other than the blurb on Electric Square's website and the appearance of the game on the Microsoft Store, there don't appear to be any press releases or blog posts from Microsoft regarding the game. The stealth-launch is indeed weird, but Windows Central seems to believe that Miami Street could end up being one of the first games ever released for the upcoming Andromeda OS, which may accompany a new foldable tablet. That said, we won't know anything concrete about why Miami Street exists or where it came from until Microsoft says something about it. In the meantime, you can download the game for free from the Microsoft Store right now.","published_at":1527564917,"content_id":"b4305143-237d-34d1-a04b-33ee39972ceb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/miami-street-brand-free-play-racing-game-microsoft-033454699.html","content_published_at":1527564894,"content_time":1527564894,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":16,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"bb681680-a43c-3bdd-af66-33b64c5aebf1","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-6f869ebd-97cc-3028-8029-73fb210f238b_a-bb681680-a43c-3bdd-af66-33b64c5aebf1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-6f869ebd-97cc-3028-8029-73fb210f238b_a-bb681680-a43c-3bdd-af66-33b64c5aebf1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/fortnite-news-shopping-carts-4-1f1jkgx","author":"nanook","provider":"Express.co.uk","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/entertainment\/gaming\/966245\/Fortnite-Shopping-Carts-Update-4-3-Week-5-Challenges","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ws.dYrHNxVWXLTd6O7I_vQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aTNglcv6OtuRIKmnbGl6Og--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bb681680-a43c-3bdd-af66-33b64c5aebf1--688427837.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/m_inFQCT9QYNH.l.D5iUvg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NDU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aTNglcv6OtuRIKmnbGl6Og--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bb681680-a43c-3bdd-af66-33b64c5aebf1--688427837.jpeg","height":445,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aTNglcv6OtuRIKmnbGl6Og--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bb681680-a43c-3bdd-af66-33b64c5aebf1--688427837.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":445,"title":"Fortnite news: Shopping Carts, Update 4.3 and Week 5 Challenges","summary":"EPIC GAMES Fortnite news this week includes Shopping Carts and Week 5 Challenges Later today will see Epic Games release their next round of Challenges and new content.

Four crosses in front of the building serve as a memorial to the lives lost.

When Epic Games released Fortnite last year, the title had mostly positive reviews, but it wasn't until the free-to-play battle royale was introduced several months later that the game really took off. The surge in popularity of the battle royale genre has created an opportunity for investors to benefit from the craze. Here's why I believe NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tencent Holdings (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY), and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are best positioned to profit from this growing trend.","published_at":1527436486,"content_id":"a43dbfa3-a345-31f6-b7d1-13854c961a2f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2018\/05\/27\/3-stocks-cashing-in-on-fortnite-fever.aspx","content_published_at":1527435900,"content_time":1527435900,"content_relative_time":52,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":52,"comment_relative_time":52,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"68a86993-49d6-3720-a375-b1d9fe644045","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d88a239d-159d-3003-a131-d293fce5b7d0_a-68a86993-49d6-3720-a375-b1d9fe644045","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d88a239d-159d-3003-a131-d293fce5b7d0_a-68a86993-49d6-3720-a375-b1d9fe644045","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/destiny-2s-excellent-exotic-rework-1kmsj7h","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/insertcoin\/2018\/05\/27\/destiny-2s-excellent-exotic-rework-has-changed-the-game-from-top-to-bottom\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7btCXea7lRN7cqqQKkHqsQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wtN370pE4TvFz8iwMg4lbg--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_68a86993-49d6-3720-a375-b1d9fe644045--1224132699.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6FpSE3pcAu3beS1IriGpXg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzQ7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wtN370pE4TvFz8iwMg4lbg--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_68a86993-49d6-3720-a375-b1d9fe644045--1224132699.jpeg","height":434,"width":640,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wtN370pE4TvFz8iwMg4lbg--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_68a86993-49d6-3720-a375-b1d9fe644045--1224132699.jpeg","imgw":640,"imgh":434,"title":"Destiny 2's Excellent Exotic Rework Has Changed The Game From Top To Bottom","summary":"I've been accused of being rather salty about Destiny recently, and to that I say, what else is new?

I am shirking my remaining move-in duties (much to the dismay of my wife) to run away and play Destiny's Warmind expansion as much as possible. That's how much fun I've been having with it (minus Escalation Protocol grouping headaches). But what I've found is that the most fun part of Warmind is\u2026really nothing that has anything to do with Warmind at all, and something all players, even those that don't own the DLC, have access to.

Considering the previous news that the game will be getting a proper release date next month, it's clear that Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally going to come out. It's been a long road for the game though, with concepts for it starting back as early as 2006. However, the big reveal happened back in 2013, so we have been waiting five years for this game.

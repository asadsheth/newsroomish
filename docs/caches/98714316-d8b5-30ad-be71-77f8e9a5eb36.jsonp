Interest in Bitcoin rocketed last year after the value of the currency surged from under $1,000 (\u00a3709) at the start of 2017 to almost\u00a0$20,000 (\u00a314,180) in December, with\u00a0IG Group recording\u00a012,500\u00a0clients\u00a0who traded for the first time during the\u00a0period.\u00a0 However\u00a0the frenzy is already dwindling after investors were spooked by the currency's recent drops in value, with IG Group noting that cryptocurrency trading has \"slowed markedly\" since the end of January. Bitcoin this evening was trading at\u00a0$8,601, 56pc less than its peak.\u00a0 While investors have been concerned about\u00a0a global crackdown on digital currencies,\u00a0few have been put off by the clampdown on the\u00a0spreadbetting industry.

Interest in Bitcoin rocketed last year after the value of the currency surged from under $1,000 (\u00a3709) at the start of 2017 to almost\u00a0$20,000 (\u00a314,180) in December, with\u00a0IG Group recording\u00a012,500\u00a0clients\u00a0who traded for the first time during the\u00a0period.\u00a0 However\u00a0the frenzy is already dwindling after investors were spooked by the currency's recent drops in value, with IG Group noting that cryptocurrency trading has \"slowed markedly\" since the end of January. Bitcoin this evening was trading at\u00a0$8,601, 56pc less than its peak.\u00a0 While investors have been concerned about\u00a0a global crackdown on digital currencies,\u00a0few have been put off by the clampdown on the\u00a0spreadbetting industry. The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) is due to\u00a0publish a swathe of strict measures for the sector with the aim of protecting inexperienced investors.\u00a0 The company said that while any impact from the new rules are\u00a0unlikely to be felt in 2018 \"it remains difficult to predict what impact regulatory change may have on the business in subsequent financial years\". \u00a0 The\u00a0UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) sent a damning letter to industry bosses earlier this year after uncovering \"areas of serious concern\" in the sector following a year-long review. The\u00a0majority of retail investors (76pc) lost money on so-called contracts for difference trades\u00a0between July 2015 and\u00a0June 2016, the FCA said. \u00a0","published_at":1521725570,"content_id":"eb8b1d32-c25e-3288-8ca9-8e8f26bfefce","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/ig-group-boosted-punters-piling-172128525.html","content_published_at":1521739288,"content_time":1521739288,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-287e7b43-132d-3de8-bca4-bae730ee8e64_a-c4b48679-1ab7-357c-9fcc-9887c018cc81","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-287e7b43-132d-3de8-bca4-bae730ee8e64_a-c4b48679-1ab7-357c-9fcc-9887c018cc81","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Bloomberg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-03-22\/cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-is-said-to-face-warning-in-japan?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/u2Q3Kg8XOOeq63L50vzqNQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/333925721353a62e7bdf13aed06ea167","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SmgeAC6dEeBG3k.SftWZ1Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/333925721353a62e7bdf13aed06ea167","height":800,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/333925721353a62e7bdf13aed06ea167","imgw":1200,"imgh":800,"title":"One of the World\u2019s Biggest Crypto Exchanges Is Facing Regulatory Trouble","summary":"Japan\u2019s securities regulator is planning to warn Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to stop operating in the country without a license, a person familiar with the matter said....","published_at":1521724821,"content_id":"c4b48679-1ab7-357c-9fcc-9887c018cc81","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-03-22\/cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-is-said-to-face-warning-in-japan?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1521713593,"content_time":1521713593,"content_relative_time":33,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-9bd2d3eb-fc31-367a-9764-f1cf2c815f45_a-9531ad3e-c5f0-3624-8d2c-d30c80203601","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-9bd2d3eb-fc31-367a-9764-f1cf2c815f45_a-9531ad3e-c5f0-3624-8d2c-d30c80203601","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Fortune","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/night-1-million-crypto-began-182545124.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PjHSsLtqNFnu_rYGiHI43A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fortune_175\/47716467e5fb81edd079d79e5090adca","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l4l4zoFJFjLARgGydT0xKQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fortune_175\/47716467e5fb81edd079d79e5090adca","height":768,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fortune_175\/47716467e5fb81edd079d79e5090adca","imgw":1024,"imgh":768,"title":"The Night $1 Million in Crypto Began Raining From the Sky","summary":"Free \"airdrop\" tokens offer a way to skirt the SEC's ICO crackdown.","published_at":1521717566,"content_id":"9531ad3e-c5f0-3624-8d2c-d30c80203601","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/night-1-million-crypto-began-182545124.html","content_published_at":1521656745,"content_time":1521656745,"content_relative_time":49,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

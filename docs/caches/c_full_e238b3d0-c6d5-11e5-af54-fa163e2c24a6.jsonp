The roster still has expensive veterans like Harrison Barnes and Wesley Matthews. Dirk Nowitzki is going to return for his 21st season. These are players that probably won't want to sit around and wait for a rebuild. Apparently, neither does the Mavericks organization. Despite only winning 24 games last season, Dallas is reportedly going to swing for the fences in free agency and try to grab a talented big man. According to\u00a0Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer, the Mavericks want to be back to winning sooner rather than later.","published_at":1526971276,"content_id":"a0db77e7-20ad-3a00-a5ce-7f214c3cd274","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cbssports.com\/nba\/news\/nba-free-agency-rumors-mavericks-targeting-expensive-bigs-like-demarcus-cousins-deandre-jordan-or-julius-randle\/","content_published_at":1526963159,"content_time":1526963159,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":13,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8bdb8f48-bd14-326a-bc2b-4e4a93650424","post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-9da6c4f5-1746-36d0-815c-d2ea52d8e38d_a-8bdb8f48-bd14-326a-bc2b-4e4a93650424","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-9da6c4f5-1746-36d0-815c-d2ea52d8e38d_a-8bdb8f48-bd14-326a-bc2b-4e4a93650424","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/quinn-cook-learned-hard-way-30u004j","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Mercury News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/05\/21\/quinn-cook-learned-the-hard-way-not-to-take-a-single-minute-for-granted-in-the-nba\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cOkZWLMUXSWGZVIp3oCYzg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpKKSH4dOsH3cQUTqqIuHw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9ODE2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8bdb8f48-bd14-326a-bc2b-4e4a93650424-1343729908.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7L8It6MjbhAaCQKlaAVooA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MTY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpKKSH4dOsH3cQUTqqIuHw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9ODE2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8bdb8f48-bd14-326a-bc2b-4e4a93650424-1343729908.jpeg","height":816,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpKKSH4dOsH3cQUTqqIuHw--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9ODE2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8bdb8f48-bd14-326a-bc2b-4e4a93650424-1343729908.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":816,"title":"Quinn Cook learned the hard way not to take a single minute for granted in the NBA","summary":"OAKLAND \u2014 Quinn Cook has a nagging regret from three years ago.

Stevens Has Simple Message For Celtics After Game 4 Loss To Cavs","summary":"Brad Stevens isn't one for long-winded monologues. After the Boston Celtics dropped Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals 111-102 to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night, Boston now finds the series tied at two heading back to TD Garden for a crucial Game 5. But Stevens didn't feel like his young team needed a big pep talk after their Game 4 loss. Instead, the head coach gave his squad a simple message. Well said. Boston's young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown echoed Stevens' message after the loss as well. The Celtics now are 1-6 on the road in the playoffs, but will head back to TD Garden for Game 5 where they will need to find a way to slow down LeBron James.

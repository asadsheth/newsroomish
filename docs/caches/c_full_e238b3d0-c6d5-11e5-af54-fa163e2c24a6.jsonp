His scoring might always be inconsistent. But one thing Justise Winslow can control each night is his effort on the defensive end of the floor. On Monday, particularly in the Miami Heat's blitzkrieg second quarter, Winslow was the best defensive player on the court. His physical, full-court man-to-man might have single-handedly gotten Philadelphia 76ers point guard Ben Simmons off his game. And as a result, the Heat head home with a split, and the series' tone changed. Even though Simmons finished with a respectable stat line Monday \u2014 24 points on 10 of 17 shooting, nine rebounds and eight assists \u2014 the Heat won the game with a 34-13 drubbing in the second

Embiid is 'f*cking sick and tired of being babied' after sitting out 76ers' Game 2 loss","summary":"The Philadelphia 76ers lost Game 2 of their first-round series against the Miami Heat on Monday night, thanks largely to Dwyane Wade turning back the clock and scoring 28 points. Of course, if the Sixers had star center Joel Embiid on the floor, they may have been able to still find a way to win despite Wade's tremendous performance. Embiid hasn't played since March 28 after suffering an orbital fracture, and still hasn't been medically cleared to play (though he's cleared the concussion protocol). Well, after Monday night's loss, Embiid took to social media to show his frustration about not being out there to help his teammates.

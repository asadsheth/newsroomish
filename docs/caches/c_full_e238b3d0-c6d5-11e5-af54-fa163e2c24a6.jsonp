But while the Celtics fight for an NBA championship, Irving is battling in his own right. Irving was deemed out for the remainder of the season due to a lingering knee issue, which has required two procedures within the past month. While the 26-year-old is less than two weeks removed from his latest surgery, he apparently already has made great strides in his recovery. Boston fans got a glimpse of this Sunday afternoon during its Game 1 win over the Milwaukee Bucks in their first-round series. Irving was present at TD Garden for the game, where he wasn't seen with crutches nor a noticeable limp.

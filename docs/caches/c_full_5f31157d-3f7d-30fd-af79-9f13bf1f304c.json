Editorial: The LDS Church should revise the 'bishop's interview'","summary":"In light of the recent social media #MeToo campaign, which has brought to light the deplorable pervasiveness of sexual harassment and abuse, some are questioning common practices that may cross similar, inappropriate lines. It turns out, it is not appropriate for adolescent and teen youth to sit in a room with a male ecclesiastical leader with the door closed and be expected to answer questions about sexual history, inclinations or desires. The consensus is that the practice of Mormon bishops \u201cinterviewing\u201d adolescents about their sexual history as part of the repentance process is both unnecessary and fraught with danger. It places adolescents in uncomfortable situations where they feel obligated to talk about sensitive issues with non-family members.","published_at":1513607796,"content_id":"2a9075b8-1db7-30ca-975e-c3f7eee13664","content_url":"http:\/\/www.sltrib.com\/opinion\/editorial\/2017\/12\/18\/tribune-editorial-the-lds-church-should-revise-the-bishops-interview\/","content_published_at":1513584000,"content_time":1513584000,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society

She had been out in the lively Gemmayzeh neighbourhood of Beirut for the farewell party of a colleague at the British embassy and had left just before midnight with a friend.\u00a0 The\u00a0two then parted ways, leaving Miss Dykes to either walk or take a taxi to her home five minutes away.\u00a0 She had not been drinking as she had an early flight to catch home early the next morning for the Christmas holidays.\u00a0 She was abducted some time after and killed. Her body was found dumped on the Metn highway several miles away.\u00a0 Police sources told the Telegraph the first autopsy revealed the cause of death as strangulation, however a second postmortem examination is to be carried out later.\u00a0 They said they did not believe the attack to be politically motivated. One friend told the Telegraph: \"It's horrific. We had no idea what happened to her until we got a call today to go to the police station to give statements.\" Miss Dykes had been working in Beirut as the programme and policy manager for the Department for International Development since January 2017.

In a statement her family said: \"We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Rebecca. We are doing all we can to understand what happened.\" Hugo Shorter, the British ambassador to Lebanon, said: \"The whole embassy is deeply shocked, saddened by this news. My thoughts are with Becky\u2019s family, friends and colleagues for their tragic loss.\u00a0 \"We're providing consular support to her family and working very closely with Lebanese authorities who are conducting police investigation.\" A spokesman for the Department for International Development where she worked said: \"Our thoughts are with Becky's family and friends at this very upsetting time. \"There is now a police investigation and the FCO (Foreign Office) is providing consular support to Becky's family and working with the local authorities.\" Such incidents are rare in Beirut, despite the fragile security situation in the country. Since the end of the country's 15-year civil war in 1990, Lebanon has become more stable.\u00a0 It saw record numbers of tourists this year and attracts increasing numbers of holidaymakers looking to enjoy its Mediterranean beaches and hot climate.\u00a0","published_at":1513529531,"content_id":"7d21ec2c-f611-3fbc-845e-b70af71cf569","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/british-diplomat-found-dead-lebanon-170525954.html","content_published_at":1513530325,"content_time":1513530325,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c186e5cb-f232-3632-829c-548053390746","post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-2bc46fbc-f2a5-3073-9355-347fa1609c38_a-c186e5cb-f232-3632-829c-548053390746","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-2bc46fbc-f2a5-3073-9355-347fa1609c38_a-c186e5cb-f232-3632-829c-548053390746","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/woman-arrested-florida-police-found-att5a6c","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Independent","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/woman-arrested-florida-police-found-151100463.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/VsLpFsahhlbG9BvunWo1_w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/ac90bdef705014597eca9fcae9ab35c5","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mXRXpO12TXT0uDEGplvqlA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzI7dz03Njg7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/ac90bdef705014597eca9fcae9ab35c5","height":432,"width":768,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/ac90bdef705014597eca9fcae9ab35c5","imgw":768,"imgh":432,"title":"Woman arrested in Florida after police found three dead dogs in her freezer","summary":"A woman has been arrested in Florida after authorities found three dead dogs in her freezer.

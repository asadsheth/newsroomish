rookie Sterling Brown, who is black, and Joseph J. Grams, a white police officer. When Brown - the son of a police officer - asked the officer why he was being aggressively confronted over a minor parking violation, Grams responded, \"I'll do what I want. I own this right here.\" To which Brown replied: \"You don't own me, though.\" What happened next is a scenario that black Milwaukeeans \u2013 and other black Americans \u2013 know all too well.

Pius Masai Mwachi of the National Disaster Management Unit says a rescue operation is going on after a five-story residential building collapsed early Sunday in Nairobi's Huruma Ngei neighborhood. He said a body was pulled from the rubble and another person who was rescued alive later died. He said three others rescued are being treated at a hospital. Building collapses have become common in Nairobi, where 4 million people live in low-income areas or slums.

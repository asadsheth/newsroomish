Mark Conditt died in the early hours of Wednesday when a SWAT team closed in on his vehicle near Round Rock, 20 miles from Austin. \u00a0Police said that they had learnt of his identity in the previous 24 hours, when he had dropped off a package at a FedEx in Austin and was caught on CCTV. They then obtained his Google search records, and found suspicious activity. Conditt lived in the Pflugerville suburb of Austin - close to the home of his parents. He had three younger sisters, and all were predominately home-schooled by their mother,\u00a0Danene Conditt. As part of his studies he appears to have written a blog, with six postings discussing social and political issues between January and May 2012. Introducing himself, he wrote:\u00a0\"I enjoy cycling, parkour, tennis, reading, and listening to music. \"I am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended. \"The reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\" His postings show him to be of moderate conservative leanings - against gay marriage and abortion, and in favour of the death penalty. Mrs Conditt\u00a0posted a photo her son in February 2013 on Facebook, saying: \"I officially graduated Mark from High School on Friday. 1 down, 3 to go. He has 30 hrs of college credit too, but he's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do....maybe a mission trip. Thanks to everyone for your support over the years.\" After completing his studies Conditt worked at Crux Semiconductor Manufacturing in Austin, and had been previously employed as a computer repair technician. His work at Crux will certainly come under the scrutiny of police, as they try to piece together how he obtained the bomb-making equipment. TMZ reported that at Crux his role was\u00a0\"purchasing agent\/buyer\/shipping and receiving\" for the company, which is involved in robotics, mechanical repair and metal products. Candy Buchleitner has lived near the family for five years, keeping chickens in her backyard. She told The Telegraph that the neighborhood is normally very quiet, and home to mostly older people. It backs up to about 20 acres of undeveloped land.\u00a0 She did not know the family of the suspected bomber but said she was sad to hear they are grieving. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy all around,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThey lost a son and now everybody is on top of

Ralph Peters, a retired Lt. Col. for the army and until recently a Fox News strategic analyst, decided to leave his post at the station after finally having a moment of clarity.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: What the hell is up with those bizarre Fox News Apple alerts? Peters' departure was first reported by BuzzFeed News, which obtained a copy of an email announcing his departure and detailing his reasoning to his colleagues.\u00a0 \"Today, I feel that Fox News is assaulting our constitutional order and the rule of law, while fostering corrosive and unjustified paranoia among viewers,\" Peters wrote in the email. \"Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association. Now I am ashamed.\" Peters continued by saying he thought that Fox News \"degenerated from providing a legitimate and much-needed outlet for conservative voices to a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically ruinous administration.\" Hard to believe it took him this long to realize it, but be assured he hasn't had a total change of heart. Peters, who was briefly suspended from the network \u00a0several years ago for calling then President Obama a \"total pussy\" on live TV over his terrorism strategy, used his goodbye letter to take a dig at him one last time while simultaneously bashing Trump and Fox News' hosts. \"As a Russia analyst for many years, it also has appalled me that hosts who made their reputations as super-patriots and who, justifiably, savaged President Obama for his duplicitous folly with Putin, now advance Putin's agenda by making light of Russian penetration of our elections and the Trump campaign,\" Peters wrote.\u00a0 Fox News wasn't just going to let Peters trash talk the network, however, saying he was using his opinion \"as a weapon in order to gain attention.\" NEW - Statement from Fox News on Ralph Peters email: \"Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention.

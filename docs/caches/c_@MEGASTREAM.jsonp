Almost Attacked Russians in Syria Again but Moscow Stepped in, Mattis Says","summary":"Defense Secretary James Mattis revealed Tuesday that U.S. forces nearly bombed Russians fighting on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sometime in the past week, but a call with Moscow's own armed forces defused the situation. Following an incident last month, in which the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS killed a large number of these pro-Assad fighters, including Russians, Mattis said another\u00a0clash was recently avoided after Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, contacted Russia's top military leader, Army General Valery Gerasimov, via a deconfliction hotline. \"There were other Russian elements like this moving across the deconfliction line, which is the river, as you know, into an area that we'd agreed with the Russians they could operate in, as they had allowed us to operate basically to the west of the river, up at Tabqa and around Raqqa.\u00a0 We'd agreed for them being slightly east of the river at Deir Ezzor,\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.","published_at":1522265375,"content_id":"d0ee304b-32d4-35d0-826b-0181602596ab","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/u-almost-attacked-russians-syria-192935006.html","content_published_at":1522265375,"content_time":1522265375,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":138,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":3,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8d68e929-dbb4-3182-a9e6-cba1e8107f72","post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-8d68e929-dbb4-3182-a9e6-cba1e8107f72_a-8d68e929-dbb4-3182-a9e6-cba1e8107f72","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

say they\u2019ve discovered a new human organ, and it might be the biggest","summary":"Of all the countless subjects of scientific research that have ever existed, you'd have to think the human body would be the most well-understood. We're still tackling plenty of pesky diseases and ailments but the overall makeup of our bodies must be pretty well understood at this point, right? Not so, according to new research that suggests mankind has completely overlooked an entire human organ, and it could be the largest of all. A lengthy new study published in Scientific Reports describes what is called the interstitium. It's the name being given to the many tiny, fluid-filled gaps within human tissue that blanket the entire human body. These tiny spaces and the fluid that fills them aren't new to science, but this new work argues that we may be drastically underestimating its importance, and the role it plays in human anatomy may be dramatic enough to warrant its labeling as an organ. Every youngster is taught in school that the largest human organ doesn't exist within the body but around it \u2014 the skin. The interstitium present in each human may in fact be larger overall than our skin itself, and if the scientific community embraces its labeling as an organ it may be the new king. \"Initially, we were just thinking it's an interesting tissue, but when you actually delve into how people define organs, it sort of runs around one or two ideas: that it has a unitary structure or that it's a tissue with a unitary structure, or it's a tissue with a unitary function,\" Dr. Neil Theise of NYU Langone Health, co-senior author of the work, told CNN. \"This has both. This structure is the same wherever you look at it, and so are the functions that we're starting to elucidate.\" But what makes this seemingly simple tissue so important? The scientists believe that it may play a crucial part in how diseases spread around the body, including many cancers. Past researcher has already revealed that the tissue can promote the spread of cancers outside of the organs in which they originated, suggested that a better understanding of how the interstitium works could help doctors create new treatment plans to mitigate the damage cancers cause. If the interstitium is indeed an active part of our anatomy it's obviously been dramatically overlooked by scientists in the past. Moving forward, this new work will form a base of knowledge for doctors and researchers to investigate how this newfound \"organ\" could be used in the treatment and prevention of diseases.","published_at":1522242091,"content_id":"b9e97738-7d78-3f9b-a824-390d8f5bb04f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/scientists-ve-discovered-human-organ-might-biggest-130131446.html","content_published_at":1522242091,"content_time":1522242091,"content_relative_time":9,"reaction_count":357,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":9,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7","post_id":"v-e1c174aa-5e87-3632-a4cb-2acfa5bf303e_c-79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7_a-79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e1c174aa-5e87-3632-a4cb-2acfa5bf303e_c-79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7_a-79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/gun-violence\/v-e1c174aa-5e87-3632-a4cb-2acfa5bf303e_c-79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7_a-79762c65-1ef3-39f6-b6f8-cc7620037ab7","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"The Wrap","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/cnn-student-gun-violence-panel-goes-off-rails-153525837.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/u4Y6fXlLa6750DgSIhpcEA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/CNN_Student_Gun_Violence_Panel-19a9d6d12cdf4539377d248d5182683a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NRiSujIKn4VIPazm_5y8mw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MTI7dz02MTg7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/CNN_Student_Gun_Violence_Panel-19a9d6d12cdf4539377d248d5182683a","height":412,"width":618,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/CNN_Student_Gun_Violence_Panel-19a9d6d12cdf4539377d248d5182683a","imgw":618,"imgh":412,"title":"CNN Student Gun Violence Panel Goes Off the Rails: \u2018You\u2019re a Racist!\u2019 (Video)","summary":"CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d welcomed a panel of high school students to discuss school gun violence.

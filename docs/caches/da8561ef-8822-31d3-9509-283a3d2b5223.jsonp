But if you don't have access to a 401(k) plan or it isn't meeting all of your investment needs, you may want to diversify your savings. The good news is there are quite a few ways to save money for retirement without completely relying on a 401(k) plan. Consider these alternative ways to save for retirement: 1. Traditional IRA. A 401(k) isn't the only type of retirement savings account. A traditional individual retirement account also allows you to save pre-tax dollars, and you don't pay taxes on your contributions until you withdraw the money from the account.

The National Audit Office said the rule changes made to last year\u2019s auction for contracts to support new, low-carbon power projects mean that energy users will be on the hook for an extra \u00a3100m a year. Over the fifteen year life-span of the contracts, which guarantee the project\u2019s earnings through top-up payments, costs will spiral \u00a31.5bn higher than might otherwise have been the case without the Government\u2019s tinkering. The reverse auction was initially lauded as a major success for Government after prices steadily fell to new lows, and eventually awarded 11 contracts to projects capable of powering 3.6 million homes. The falling costs were largely driven by offshore wind developers which have dramatically cut the cost of their mega-turbines in recent years. Prices could have fallen lower if not for a cap on the capacity available to small-scale projects which burn biomass or waste to generate power. The NAO said this might have squeezed out cheaper projects which were too large to fit within the cap. The UK's new investment in clean energy ($) Credit: Bloomberg New Energy Finance The Government\u2019s spending watchdog scolded the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for changing the limits on which technologies could take part in the auction without thoroughly testing the impact. \u201cThe Department did not highlight the change to its programme management board or test whether it was likely to lead to unintended consequences,\u201d the NAO report said. \u201cIn some situations, the design change could have produced better value for money for consumers, but the Department did not assess how likely these were to occur in practice\u201d. The unnecessary cost hike has emerged alongside a fresh report from MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee which warned that the UK\u2019s green investment has plummeted to its lowest level in ten years, in a \u201cdramatic and worrying collapse\u201d for the energy industry. The report revealed that investment in clean energy fell by 10pc in 2016 and 56pc in 2017, to its lowest level since 2008. \u201cBillions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets,\u201d said Mary Creagh, the committee\u2019s chair. \u201cThe Government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the investment required to meet the UK\u2019s climate change targets.\u201d Specifically the committee has called on Government to provide greater clarity on how it intends to deliver the Clean Growth Strategy by the 2018 Budget, and explore the potential of Sovereign Green Bonds.","published_at":1526425520,"content_id":"86cbcdd7-aa7f-34ca-ba77-4c5918911e7e","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/government-green-subsidy-tinkering-cost-230100226.html","content_published_at":1526425260,"content_time":1526425260,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-cefa6f43-253b-3b0e-b54f-fa0f13404f88_a-86ae22fd-ce2b-3784-a3a3-4a428688173c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/latest-court-vacates-key-atlantic-4jdun33","author":"nanook","provider":"Associated Press","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.ap.org\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/04\/21\/image001-png_162613.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/latest-court-vacates-key-atlantic-003218551.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Latest: Pipeline spokeswoman: Work can go on despite ruling","summary":"RICHMOND, Va.

Christiana Figueres, formerly head of the U.N.

The former Costa Rican diplomat who campaigns for a peak in global emissions by 2020 said it made no economic sense to explore in the Arctic, partly because it was likely to take years to develop any finds.","published_at":1526364371,"content_id":"e0829f64-41eb-397a-9fe3-16d6e6ca0a62","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/arctic-oil-undrillable-amid-global-warming-u-n-060459953.html","content_published_at":1526364299,"content_time":1526364299,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-dadf0f18-660b-33f5-8028-fef8fd2603b8_a-8cbe1885-f776-3458-a770-959762508d32","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/no-time-waste-moscow-urged-recycle-not-burn-2mfmp93","author":"third_watch","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/no-time-waste-moscow-urged-recycle-not-burn-031517603.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ta.2jf73fAivYFNm74nYzg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/Part-DV-DV1419800-1-1-0.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ThWkiJN35PyTzaeogrCj_g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODE7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/Part-DV-DV1419800-1-1-0.jpg","height":681,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/Part-DV-DV1419800-1-1-0.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":681,"title":"No time to waste: Moscow urged to recycle, not burn","summary":"Protests have been growing in recent months over the stench from landfill sites around Moscow, overflowing with millions of tonnes of rubbish.

The Latest on an earthquake that rattled the San Francisco Bay Area (all times local): 10:05 p.m. A small earthquake that rattled the San Francisco Bay Area didn't cause any major damage or injuries but it did delay commuter trains and a baseball game. The U.S. Geological Survey says a 3.5-magnitude temblor struck two miles (3 kilometers) northeast of Oakland at 7:18 p.m. Monday. Bay Area Rapid Transit says tracks were inspected after the quake, which caused a 10-minute systemwide delay. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that the quake briefly interrupted the San Francisco Giants game.

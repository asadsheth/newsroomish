The release of the Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, marks the first reported instance of the EPA issuing tradable credits from previous years into the present market. It is likely to add fuel to an already fiery dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over the future of America's biofuel policy by opening the door to similar challenges from other refiners in the future.","published_at":1527764963,"content_id":"d149d0be-df81-3649-9aa8-5325f9a623d0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-u-epa-grants-refiners-biofuel-credits-remedy-110651852--finance.html","content_published_at":1527790874,"content_time":1527790874,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":4,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-766ab287-ba3e-36e0-a064-640722e55f8a_a-3d4df336-a5cc-34a3-a9d0-6d1569558556","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/lake-st-clair-worse-e-1x05de8","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Detroit Free Press","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.freep.com\/story\/news\/local\/michigan\/2018\/05\/31\/lake-st-clair-e-coli-lake-erie\/656893002\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3A0Y2R1RzyVK9i_KENRSjA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2m4B.CTmdvXHw__lEIpbTQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3d4df336-a5cc-34a3-a9d0-6d1569558556-1488763756.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Lo.jFkMcIUTETkBfvAENiQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2m4B.CTmdvXHw__lEIpbTQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3d4df336-a5cc-34a3-a9d0-6d1569558556-1488763756.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2m4B.CTmdvXHw__lEIpbTQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3d4df336-a5cc-34a3-a9d0-6d1569558556-1488763756.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"Lake St. Clair has worse E. coli pollution than Lake Erie, study finds","summary":"Lake St. Clair has worse E. coli bacterial contamination than Lake Erie.

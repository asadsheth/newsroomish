Called \"Medicare Extra for All,\" the proposal Thursday from the Center for American Progress, or CAP, would provide a path toward universal health care coverage. But in a nod to political pragmatism, the plan would preserve roles for employer coverage and for the health insurance industry. Employers and individuals would have a choice of joining Medicare Extra, but it would not be required. That differs from the more traditional \"single-payer\" approach advocated by Vermont independent Sen.

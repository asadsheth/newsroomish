Fifty percent believe it has been mostly a failure, and 44 percent say it has been mostly a success. A Christian college in northwest Iowa has won its legal fight against an Obamacare requirement that employers pay for all forms of birth control for their workers. A federal judge ruled this week that requiring Dordt College to pay for certain types of contraception would violate the college's religious beliefs. The ruling from Judge Mark Bennett granted a permanent injunction, which confirmed a temporary injunction he ordered in the case in 2014.

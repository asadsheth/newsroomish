Republicans were planning to change their proposal to drop the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent. The moves were calculated to deliver Republicans a majority of votes in the House and Senate as lawmakers proceed on an ambitious plan to produce a final tax bill this week and pass it by early next, sending it to President Trump for his signature by Christmas.","published_at":1513097716,"content_id":"a816305e-39f6-3937-a8a9-b8235498da8f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/business\/wp\/2017\/12\/12\/congress-could-finalize-deal-to-reconcile-house-and-senate-tax-bills-as-soon-as-today-top-republican-says\/","content_published_at":1513073760,"content_time":1513073760,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-d94b43c6-d784-3dad-9318-64a64d11ced8_a-8e5106ca-a694-302f-bed2-0eb4cdd5596e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/cardiac-arrhythmia-monitoring-devices-market-93nf65j","author":"third_watch","provider":"PR Newswire","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/cardiac-arrhythmia-monitoring-devices-market-113000201.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Cardiac Arrhythmia Monitoring Devices Market to Reach US$ 8,517.1 Mn by 2025 -Persistence Market Research","summary":"Cardiac Arrhythmia Monitoring Devices Market Revenue to Soar Across the North America Regional Market in the Near Future NEW YORK , December 12, 2017 \/PRNewswire\/ -- According to the latest market report ...","published_at":1513071210,"content_id":"8e5106ca-a694-302f-bed2-0eb4cdd5596e","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/cardiac-arrhythmia-monitoring-devices-market-113000201.html","content_published_at":1513078200,"content_time":1513078200,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3a0d567-3b5f-309e-8e3c-d5f2f67d0db5_a-805a2233-2f5f-3999-a81f-59612e9a7bee","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3a0d567-3b5f-309e-8e3c-d5f2f67d0db5_a-805a2233-2f5f-3999-a81f-59612e9a7bee","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/12\/11\/tax-reform-and-health-policy-should-be-linked-just-not-via-the-individual-mandate.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cheadline%7Cstory&par=yahoo&doc=104888658&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ysXZrIHxYeBJLjyXJEMicQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8KLTMfzmj29KJxbTjqzziQ--\/dz0xOTEwO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_805a2233-2f5f-3999-a81f-59612e9a7bee-967738022.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IKMlL.TnHOMTXmIPJWocpg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTkxMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8KLTMfzmj29KJxbTjqzziQ--\/dz0xOTEwO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_805a2233-2f5f-3999-a81f-59612e9a7bee-967738022.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1910,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8KLTMfzmj29KJxbTjqzziQ--\/dz0xOTEwO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_805a2233-2f5f-3999-a81f-59612e9a7bee-967738022.jpeg","imgw":1910,"imgh":1000,"title":"Tax reform and health policy should be linked \u2014 just not via the individual mandate","summary":"Erik McGregor | Pacific Press | LightRocket | Getty Images As Republicans come to grips with the ramifications of their tax legislation, it is becoming clear that any hope of a revenue-neutral and conservative tax reform is fading.

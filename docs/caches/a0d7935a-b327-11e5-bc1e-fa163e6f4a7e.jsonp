So legislators have created a policy work-around that doles out some extra money with direction to the state healthy agency to keep that coverage waiting for people when they get free. The waylaid bill would let people sent to prison or mental health facilities press pause on their benefits and then pick them up again when they're released. Under current law, Medicaid recipients need to reapply for benefits. That can take weeks or months, effectively delaying care and jeopardizing the finances of the poor.

According to the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights' survey of 415 North Korean defectors living in the South, 22.9 percent said they have wanted to go back to North Korea, mostly because of families they left in the North. The poll was conducted with NK Social Research, a survey agency specializing in North Korean defectors, between Nov. 21 and Dec. 5 over telephone. Longing for reunion with families back in the North was the most frequent reason for having wanted to return, cited by 34.3 percent of those who answered in the affirmative, according to the survey.","published_at":1517453176,"content_id":"165235b3-ba35-308d-aa66-c7d99e8b7904","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/World-News\/2018\/01\/31\/Survey-20-of-North-Korean-defectors-have-considered-returning\/1751517420496\/","content_published_at":1517422063,"content_time":1517422063,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e88ddc81-4417-3fd0-917d-25792fa074cc","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3f6f199-cd4e-3796-8971-a421c7ac2ede_a-e88ddc81-4417-3fd0-917d-25792fa074cc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3f6f199-cd4e-3796-8971-a421c7ac2ede_a-e88ddc81-4417-3fd0-917d-25792fa074cc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/u-general-says-north-korea-1nx9cbj","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Yahoo News Video","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-general-says-north-korea-002619595.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/muo0tEcvpYSGJsx1JaD6YA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-120960-1517444557462.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zMQS8_vM6HgtRgOjKt5loQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjgwO3c9NzIwOw--\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-120960-1517444557462.jpg","height":1280,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-120960-1517444557462.jpg","imgw":720,"imgh":1280,"title":"U.S. general says North Korea not demonstrated all components of ICBM","summary":null,"published_at":1517444934,"content_id":"e88ddc81-4417-3fd0-917d-25792fa074cc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-general-says-north-korea-002619595.html","content_published_at":1517444779,"content_time":1517444779,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"video_link","aspect":0.56},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c4563793-4ede-3c94-b806-76d340d6fd77","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-fe0ea4ce-a7e8-3e41-b1af-1789680a13db_a-c4563793-4ede-3c94-b806-76d340d6fd77","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-fe0ea4ce-a7e8-3e41-b1af-1789680a13db_a-c4563793-4ede-3c94-b806-76d340d6fd77","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/defying-u-russia-says-no-4xywrks","author":"nanook","provider":"US News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/world\/articles\/2018-01-31\/defying-us-russia-says-no-case-for-un-action-against-iran","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ttNEfiDp_dU6oEq22l.Obg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BMRcymiI1ZezNdSjUidJlA--\/dz03Mjg7aD00Nzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c4563793-4ede-3c94-b806-76d340d6fd77--179733847.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0Xss34QQCy0tAr2SPQIAPg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00Nzk7dz03Mjg7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BMRcymiI1ZezNdSjUidJlA--\/dz03Mjg7aD00Nzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c4563793-4ede-3c94-b806-76d340d6fd77--179733847.jpeg","height":479,"width":728,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BMRcymiI1ZezNdSjUidJlA--\/dz03Mjg7aD00Nzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c4563793-4ede-3c94-b806-76d340d6fd77--179733847.jpeg","imgw":728,"imgh":479,"title":"Defying U.S, Russia Says No Case for U.N.

else. The late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il Sung, are omnipresent on North Korean state television. It is as if the channel warns its viewers: This channel is of the Kims, by the Kims and for the Kims. My ABC News colleagues and I in Seoul spent all last week watching the communist state's broadcasts \u2014 from Jan. 22 to 26 \u2013 to get a glimpse into the average North Korean TV viewer's mind. By the end of the week, we had become fans of an animated North Korean measuring scale and were humming propaganda songs praising communism.

Fondue, the cheesy 1970s dinner party staple has seen a remarkable revival in recent years with John Lewis and Lakeland reporting a huge upsurge in kit sales in recent months. Waitrose also recently announced that online hits for its recipe for the classic Swiss meal - which often features a mix of gruyere, emmental, comte, appenzeller or cheddar - had soared by one third. However Professor Charles Spence, from the University of Oxford, said the trend was surprising given that the dish was not healthy, nor photogenic enough to be receiving an Instagram boost. Instead he believes Brexit and North Korea could be responsible, with global insecurity, the threat of nuclear war and the Swiss origins of fondue all combining to increase the dish\u2019s popularity. The origin of fondue may also be tapping into a desire for a Swizz-style Brexit\u00a0 Credit: Andrew Crowley\/Tiroler Hut Austrian Restaurant on Westbourne Grove Writing in the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science, Prof Spence, said: \u201cThe nostalgic, reassuring, element of fondue may be particularly appropriate at the present time when the world seems like such an unpredictable and dangerous place, what with the recent global financial crisis, the North Korean situation, Brexit, the Migrant Crisis, etc. \u201cConsumers tend to shift toward rounder cars at times when world seems like a dangerous place, and toward more angular forms when all is well with the world. \u201cIt would not seem unreasonable, I think, to suggest that nostalgic comfort foods become more appealing\/fashionable at those times of local\/global uncertainty too.\u201d Prof Spence, an experimental psychologist who helped design many of Heston Blumenthal\u2019s creations, also believes the Swiss heritage of fondue could also be tapping into an unconscious longing in diners. \u201cOne can\u2019t help feeling that at a time when the UK is figuring out if\/how to separate from the rest of Europe, that this nostalgic food stands originates from a part of Europe that stands outside the European Union but is still connected with the rest of the EU in much the way that many Brits would hope to achieve. \u201cPerhaps, then, the resurgence of the fondue can partly be explained by Brits trying, implicitly or otherwise, to convey an impression, or identity, through the food we eat of the future we would like for ourselves. \u201cIt is in this regard it would be hard to imagine that Black Forest Gateaux, Brie, or Bratwurst having anything like the same appeal at the present time here in the UK.\u201d Fondue also taps into the sharing trend Credit: Getty Images\u00a0 John Lewis said people were taking fondue much more seriously now, dipping meat in hot oil as well as the more well-known cheese version. There has also been a huge growth in sharing plates in recent years, which could explain some of the effect, said Prof Spence. The practice of dipping bread into cheese or meat into oil may also feel more like a participatory experience, which always increases enjoyment, a phenomenon known as the Ikea effect. \u201cOne can, of course, argue here about whether dipping pieces of meat into hot oil or wine or stale bread into a bubbling pot of gloopy cheese really counts as participatory, but it certainly seems like an idea worth countenancing,\u201d added Prof Spence.","published_at":1523367055,"content_id":"b27e80b9-0288-3ce9-88ba-02a7f58c1d2c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/brexit-north-korea-driving-fondue-132609895.html","content_published_at":1523366769,"content_time":1523366769,"content_relative_time":78,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":78,"comment_relative_time":78,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

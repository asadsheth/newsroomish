BBC One\u2019s new drama, McMafia, has taken a different approach. The casting team turned to Russia in search of talent after deciding that audiences are now \u201ctoo sophisticated\u201d to take cod foreign accents seriously. McMafia\u2019s international cast includes Maria Shukshina, an actress dubbed \u201cthe Meryl Streep of Russia\u201d. Characters who hail from Georgia, Israel, the Czech Republic and India are played by actors from those countries. James Norton stars as the London-raised son of Russian exiles, who finds himself drawn into a world of international crime. \u201cWe had no British actors doing dodgy Russian accents,\u201d Norton said. It is a marked departure from War and Peace, the BBC\u2019s last big-budget drama to feature Russian characters - including Norton as Prince Andrei. The stars who attempted a Russian accent - and those who didn't Critics derided the 2016 production for its lack of authenticity when it came to accents, with the Telegraph noting that \u201cthe posh Russian characters speak English with public school English accents\u201d while the peasants had regional British accents. The 2015 Tom Hardy film, Child 44, also came under fire. One critic said it was \u201cfull of actors speaking English with vyery hyeavy Ryussian accyents\u201d; it was unclear whether Hardy was joking when he claimed to have drawn accent inspiration from The Count in Sesame Street. Explaining the casting decision, McMafia\u2019s director and co-writer, James Watkins, said: \u201cIt was incredibly important to us to cast globally, for the authenticity. One of the first discussions we had with our partners was that when we depicted Russia, we wanted the language to be Russian, so needed to cast Russian actors. Minnie Driver played a Russian singer in GoldenEye Credit: Keith Hamshere\/Moviepix \u201cI think audiences are far too sophisticated now to have an English actor putting on a Russian accent - it feels fake. \u201cIn order to immerse people in these worlds we wanted to seek out the best actors in these different countries, Russia, Israel, Georgia, Czech Republic, etc. It was fantastic working with people from different worlds as everyone has the same approach but different processes.\u201d The 2012 version of Anna Karenina, starring Keira Knightley, made no attempt at Russian accents Credit: Film Stills McMafia is a sign of things to come, the first of several BBC commissions to employ an international cast. The corporation is adapting A Suitable Boy, Vikram Seth\u2019s lengthy family saga set in 1950s India, with an entirely Indian cast. Another BBC One drama, Giri\/Haji is set between Britain and Japan, and features a Tokyo detective who travels to London in search of a younger brother who has become involved with Yakuza crime gangs. Giri\/Haji is a co-production with Netflix, who will stream the series globally after it premieres on the BBC. McMafia is being distributed in more than 200 countries and territories by Amazon, and the international market is another reason why casting is becoming a global business.

Movies: Scores of superheroes, sequels are coming to the big screen","summary":"2017 may not have been the greatest year for movies at the box office, but that hasn't deterred the big studios from launching the same kinds of films in 2018 \u2014 led by lots of superheroes, not unlike most years this past decade. And who can blame Hollywood? Three of last year's top five films were comic book adaptations; five of the top 10 and seven of the most popular 13 were, too. So it's no wonder that 2018's most anticipated movie has more costumed characters than you can sanely count crammed into a single feature. In fact, \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d is so overstuffed with Marvel men, women and alien species that it's already got a sequel coming in 2019 to handle the spillover.

Daniels' new attorney,\u00a0Michael Avenatti, has been a fixture on TV. Daniels herself is scheduled to be interviewed on 60 Minutes on March 25. But another woman, former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal, whose story has attracted significantly less attention, may end up being a bigger problem for Trump. (McDougal will appear on TV this Thursday on CNN with Anderson Cooper.) In some respects, McDougal's story is similar to Daniels'. Like Daniels, she met Trump at a 2006 golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Trump later wined and dined both women at the Beverly Hills Hotel.","published_at":1521648240,"content_id":"76ab0881-b64c-38ae-87c7-40ab0b4d13bd","content_url":"https:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/stormy-daniels-is-in-the-headlines-but-karen-mcdougal-is-a-bigger-problem-for-trump-8e92be797141\/","content_published_at":1521648240,"content_time":1521648240,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":10,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-106262a1-a3e5-3acb-83b0-9b6e09476a57_a-106262a1-a3e5-3acb-83b0-9b6e09476a57","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-106262a1-a3e5-3acb-83b0-9b6e09476a57_a-106262a1-a3e5-3acb-83b0-9b6e09476a57","author":"Yahoo

She successfully\u00a0faked a trip to Disneyland, proving just how deceptive social media can be, and how we shouldn't view it\u00a0as a true measure of reality. Carolyn Stritch is a 32-year-old photographer, blogger, and Instagram influencer from the U.K., and she often shares picture-perfect shots and behind-the-scenes stories from her adventures on her lifestyle blog, The Slow Traveler. But for her latest journey, Stritch set out to encourage her followers to \u201cquestion everything\u201d when it comes to the aspirational images they see on their feeds each day.","published_at":1521631681,"content_id":"3c89afaf-a60e-39f7-b6df-70c08480b8ce","content_url":"https:\/\/hellogiggles.com\/news\/woman-faked-trip-to-disneyland\/","content_published_at":1521631681,"content_time":1521631681,"content_relative_time":8,"reaction_count":4,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-611e8982-b21b-33a7-a66a-e03bcf4392f7_c-f0b478f8-989a-329e-8d9a-9d739c50b6d0_a-f0b478f8-989a-329e-8d9a-9d739c50b6d0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/crime-justice\/v-611e8982-b21b-33a7-a66a-e03bcf4392f7_c-f0b478f8-989a-329e-8d9a-9d739c50b6d0_a-f0b478f8-989a-329e-8d9a-9d739c50b6d0","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/son-accused-killing-parents-dad-031110071.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C_.936miSgp3WClmKOcx8Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/a25b7d05cf05cb84be025eb0045d46f2","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CbtRT9ucRYLMwHZUBjwDfg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNTQwO3c9MjAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/a25b7d05cf05cb84be025eb0045d46f2","height":1540,"width":2000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/a25b7d05cf05cb84be025eb0045d46f2","imgw":2000,"imgh":1540,"title":"Son Accused of Killing Parents After Dad\u2019s Chilling Warning: 'If You Don\u2019t Hear From Me, Call 911'","summary":"21-Year-Old Accused of Killing Parents After Dad's Chilling Warning","published_at":1521601870,"content_id":"f0b478f8-989a-329e-8d9a-9d739c50b6d0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/son-accused-killing-parents-dad-031110071.html","content_published_at":1521601870,"content_time":1521601870,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":1162,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96_a-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96_a-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Fox News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/food-drink\/2018\/03\/20\/mcdonald-s-customer-turns-violent-after-receiving-wrong-breakfast-order.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/A8S3dsOmmK4844yw1wjZVg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qLbxP1PvUnJ.jF.8rnB6Uw--\/dz05MzE7aD01MjQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96-880525832.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/I8ElXAgiTokd5HPiGZfK4w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MjQ7dz05MzE7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qLbxP1PvUnJ.jF.8rnB6Uw--\/dz05MzE7aD01MjQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96-880525832.jpeg","height":524,"width":931,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qLbxP1PvUnJ.jF.8rnB6Uw--\/dz05MzE7aD01MjQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96-880525832.jpeg","imgw":931,"imgh":524,"title":"McDonald's customer turns violent after receiving wrong breakfast order","summary":"Police in Glendale, Wis., are currently seeking the public's help in identifying an irate McDonald's customer who assaulted a teenage employee after receiving the wrong breakfast order.

Mark Conditt died in the early hours of Wednesday when a SWAT team closed in on his vehicle near Round Rock, 20 miles from Austin. \u00a0Police said that they had learnt of his identity in the previous 24 hours, when he had dropped off a package at a FedEx in Austin and was caught on CCTV. They then obtained his Google search records, and found suspicious activity. Conditt lived in the Pflugerville suburb of Austin - close to the home of his parents. He had three younger sisters, and all were predominately home-schooled by their mother,\u00a0Danene Conditt. As part of his studies he appears to have written a blog, with six postings discussing social and political issues between January and May 2012. Introducing himself, he wrote:\u00a0\"I enjoy cycling, parkour, tennis, reading, and listening to music. \"I am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended. \"The reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\" His postings show him to be of moderate conservative leanings - against gay marriage and abortion, and in favour of the death penalty. Mrs Conditt\u00a0posted a photo her son in February 2013 on Facebook, saying: \"I officially graduated Mark from High School on Friday. 1 down, 3 to go. He has 30 hrs of college credit too, but he's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do....maybe a mission trip. Thanks to everyone for your support over the years.\" After completing his studies Conditt worked at Crux Semiconductor Manufacturing in Austin, and had been previously employed as a computer repair technician. His work at Crux will certainly come under the scrutiny of police, as they try to piece together how he obtained the bomb-making equipment. TMZ reported that at Crux his role was\u00a0\"purchasing agent\/buyer\/shipping and receiving\" for the company, which is involved in robotics, mechanical repair and metal products. Candy Buchleitner has lived near the family for five years, keeping chickens in her backyard. She told The Telegraph that the neighborhood is normally very quiet, and home to mostly older people.

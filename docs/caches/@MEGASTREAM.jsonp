Errol Musk, 72, described the 10-month-old baby boy he had with Jana Bezuidenhout, 30, as \u201cexquisite\u201d. He married her mother Heide when Jana was four but told The Sunday Times he did not consider her to be his stepdaughter because she had been raised away from the family for long periods of time. Jana Bezuidenhout, 30, who had a child with her stepfather Errol Musk He had two children with Ms Bezuidenhout\u2019s mother before divorcing after 18 years of marriage. He said Jana had contacted him last year after splitting up with a boyfriend. \u201cWe were lonely, lost people,\u201d he said from his home in South Africa. \u201cOne thing led to another \u2014 you can call it God\u2019s plan or nature\u2019s plan.\u201d Two months later Jana told him she was pregnant. After assuming the father was her ex-boyfriend, Mr Musk demanded a paternity test only to discover it was his baby. \u201cJana is a delightful girl and a wonderful mother. She said I had changed her life,\u201d he added. Elon Musk railed against his father in a recent interview Credit: Reuters His story may explain months of hostility between father and son, who have reportedly not spoken in more than a year. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Elon Musk \u2013 who is though to be worth about $20 billion \u2013\u00a0described his father as a \u201cterrible human being\u201d but stopped short of talking about specific examples. In quotes | Elon Musk \u201cYou have no idea about how bad,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.\u201d Mr Musk senior, who is a millionaire and made his fortune through engineering, disputed that characterisation but has admitted shooting dead three intruders in his home in South Africa. He was charged with manslaughter but said he was acting in self-defence and was acquitted.","published_at":1521989388,"content_id":"4755d33b-852f-3941-a494-cb8d988ce1aa","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/elon-musk-apos-father-baby-144948117.html","content_published_at":1521989388,"content_time":1521989388,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":714,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-901d9ca8-8fbf-3d87-a986-8700a28cb613_c-e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e_a-e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mma\/v-901d9ca8-8fbf-3d87-a986-8700a28cb613_c-e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e_a-e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"New York Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/03\/26\/mma-fighter-why-i-front-flipped-off-knocked-out-foe\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OG4znJGUVS5Ll9h3oibMEA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D8s6YhzXFUCx1DmrxdZ_Cg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e--990408371.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z05IhaSrMAvsS.StHFtMwA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D8s6YhzXFUCx1DmrxdZ_Cg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e--990408371.jpeg","height":800,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D8s6YhzXFUCx1DmrxdZ_Cg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e0b72026-f8ec-3588-94e4-87ef3561162e--990408371.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":800,"title":"MMA fighter: Why I front-flipped off knocked-out foe","summary":"Drew Chatman skipped right over fame and went straight to infamy\u00a0in his professional MMA debut Saturday night, when his bonkers knockout of\u00a0Irvins Ayala was instantly annulled by Chatman's own stupidity.

Ralph Peters, a retired Lt. Col. for the army and until recently a Fox News strategic analyst, decided to leave his post at the station after finally having a moment of clarity.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: What the hell is up with those bizarre Fox News Apple alerts? Peters' departure was first reported by BuzzFeed News, which obtained a copy of an email announcing his departure and detailing his reasoning to his colleagues.\u00a0 \"Today, I feel that Fox News is assaulting our constitutional order and the rule of law, while fostering corrosive and unjustified paranoia among viewers,\" Peters wrote in the email. \"Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association. Now I am ashamed.\" Peters continued by saying he thought that Fox News \"degenerated from providing a legitimate and much-needed outlet for conservative voices to a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically ruinous administration.\" Hard to believe it took him this long to realize it, but be assured he hasn't had a total change of heart. Peters, who was briefly suspended from the network \u00a0several years ago for calling then President Obama a \"total pussy\" on live TV over his terrorism strategy, used his goodbye letter to take a dig at him one last time while simultaneously bashing Trump and Fox News' hosts. \"As a Russia analyst for many years, it also has appalled me that hosts who made their reputations as super-patriots and who, justifiably, savaged President Obama for his duplicitous folly with Putin, now advance Putin's agenda by making light of Russian penetration of our elections and the Trump campaign,\" Peters wrote.\u00a0 Fox News wasn't just going to let Peters trash talk the network, however, saying he was using his opinion \"as a weapon in order to gain attention.\" NEW - Statement from Fox News on Ralph Peters email: \"Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention. We are extremely proud of our top-rated primetime hosts and all of our opinion programing.\u201d \u2014 Jeremy Barr (@jeremymbarr) March 20, 2018 The full email from Peters to his colleagues at Fox News can be read below:","published_at":1521587513,"content_id":"b0cbad97-30d8-3765-9d56-5533582f3971","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fox-news-analyst-quits-finally-231153791.html","content_published_at":1521587513,"content_time":1521587513,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":3370,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-ce2f417f-637f-3c99-b05d-3ce68f4f6daa_c-ac16985f-2fc2-3067-a1d5-c7e2168f3cc7_a-ac16985f-2fc2-3067-a1d5-c7e2168f3cc7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/fashion\/v-ce2f417f-637f-3c99-b05d-3ce68f4f6daa_c-ac16985f-2fc2-3067-a1d5-c7e2168f3cc7_a-ac16985f-2fc2-3067-a1d5-c7e2168f3cc7","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"W","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/seoul-fashion-weeks-street-style-141810261.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6W.YFJRkkWyt1uLWWOrxJg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/w_988\/d1cd3d6ac3a765d27571a27da852746e","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WWzWSPO_kAIpS3dciKfaOQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDI4O3c9MTU0Mjs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/w_988\/d1cd3d6ac3a765d27571a27da852746e","height":1028,"width":1542,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/w_988\/d1cd3d6ac3a765d27571a27da852746e","imgw":1542,"imgh":1028,"title":"Seoul Fashion Week's Street Style Stars Are Here to Give a Master Class on Layering","summary":null,"published_at":1521641890,"content_id":"ac16985f-2fc2-3067-a1d5-c7e2168f3cc7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/seoul-fashion-weeks-street-style-141810261.html","content_published_at":1521641890,"content_time":1521641890,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"photoset_link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-9d81a081-1e96-3f77-b1a5-4c601668b5ff_a-9d81a081-1e96-3f77-b1a5-4c601668b5ff","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/facebook\/v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-9d81a081-1e96-3f77-b1a5-4c601668b5ff_a-9d81a081-1e96-3f77-b1a5-4c601668b5ff","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Engadget","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/morning-uber-halts-self-driving-105700048.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/z5.XNOPjcKUGbuvYIgnvNg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/engadget_479\/f64f725e037ff6e11f695383e448a0ed","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZZ9j.1k2X64w_KX1MVKx1Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMjA7dz00ODA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/engadget_479\/f64f725e037ff6e11f695383e448a0ed","height":320,"width":480,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/engadget_479\/f64f725e037ff6e11f695383e448a0ed","imgw":480,"imgh":320,"title":"The Morning After: More problems for Facebook","summary":"Welcome to Tuesday morning.

Daniels' new attorney,\u00a0Michael Avenatti, has been a fixture on TV. Daniels herself is scheduled to be interviewed on 60 Minutes on March 25. But another woman, former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal, whose story has attracted significantly less attention, may end up being a bigger problem for Trump. (McDougal will appear on TV this Thursday on CNN with Anderson Cooper.) In some respects, McDougal's story is similar to Daniels'. Like Daniels, she met Trump at a 2006 golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.

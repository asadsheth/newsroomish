Police in North Port, approximately 60 miles south of Tampa, said 32-year-old John Christopher Ludwick was pronounced dead at a local hospital after 7 a.m. Investigators say Ludwick attacked the unidentified woman in her driveway and was stabbed in the ensuing struggle. Authorities said Ludwick and his would-be victim knew each other, but declined to elaborate. Last year, Ludwick claimed that Joran van der Sloot -- the prime suspect in Holloway's disappearance -- paid him $1,500 to dig up her body in 2010, five years after the 18-year-old vanished on the Dutch Caribbean island.","published_at":1521078300,"content_id":"820ea334-1851-3a30-a3ec-ea856f08ae33","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/03\/14\/man-who-claimed-cremated-natalee-holloway-killed-while-attempting-kidnapping-police-say.html","content_published_at":1521078300,"content_time":1521078300,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":93,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/donald-trump\/v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"POPSUGAR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Trump-Tweet-About-Obama-Staff-Turnover-Rate-44666788","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cdk2qZGBJOBAfGkGC2BlnQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0usQsnybJ0sht0i5FwrcuA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"This Old Trump Tweet Is Coming Back to Haunt Him \u2014 Because, Well, Just Read It","summary":"It's no secret that President Donald Trump isn't the best at keeping officials in his administration around for very long.

Well, until next season... Last night's episode started and ended with a wedding. First, we were given a heartbreaking (and highly speculated) flash-forward sequence with Rebecca and Jack renewing their vows on their 40th anniversary. Then, it was all about Kate and Toby. And it was very emotional (obviously). We all expected Kate to honor her late father on the big day \u2014 and she did it in a not-so-obvious way. Some thought Kevin would lend her his necklace. Others thought she'd incorporate his ashes into her wedding look. But did you notice the Easter egg that was in the middle of Kate's bouquet?

The recommendation from the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility came after an internal report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general accused the FBI veteran of misleading investigators looking into an array of matters connected to the 2016 presidential campaign, the source said. McCabe is worried that if he were to be fired in the next few days, before he is officially eligible for his retirement benefits, he could lose a full pension that he has built after nearly 22 years of public service, according to sources familiar with McCabe\u2019s thinking.","published_at":1521063120,"content_id":"a41659ed-bb5c-309a-898a-fb52a8a6cbab","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/fbi-officials-recommend-former-deputy-director-mccabe-fired-213200790--abc-news-topstories.html","content_published_at":1521063120,"content_time":1521063120,"content_relative_time":18,"reaction_count":347,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0db023ef-1095-313e-95f7-248c1bbb6cf0_c-1a2916e6-e127-3d12-a791-75b99b5626ee_a-1a2916e6-e127-3d12-a791-75b99b5626ee","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl.t.6\/v-0db023ef-1095-313e-95f7-248c1bbb6cf0_c-1a2916e6-e127-3d12-a791-75b99b5626ee_a-1a2916e6-e127-3d12-a791-75b99b5626ee","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/nfl-free-agency-five-potential-222303799.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cW1gEMQrpVNqVsjxqSG8mA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/f38fd1025701c87a39900c11c0382802","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JNFdB0cCzsC2CaB.AiSn5Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/f38fd1025701c87a39900c11c0382802","height":1080,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/f38fd1025701c87a39900c11c0382802","imgw":1920,"imgh":1080,"title":"NFL free agency: Five potential landing spots for Tyrann Mathieu","summary":"The Cardinals' loss can be a contender's gain, and there is no shortage of teams that will contend if they sign Tyrann Mathieu, who was released Wednesday.","published_at":1521066183,"content_id":"1a2916e6-e127-3d12-a791-75b99b5626ee","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/nfl-free-agency-five-potential-222303799.html","content_published_at":1521066183,"content_time":1521066183,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":14,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05_a-7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05_a-7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2018\/03\/nascar-radio-audio-darrell-bubba-wallace-jr-harvick-busch-video-phoenix-ism","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JUpnCcCa8vI.2bnZe7i7rQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sglqsMxhFukbFHp3Me6bDg--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05-1011343147.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uWqgDAYwKtgF0JKEgxFszg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sglqsMxhFukbFHp3Me6bDg--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05-1011343147.jpeg","height":576,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sglqsMxhFukbFHp3Me6bDg--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7240d0d7-3413-3648-b76d-ba3e59299e05-1011343147.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":576,"title":"Bubba Wallace got scolded after singing a made-up song during NASCAR race","summary":"Road rage, confusion, swear words, name-calling \u2013 these are all things NASCAR fans expect to hear when they listen to the radio audio from during a race.

Burks' ability to play fill the \u201cstar\u201d slot in the Commodore defense gave the team a hybrid linebacker-safety who could sneak up to the line of scrimmage and wallop tailbacks or drop into coverage and play centerfield against the SEC's top passing attacks. Burks' NFL prospects were an under-the-radar discussion until he opened scouts' eyes in Indianapolis, running a 4.59-second 40-yard dash time and ripping off a 39.5 inch vertical leap at 233 pounds to stake his claim as one of the 2018 NFL Draft's elite athletes.","published_at":1524490556,"content_id":"9fd4a5c0-53be-363d-9f5b-2d05558a583b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.anchorofgold.com\/2018\/4\/23\/17269028\/2018-nfl-draft-oren-burks-vanderbilt-defender-to-make-an-impact-in-the-nfl","content_published_at":1524459600,"content_time":1524459600,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"386e0d86-d71b-355a-a67a-d2233df774c9","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-572c9baa-1e3e-345b-9c19-aeccd0b0ea73_a-386e0d86-d71b-355a-a67a-d2233df774c9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-572c9baa-1e3e-345b-9c19-aeccd0b0ea73_a-386e0d86-d71b-355a-a67a-d2233df774c9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/only-2-giants-jets-players-14aohn7","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"NY Daily News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/sports\/football\/giants\/2-giants-jets-players-top-50-nfl-jersey-sales-list-article-1.3949630","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/g1xyi_x1tSpdqfkDVLZW8A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lEe9QxWNFhHa9arIx1obOw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_386e0d86-d71b-355a-a67a-d2233df774c9--190878023.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IZld7j4tyX1HuST4lt0M9w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lEe9QxWNFhHa9arIx1obOw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_386e0d86-d71b-355a-a67a-d2233df774c9--190878023.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lEe9QxWNFhHa9arIx1obOw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_386e0d86-d71b-355a-a67a-d2233df774c9--190878023.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Only 2 Giants and Jets players make Top 50 NFL jersey sales list","summary":"Tom Brady's No. 12 jersey topped the NFL Players Association's Top 50 Sales List for the second time in three years.

They're difficult to find in the later rounds of the draft, and they almost never become available in free agency. This is precisely why the Bills were willing to pull the trigger on Penn State product Aaron Maybin with the 11th overall pick back in 2009. Maybin had just one year of full-time starting experience before deciding to go pro, but his stock after that year was high. The sophomore finished the 2008 season with 12.0 sacks and 20.0 tackles for loss. He was also a finalist for the Chuck Bednarik Award, given to the nation's top defender. The knock on Maybin was that he was raw and undersized.

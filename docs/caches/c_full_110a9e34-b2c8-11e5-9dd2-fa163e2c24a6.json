The Seahawks contacted Kaepernick approximately two weeks ago to arrange a visit before the plans were altered unexpectedly due to his anthem stance, Schefter reported, citing a source. Per Schefter, Kaepernick was unwilling to say that he would alter his anthem stance that began in 2016 as a means to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The workout had been scheduled for Monday, according to Pro Football Talk, which added that it was only when the workout date approached that the Seahawks contacted Kaepernick to request that he commit to standing for the anthem.","published_at":1523564279,"content_id":"34486024-381b-3ffd-a1fb-8d5610704786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Sports_News\/NFL\/2018\/04\/12\/Report-Kaepernicks-visit-with-Seahawks-postponed\/9201523560112\/","content_published_at":1523560283,"content_time":1523560283,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":26,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e9f21712-c88a-3683-86f8-c86d0bb82a50_a-5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/nfl\/2018\/04\/12\/nfl-rejects-burficts-appeal-upholds-4-game-suspension\/33779589\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wQL4qwuR4c9Z.T75GmYXAA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NvNLBQ0ujLv8d2HaTvj9_g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STlNQaNq2A1a0FpLHwItvQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5cd1cb36-15d2-393b-83e5-1ea168d38cad-1766490975.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"NFL rejects Burfict's appeal, upholds 4-game suspension","summary":"CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict will be sidelined to start a season for the fourth year in a row, this time serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancers.

Most hope that will come in the form of a 1,000-yard, eight-touchdown season (or better), which would warrant a long-term\u00a0deal for the veteran. Unfortunately, NFL.com's Nate Burleson doesn't see that happening as he projected Moncrief to put up similar figures to those he had in 2017. Old team: Indianapolis Colts. With Jacksonville shipping its top two receivers away \u2014 Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns \u2014 Moncrief has the opportunity to be productive.

The running back is no longer a \"premier\" position in the draft -- NFL teams would much rather use a high pick on a quarterback, offensive tackle, pass-rusher, or wide receiver. Proponents of advanced statistics have been at the forefront of this change of thinking, pointing out that running backs often have short careers and are usually replaced with ease. Accordingly, any team willing to go against this trend and use a high pick on Barkley should be fairly certain that he is likely to live up to his hype.

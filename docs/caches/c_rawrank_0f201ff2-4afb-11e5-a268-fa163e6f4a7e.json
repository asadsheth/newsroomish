The ability to seriously evaluate each of these and other related provisions in the next few weeks and do it with the approval and support of our allies is near impossible. Without a comprehensive and well thought out strategy working closely with our allies, this president is likely to walk into a summit believing that the strength of his personality alone plus his gut instincts will be enough to prevail. Added to this is the large turnover of key personnel in critical national security positions, some of whom will have to go through a time consuming nomination process in the Senate.","published_at":1522817974,"content_id":"a28653e3-4ba3-3e3e-9ccb-dd3be9eb6bbd","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/04\/03\/trump-has-2-choices-to-avoid-disaster-at-north-korea-summit-leon-panetta.html","content_published_at":1522769157,"content_time":1522769157,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":2,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-18958d42-2c09-3a9f-ae98-1ac254e1c614_a-de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-18958d42-2c09-3a9f-ae98-1ac254e1c614_a-de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-18958d42-2c09-3a9f-ae98-1ac254e1c614_a-de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Intercept","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2018\/04\/03\/north-korea-nuclear-trump-john-bolton\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EDkVmFfImIDnHbbYmbRlOA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Co5ilmTQh5cBRuYrCsS9g--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402--1389386824.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uK.kLTc1J52X7dIaz_RIkw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Co5ilmTQh5cBRuYrCsS9g--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402--1389386824.jpeg","height":800,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Co5ilmTQh5cBRuYrCsS9g--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_de3be646-f6c9-3b28-94fa-815ae5982402--1389386824.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":800,"title":"How John Bolton Wants to Destroy the Constitution to Attack North Korea","summary":"Several weeks before President Donald Trump announced that John Bolton would soon become his new national security adviser, Bolton wrote a peculiar op-ed for The Wall Street Journal titled \u201cThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.\u201d What made Bolton's column odd was not his belligerence \u2014 he's always been the embodiment of America's violent id in human\/mustache form \u2014 but rather his invocation of \u201cinternational law.\u201d According to Bolton, it is now legal for the U.S. to attack North Korea.

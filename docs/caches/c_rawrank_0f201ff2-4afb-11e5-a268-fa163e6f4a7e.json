But the strikes also had a broader purpose: showing other regimes that the Obama era of U.S. weakness was over, and that America's adversaries would have to adjust their calculations about our willingness to act in response to their provocations. Now, a year later, the Assad regime has reportedly defied Trump by its apparent launch of another chemical weapons attack. Once again, how Trump responds will have consequences far beyond Syria.

spy may have been poisoned via air vents in his BMW, intelligence officials believe\u00a0","summary":"Sergei Skripal and his daughter may have been exposed to the nerve agent used in their attempted assassination through the Russian spy\u2019s car ventilation system, intelligence sources have told a US television channel. ABC News said sources had told it that intelligence officials \u201cnow have a clearer picture of just how the attack was conducted\u201d. Agencies reportedly\u00a0now believe the toxin - identified as a fourth generation nerve agent called Novichok - was used in a \u201cdust-like powdered form\u201d and that it circulated through the vents of Colonel Skripal\u2019s BMW. ABC News, citing three intelligence officials, said that the Novichok agent had been delivered in a powdered form. \u201cIt is a Cold War substance, something they [Russia] claimed never to have,\u201d an intelligence official told ABC News. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned\u00a0 The US news channel said that claims that Skripal was angry - he allegedly had been shouting and \u201cacting incoherently\u201d - in a pizza restaurant\u00a0before his collapse was consistent with the early stages of exposure to a nerve agent. Boris Johnson has claimed that Britain has evidence from within the last decade that Russia has been \u201ccreating and stockpiling\u201d the Novichok nerve agent used in the attack. Moscow has long insisted that the production of chemical agents stopped in 1992 and that its stockpile of material was completely destroyed by\u00a02017. But Mr Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, said the UK had evidence \u201cwithin the last 10 years\u201d that Russia had been making such nerve agents and investigating how to use them for assassinations. Mr Johnson\u2019s claims came in response to comments made by Vladimir Chizhov, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, who insisted \u201cRussia had nothing to do\u201d with the poisoning of the former double agent and his daughter. Mr Chizhov also risked the further worsening of relations between the UK and Russia as he suggested that the nerve agent identified in Salisbury may have come from the UK Government\u2019s nearby Porton Down defence laboratory. Mr Johnson said Russia\u2019s response to the incident was \u201cnot the response of a country that really believes itself to be innocent\u201d as he detailed the UK\u2019s belief that Moscow had been making chemical agents in recent years. He told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: \u201cI might just say in response to Mr Chizhov\u2019s point about Russian stockpiles of chemical weapons, we actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination but has also been creating and stockpiling Novichok itself.\u201d He continued: \u201cListening to the Russian response, listening again to the response of the Russian ambassador to the EU, with his satirical suggestion that this was done by UK agents from Porton Down, this is not the response of a country that really believes itself to be innocent. \u201cThis is not the response of a country that really wants to engage in getting to the bottom of the matter.\u201d Mr Chizhov had earlier suggested that Russia had never actually made the Novichok agent, telling the same programme: \u201cNo. Actually, Russia has stopped production of any chemical agents back in 1992. \u201cSo you cannot even talk about any chemical agents produced by Russia. All that had been produced previously was produced by the Soviet Union. \u201cIn 1992, the then president Boris Yeltsin signed a decree stopping all production and according to the international convention of prohibition of chemical weapons last year in 2017 Russia destroyed all its stockpiles. \u201cThere is only one country today which hasn\u2019t done so, which is still retaining its chemical stockpiles, and that is the United States of America.\u201d Salisbury spy attack timeline He then appeared to suggest that the nerve agent may have come from Porton Down. He said: \u201cBut when you have a nerve agent or whatever you check it against certain samples that you will retain at your laboratories and Porton Down as we now all know is the largest military facility in the United Kingdom, that has been dealing with chemical weapons research and it is actually only eight miles from Salisbury.\u201d Asked if he was actually suggesting that Porton Down may have been responsible for the nerve agent, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Theresa May told MPs in the House of Commons on Monday that Mr Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok \u201ca military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia\u201d. Russian spy poisoning | Read more The Prime Minister then said on Wednesday that there was \u201cno alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable\u201d for the poisoning as she expelled 23 Russian diplomats \u201cidentified as undeclared intelligence officers\u201d in retaliation. Russia responded on Sunday by expelling 23 UK diplomats. Mr Johnson confirmed that experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will come to the UK on Monday to begin the process for the testing of\u00a0samples of the nerve agent found in Salisbury.","published_at":1521640852,"content_id":"20df29c6-ea18-35a5-9965-d4462734f253","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/boris-johnson-russia-apos-creating-110531828.html","content_published_at":1521380836,"content_time":1521380836,"content_relative_time":78,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":78,"comment_relative_time":78,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

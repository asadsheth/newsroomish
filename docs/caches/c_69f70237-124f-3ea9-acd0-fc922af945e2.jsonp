Oil output rose to 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, a revision from earlier estimates, the EIA said. December production fell 108,000 bpd to 9.949 million bpd, it said. November's figure exceeded the 10.044 million barrels produced daily in November 1970. Output has surged in the last several years due to the shale boom, pushing the United States past Saudi Arabia among top producers. Only Russia now has greater daily oil output.

The Syrian Democratic Forces, a secular and largely Kurdish group established by the Pentagon in October 2015, has been the leading ally of the U.S. in Syria since relations with the mostly Sunni Muslim Arab opposition trying to overthrow Assad since 2011\u00a0fell out. As Washington's priorities shifted from regime change to defeating ISIS, the Syrian Democratic Forces served as the vanguard to U.S. ground efforts to fight the jihadis, which have been largely defeated\u00a0by both pro-Syrian government and U.S.-led campaigns as of late last year.","published_at":1520268638,"content_id":"fac0ec89-d716-3399-acd7-e3f8bf9d40ae","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/u-losing-top-syria-war-184141335.html","content_published_at":1520016101,"content_time":1520016101,"content_relative_time":76,"reaction_count":248,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":76,"comment_relative_time":76,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"69df8698-d496-34ff-83ef-76cd4173f196","post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-84e7eb2c-7d2a-333b-a4cb-b8b7c4ebf9b0_a-69df8698-d496-34ff-83ef-76cd4173f196","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-84e7eb2c-7d2a-333b-a4cb-b8b7c4ebf9b0_a-69df8698-d496-34ff-83ef-76cd4173f196","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/vladimir-putin-made-absurd-argument-4vf412e","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/vladimir-putin-russia-election-interference-megyn-kelly-2018-3","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nrslGlutpn7BA.bk3CGzcQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/joxU2qEgsNpUDX6uEQMVrA--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_69df8698-d496-34ff-83ef-76cd4173f196-377190675.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lXc9Z1Zt2CCDZE6Ze2z0Lg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/joxU2qEgsNpUDX6uEQMVrA--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_69df8698-d496-34ff-83ef-76cd4173f196-377190675.jpeg","height":375,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/joxU2qEgsNpUDX6uEQMVrA--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_69df8698-d496-34ff-83ef-76cd4173f196-377190675.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":375,"title":"Vladimir Putin made an absurd argument for why he can't respond to accusations of Russian election interference","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin said during an interview with NBC's Megyn Kelly that he would not be able to respond to the US's accusations of Russian election interference if the underlying conduct did not violate Russian law.

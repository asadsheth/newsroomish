seekers will have to hand over cash and phones, Austria's new coalition says","summary":"Asylum seekers in Austria will have to hand over their mobile phones and money as part of an asylum application, Austria's new conservative and far-Right coalition announced. Under the plan unveiled after the two parties were sworn in yesterday, Austria will seek to stop illegal immigration and ensure that people whose asylum claims are rejected are quickly deported. Asylum is \"temporary protection\" only, the policy states. The money seized by authorities will apparently be used to cover basic care costs, while mobile phone data will be trawled through to clarify identities, the coalition said. Austria\u2019s far-Right Freedom Party secured its return to power yesterday (MON), as the president swore in the country\u2019s new government amid protests on the streets of Vienna. Sebastian Kurz, of the conservative People's Party (OVP), is now the new Austrian chancellor, after he reached a deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), which was founded by former members of the Nazi party, on Friday. Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the nationalist FPO will be the new vice chancellor. Austria is now the only western European country with a far-right party in government. And at just 31, Kurz is the youngest leader in Europe, after his party won the October 15th election with 32 percent of the vote. The nationalist FPO came third with 26 percent of the vote. \u00a0 Mr Kurz won the election with a hard line on immigration that overlapped with the FPO. The future leaders presented their approximately 180-page government programme on Sunday, and said that they planned to do things \u201cmuch better\u201d and that \u201cnobody had anything to fear\u201d. New Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is flanked by Austrian President Alexander Van Der Bellen, right, and new Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, left Credit: \u00a0Ronald Zak\/\u00a0AP Mr Strache said on Facebook on Sunday that the new government will also slash benefits for asylum seekers. \"It will no longer happen for migrants who have never worked here a single day or paid anything into the social system to get thousands of Euros in welfare,\" he wrote. Austria should be a land of diversity, Mr Kurz also said \u2013 but pointed out that it should also have basic values that apply to all. The coalition\u2019s motto is \"time for the new\", as they promise to establish a new political style in the country. \u00a0 In a speech to swear in the new chancellor, President Van der Bellen urged the coalition to adopt a responsible policy, especially towards minorities. \"Working with the weakest shows what our values \u200b\u200bare really worth,\" he said. \u00a0 Around 6,000 people packed out Heroes Square in the centre of Vienna to protest, according to police, waving placards that said \u201crefugees welcome\u201d and \u201cno Nazi pigs\u201d. There was also a heavy police presence, including helicopters and water cannon. Austria election results 2017 On Tuesday Mr Kurz will travel to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Donald Tusk, the president of the European Commission, amid widespread concern that Austria\u2019s swing to the right will further exacerbate EU divisions. Mr Kurz has already ruled out a referendum on membership of the European Union and stressed that the new government should be pro-EU, but last week he said he would follow countries such as Hungary and Poland in rejecting the bloc\u2019s mandatory migrant relocation quotas.\u00a0 Mr Kurz has also emphasised that he wants to work in close cooperation with Germany. \u201cWe are very connected with Germany - human, economic, political and cultural,\u201d he told Bild newspaper. \u201cI look forward to further cooperation with the German federal government, in particular with Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u201d he said. But there has been mixed reaction in Germany. Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Angela Merkel, said \"we are ready for a close and trusting cooperation.\" But that it \u201cgoes without saying\u201d that this should always happen on the \"basis of the values \u200b\u200bthat we have given for Europe\".\u00a0 While the Social Democrats (SPD), with whom Mrs Merkel is hoping to form a new government, have reacted with horror. \"Austria-Hungary is back. With Chancellor Kurz, fraternity member Strache and arsonist Orb\u00e1n, it's three quarters to the right,\u201d said Achim Post, SPD politician.","published_at":1513591288,"content_id":"56aafdc5-6bf5-3f23-9d6e-ab7d53ea60ff","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/austrian-far-sworn-government-amid-132007713.html","content_published_at":1513618160,"content_time":1513618160,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":2,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"7aa2d0be-5cfd-3cd3-872a-35caedeb311a","post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-135cccd5-c431-3564-85d1-3459ddabba2e_a-7aa2d0be-5cfd-3cd3-872a-35caedeb311a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-135cccd5-c431-3564-85d1-3459ddabba2e_a-7aa2d0be-5cfd-3cd3-872a-35caedeb311a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-135cccd5-c431-3564-85d1-3459ddabba2e_a-7aa2d0be-5cfd-3cd3-872a-35caedeb311a","author":"third_watch","provider":"ABC News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/man-allegedly-tries-ram-gate-british-air-force-173003913--abc-news-topstories.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LD5u1JWMn3Z_8APUssvO.Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.go.com\/britain-us-air-force-incident-ap-mem-171218_16x9_992.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x9E5i6VlTFZMr8Ek_xnVgg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTg7dz05OTI7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.go.com\/britain-us-air-force-incident-ap-mem-171218_16x9_992.jpg","height":558,"width":992,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.go.com\/britain-us-air-force-incident-ap-mem-171218_16x9_992.jpg","imgw":992,"imgh":558,"title":"Man allegedly tries to ram gate at British air force base: Police","summary":"A man has been detained after allegedly trying to ram a gate at the perimeter of a British air force base used by the U.S. military, local police said.The Royal Air Force Mildenhall -- a Royal Air Force station the U.S. military uses in Suffolk, England -- was placed on lockdown during the incident.

She had been out in the lively Gemmayzeh neighbourhood of Beirut for the farewell party of a colleague at the British embassy and had left just before midnight with a friend.\u00a0 The\u00a0two then parted ways, leaving Miss Dykes to either walk or take a taxi to her home five minutes away.\u00a0 She had not been drinking as she had an early flight to catch home early the next morning for the Christmas holidays.\u00a0 She was abducted some time after and killed. Her body was found dumped on the Metn highway several miles away.\u00a0 Police sources told the Telegraph the first autopsy revealed the cause of death as strangulation, however a second postmortem examination is to be carried out later.\u00a0 They said they did not believe the attack to be politically motivated. One friend told the Telegraph: \"It's horrific. We had no idea what happened to her until we got a call today to go to the police station to give statements.\" Miss Dykes had been working in Beirut as the programme and policy manager for the Department for International Development since January 2017. Beirut killing She had worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office since 2010, previously on Libya and Iraq.\u00a0 She is thought to have grown up in Hong Kong, but attended Malvern St James Girls boarding school in Worcestershire before later studying anthropology at Manchester University and International Security and Global Governance from Birkbeck, University of London.\u00a0 Friends described her as \"warm\" and \"clever\". \"She was just finding her feet in Beirut, she was just getting to know the city,\" on said.\u00a0 Miss Dykes spoke fluent Mandarin having worked as a teacher in China and Hong Kong for four years prior to joining the\u00a0Foreign Office. In a statement her family said: \"We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Rebecca. We are doing all we can to understand what happened.\" Hugo Shorter, the British ambassador to Lebanon, said: \"The whole embassy is deeply shocked, saddened by this news. My thoughts are with Becky\u2019s family, friends and colleagues for their tragic loss.\u00a0 \"We're providing consular support to her family and working very closely with Lebanese authorities who are conducting police investigation.\" A spokesman for the Department for International Development where she worked said: \"Our thoughts are with Becky's family and friends at this very upsetting time. \"There is now a police investigation and the FCO (Foreign Office) is providing consular support to Becky's family and working with the local authorities.\" Such incidents are rare in Beirut, despite the fragile security situation in the country. Since the end of the country's 15-year civil war in 1990, Lebanon has become more stable.\u00a0 It saw record numbers of tourists this year and attracts increasing numbers of holidaymakers looking to enjoy its Mediterranean beaches and hot climate.\u00a0","published_at":1513529531,"content_id":"7d21ec2c-f611-3fbc-845e-b70af71cf569","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/british-diplomat-found-dead-lebanon-170525954.html","content_published_at":1513530325,"content_time":1513530325,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World

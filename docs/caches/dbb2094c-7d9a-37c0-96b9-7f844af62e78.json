The disclosure, signed by Trump and released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, did not describe the purpose or the recipient of the original 2016 payment to a \"third party\" made by Cohen, for which he was reimbursed by Trump. Rudy Giuliani, who recently became the Republican president's new personal attorney, has said Trump reimbursed Cohen for the original, $130,000 payment, which was made shortly before Trump's victory in the Nov. 8, 2016 presidential election.","published_at":1526493881,"content_id":"e55c8e3b-0fb8-322f-b739-082dd5b66586","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-repaid-attorney-cohen-2016-payment-made-behalf-174124189.html","content_published_at":1526500457,"content_time":1526500457,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Politics","vibe_id":"dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

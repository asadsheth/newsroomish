The beauty of receiving an individual's full undivided attention during a conversation, discussion, debate or even a gossip session is unfortunately continuously being threatened. As more people slip into the addiction of checking their phones every few minutes, and becoming highly proficient in the world of messages and emojis- many are slowly dwindling their human interaction skills at the same time. Dr Tara Wyne, Clinical Psychologist & Clinical Director at Lighthouse Arabia believes that being overly reliant on phone communication and emojis can affect a person's ability to pick up on signals and expressions in a face-to face conversation.","published_at":1523644471,"content_id":"d8fec84a-a199-3204-b001-2df7e8fa824f","content_url":"http:\/\/gulfnews.com\/news\/uae\/society\/how-mobile-phones-are-killing-human-interaction-skills-1.2205044?%2Fhow-mobile-phones-are-killing-human-interaction-skills-1.2205044%3FlocalLinksEnabled=false&%2Fhow-mobile-phones-are-killing-human-interaction-skills-1.2205044%3FlocalLinksEnabled=false&utm_source=Feeds&utm_source=Feeds&utm_source=Feeds&utm_medium=RSS&utm_medium=RSS&utm_medium=RSS&utm_term=News+RSS+feed&utm_term=News+RSS+feed&utm_content=1.2205044&utm_content=1.2205044&utm_campaign=How+mobile+phones+are+killing+human+interaction+skills+&utm_campaign=How&utm_campaign=How+mobile+phones+are+killing+human+interaction+skills+","content_published_at":1523636516,"content_time":1523636516,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":6,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"96808e41-8b33-3f9d-9abe-2eb5c3d73965","post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-f411824e-3ad6-3c33-9392-9a1231c416d7_a-96808e41-8b33-3f9d-9abe-2eb5c3d73965","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-f411824e-3ad6-3c33-9392-9a1231c416d7_a-96808e41-8b33-3f9d-9abe-2eb5c3d73965","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/relationships\/5-research-backed-facts-pubic-3btjgn5","author":"nanook","provider":"Fatherly","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/5-research-backed-facts-pubic-180522132.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OIxPpPOJa91T9B3Miqt4zw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fatherly_721\/a4d5bfb11367ccf6a542cc72f221edc4","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LiVkhdBU7D3YSYOVP5NwmA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NTA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fatherly_721\/a4d5bfb11367ccf6a542cc72f221edc4","height":650,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fatherly_721\/a4d5bfb11367ccf6a542cc72f221edc4","imgw":1200,"imgh":650,"title":"5 Research-Backed Facts About Your Pubic Hair","summary":"Scientists are still not sure why we have pubic hair, but it likely serves a purpose beyond decorating our\u00a0genitals.

And then watched others propose something very similar and vow the audience. Or stopped yourself from sharing your ideas for fear of disapproval or judgment, and wished you could be more like those (men) who can speak fearlessly, and even shrug off criticism as though nothing happened?

The study examined parents' attitudes toward talking about sexual health with their lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer teens (LGBTQ). \"Parents play an important role in helping their children learn how to have healthy sexual relationships, but they really struggle when discussing this with their LGBTQ teens,\" said lead author , an assistant professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. In contrast to heterosexual youth, very little research has previously been conducted on the relationships between LGBTQ youth and their parents, and how parenting can affect children's sexual behaviors.","published_at":1522954285,"content_id":"1aba1a3d-3db9-3fc8-815d-80580ac36f7a","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-04-parents-struggle-discuss-sex-lgbtq.html","content_published_at":1522954976,"content_time":1522954976,"content_relative_time":196,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":196,"comment_relative_time":196,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"85ae15c0-2949-34c6-9e84-2eb60d86d34c","post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-3954f2c1-e857-33d9-9dc4-4784740bf6a1_a-85ae15c0-2949-34c6-9e84-2eb60d86d34c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb_c-3954f2c1-e857-33d9-9dc4-4784740bf6a1_a-85ae15c0-2949-34c6-9e84-2eb60d86d34c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/relationships\/scarlett-johansson-says-fans-hungry-1ral4v8","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Digital Spy","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/scarlett-johansson-says-fans-hungry-124101087.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/G0Z3qSGOPbSpLP_qU3IlOA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/digital_spy_281\/3a60296d0dc133abebf995d7565e3e89","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Un94gVLPIG3acNYvchIvA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02OTE7dz0xNDQwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/digital_spy_281\/3a60296d0dc133abebf995d7565e3e89","height":691,"width":1440,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/digital_spy_281\/3a60296d0dc133abebf995d7565e3e89","imgw":1440,"imgh":691,"title":"Scarlett Johansson says fans are hungry for diversity","summary":"Infinity War star has been advocating for women in the MCU.","published_at":1522932323,"content_id":"85ae15c0-2949-34c6-9e84-2eb60d86d34c","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/scarlett-johansson-says-fans-hungry-124101087.html","content_published_at":1522932061,"content_time":1522932061,"content_relative_time":202,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Relationships","vibe_id":"ce737d28-de97-3252-975e-30a192aaa3bb","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":202,"comment_relative_time":202,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

saying that the special counsel had exceeded his authority by charging Manafort with crimes not related to Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In a 46-page filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Manafort's attorney Kevin Downing said Manafort had been threatened with additional indictments and \"faces a game of criminal-procedure whack-a-mole\" by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, \"whose massive resources he cannot possibly hope to match.\" Under the terms of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's order in May appointing Mueller, the special counsel can probe links or coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly\" from the investigation.","published_at":1521080179,"content_id":"fbf0c522-da12-3455-bd48-e02b31f4bea1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/former-trump-campaign-manager-manafort-files-dismiss-charges-021548636.html","content_published_at":1521082229,"content_time":1521082229,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society

at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s recent crackdown on powerful figures in Saudi Arabia, according to a newspaper report. More than 200 businessmen, princes and government officials were detained in November and imprisoned at the luxury hotel in Riyadh in what the Saudi government said was an anti-corruption drive.\u00a0 According to the New York Times, some of the powerful detainees may have suffered abuse at the hands of their captors as they were coerced into agreements to hand over billions of dollars to the Saudi government in return for their freedom.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia has dismissed the allegations of abuse as \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d.\u00a0 The most dramatic accusation involves Major General Ali al-Qahtani, an aide to a senior Saudi prince seen as a potential rival to the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed, who died in government custody in mid-December.\u00a0 The report was published shortly before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for meetings with the Trump administration Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ Saudi Royal Palace \/ BANDAR AL-JALOUD Sources told the newspaper that the general\u2019s \u201cneck was twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken\u201d and that his body had burn marks which appeared to be the result of electric shocks.\u00a0 General Qahtani was taken to hospital in November but was reportedly returned to his interrogation after being seen by doctors. The government has not offered an official explanation for how he died.\u00a0 The general\u2019s death had been widely reported in Arab and Iranian media previously but not in detail. The US report comes shortly before Prince Mohammed, known by his initials \u201cMBS\u201d, is due in Washington for meetings with the Trump administration.\u00a0 General Qahtani was an aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh who is from a rival line of the Saudi royal family to Prince Mohammed. Prince Turki was himself detained during the November crackdown on allegations of corruption. He was eventually released.

The shooter exchanged fire with police on Friday as police negotiators sought to make contact with him for nearly eight hours. Chris Childs, chief of\u00a0the California Highway Patrol, said the gunman and three women\u00a0were found dead when officers entered the room where the hostages were being held around 6 pm on\u00a0Friday. He said it was \"far too early to say if they were chosen at random\" because investigators had not yet determined a motive. Although authorities called the workers hostages throughout the day Friday, it was unclear how long they were alive held by the gunman. The only shots that were heard at the center happened at around 10:30 a.m., when authorities say the suspect arrived. Throughout the day, authorities said they had been unable to make contact with the gunman and the bodies were found at around 6 p.m. \"This is a tragic piece of news, one we were really hoping we would not have to come before the public to give,\" Childs said. Staff and residents at the sprawling facility in Yountville, a picturesque town located in the heart of Napa Valley's wine country about 60 miles (97 km) north of San Francisco, had been placed under a security lockdown. People walk to the information center at the Veterans Home of California in Yountville Credit: AP The stand-off comes less than a month after a former student with an assault-style rifle killed 17 people at a Florida high school. The massacre touched off a student-led drive for new restrictions on gun ownership to prevent the kind of mass shootings that have become an epidemic in the United States. State Senator Bill Dodd, who represents the area, told reporters that the California gunman was a member of the Pathway Home, a programme for\u00a0veterans\u00a0suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The hostages were believed to be employees who worked with the suspect in the Pathway programme, he said. The\u00a0Veterans\u00a0Home of California, which houses about 1,000 disabled and aging military\u00a0veterans, is the largest facility of its kind in the United States. An armored vehicle arrives at the Veterans Home of California in Yountville Credit: AP An employee who encountered the gunman told her husband, Larry Kamer, by telephone that the three hostages were women, he said. \"She's quite shaken up. She's in a locked-down building,\" Kamer said of his wife, who is development director for the non-profit organisation that runs the home. \u00a0 Hostage negotiators from three different agencies had been trying to make contact with the suspect, the CHP said. \"Gunfire was exchanged. It's not known at this time how many rounds were exchanged,\" CHP spokesman Chris Childs told reporters before the stand off came to an end. A sheriff's hostage negotiation team passes a California highway patrol checkpoint at the Veterans Home of California in Yountville Credit: AP A Napa County sheriff's deputy arrived at the scene within four minutes of the first reports of gunfire and exchanged shots with the suspect, Sheriff John Robertson said. Authorities know the gunman's identity, he said, but were not disclosing his name publicly. A resident of the home, identified as Rod Allen by the CBS television affiliate KPIX, said the gunman took the hostages after allowing some people at a party to leave. He fired about 30 shots, the resident said.","published_at":1520863431,"content_id":"411adc3d-8824-342d-9e95-a43e346b32c7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gunman-three-hostages-dead-eight-040559853.html","content_published_at":1520654759,"content_time":1520654759,"content_relative_time":133,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society

Baroda, the last lender doing business with the firms, maintain operations in the country, court documents showed on Monday. Baroda's South African division was thrust into the spotlight two years ago when it agreed to take on the Guptas after South Africa's major banks turned their back on the family's businesses.

Man Convicted In Death Of Woman Buried Alive","summary":"CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) \u2014 A second man has been convicted in the death of a woman buried alive in a shallow grave in New Jersey 3\u00bd years ago. Jurors in Camden County deliberated for less than an hour Wednesday before convicting 39-year-old Carlos Alicea-Antonetti of first-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery and felony murder. Prosecutors said the jury's finding of special circumstances means the defendant faces a mandatory life term. Alicea-Antonetti and another man were charged in the May 2014 death of 41-year-old Fatima Perez, whose body was found in Monroe Township. An autopsy determined that she died of asphyxiation.

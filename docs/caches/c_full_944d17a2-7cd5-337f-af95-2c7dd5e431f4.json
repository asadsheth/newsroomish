Scientists who studied the wildfire said that nearly a third of the soot landed on Greenland's ice sheet.

Ron Wyden has pushed Congress to address how U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management leaders often must divert money from other programs, including fire prevention and forest management budgets, to cover the increasingly high cost of fighting massive wildfires. Season after season, fire spending consumed an ever-increasing percentage of the federal agencies' relatively flat budgets. Finally, Congress listened and Oregon is likely to benefit. Eventually. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act was a part of the $1.3 trillion federal spending package passed by federal lawmakers and signed by the president late last month.

Chances are you hadn't seen countless previews and TV spots or read a lot of articles prior to seeing a movie, as the information you had to go on was limited and might have only been one trailer or a poster. So selling a movie to audiences was a different exercise, and when something new and original came along, there was a need to explain it to audiences.

Let's face it: World War Z, no matter how much money it made, was a failure. Turning a massively scoped story of the zombie apocalypse, in all of its bloody, violent glory, into a PG-13 summer blockbuster was the first mistake that the 2013 film made. The second mistake was to hand the film to a director like Marc Forster, who, while being able to handle more personal films quite well, isn't exactly the most stable hands to give an action-packed spectacular as World War Z. Which brings us to the film's greatest failing: it failed to bring author Max Brooks' original, episodic vision to life in a way that honored the source material.","published_at":1527640183,"content_id":"6bae70db-91f0-3b79-9121-94e7a819d5ab","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2427111\/its-time-to-pull-the-plug-on-world-war-z-2","content_published_at":1527638341,"content_time":1527638341,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-4076e298-2855-3286-9081-5a3dc6ede260_a-fd98977b-bbbd-3a7e-af09-83ac7c33da86","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-4076e298-2855-3286-9081-5a3dc6ede260_a-fd98977b-bbbd-3a7e-af09-83ac7c33da86","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"POPSUGAR Celebrity","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/celebrity\/How-Did-Sharon-Tate-Die-44016130","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EM5_hIif7EcyWAoWtN4clg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Oqx14N3e5uMWvIEnJgINkQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fd98977b-bbbd-3a7e-af09-83ac7c33da86-1233099687.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Jdkykqrm8YEosG2vrYZicw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Oqx14N3e5uMWvIEnJgINkQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fd98977b-bbbd-3a7e-af09-83ac7c33da86-1233099687.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Oqx14N3e5uMWvIEnJgINkQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fd98977b-bbbd-3a7e-af09-83ac7c33da86-1233099687.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"The Details of Sharon Tate's Gruesome Murder Will Stick With You in the Worst Possible Way","summary":"Actress Sharon Tate was only 26 years old when her life and career were tragically cut short in one of the most brutal murders in Hollywood history.

There are plenty of theories as to why Solo disappointed\u2014crowded release corridor, poor marketing, lackluster reviews\u2014but one apparently has resulted in a lesson learned for Disney. When directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were fired off of Solo and replaced with Ron Howard last summer, almost everyone assumed Disney would push Solo back from its May release date into the December\u00a0arena\u00a0that served as the successful launching pad for the three previous Star Wars films. Instead, Howard admirably got the job done just under the wire, as Disney for some reason felt it was important to meet the Memorial Day Weekend release date.","published_at":1527605048,"content_id":"337e947b-d064-3e29-95ad-005dddd0f039","content_url":"http:\/\/collider.com\/disney-unlikely-to-release-star-wars-movies-so-close-together-after-solo\/","content_published_at":1527585623,"content_time":1527585623,"content_relative_time":37,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-8e43b546-6e45-37a2-bf84-5a10015605bb_a-1360b052-8330-3add-817a-4be3384158c1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/walking-dead-actress-still-wants-1mj7mo5","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ScreenRant","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/batgirl-dceu-katelyn-nacon\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/VHAvKGJq4k7.v7HqD59kZw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nQbsCwTPI4xU1LVV006Vog--\/dz0xOTAwO2g9OTUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1360b052-8330-3add-817a-4be3384158c1--2021487738.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RUg0E3hfzco8x_PpoJWS2g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD05NTA7dz0xOTAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nQbsCwTPI4xU1LVV006Vog--\/dz0xOTAwO2g9OTUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1360b052-8330-3add-817a-4be3384158c1--2021487738.jpeg","height":950,"width":1900,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nQbsCwTPI4xU1LVV006Vog--\/dz0xOTAwO2g9OTUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1360b052-8330-3add-817a-4be3384158c1--2021487738.jpeg","imgw":1900,"imgh":950,"title":"Walking Dead Actress Still Wants to Play the DCEU Batgirl","summary":"The Walking Dead's Katelyn Nacon has once again expressed her fondness for the DC Superhero Batgirl, as well as a desire to play the character on the big screen at some point in the future. The young actress and musician came to television prominence playing Enid on the AMC zombie apocalypse series. A TV-original character, Enid was initially a minor figure on The Walking Dead and played love interest to young Carl Grimes, however more recent episodes have seen her develop deeper relationships with the likes of Maggie and Aaron and Enid has gained more screen time as a result. After Carl's shocking death, Enid could be set to become an even more important character, as showrunners have promised Carl's comic storylines would be played out with other characters.","published_at":1527602239,"content_id":"1360b052-8330-3add-817a-4be3384158c1","content_url":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/batgirl-dceu-katelyn-nacon\/","content_published_at":1527570000,"content_time":1527570000,"content_relative_time":41,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-9932adf4-20f4-3663-80bd-8edae1751f0b_a-5d4ea2cb-ef04-34e4-9a90-2f572ebda40a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/zack-snyder-next-movie-fountainhead-tptv4gv","author":"nanook","provider":"Vulture","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2015-11-30\/6733ce30-977e-11e5-96ac-612aa29c4684_60bc9cfaf2c385aa0ca455932e522781.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/zack-snyder-next-movie-fountainhead-133809948.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cnm36J7Bd.KKOlqiDvcAtA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nymag_com_989\/31235486ef65962f901da86bf6b6b711","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DNFEUoKKhTbdNevXf8nBBA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjAwO3c9MTE0MTs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nymag_com_989\/31235486ef65962f901da86bf6b6b711","height":1600,"width":1141,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nymag_com_989\/31235486ef65962f901da86bf6b6b711","imgw":1141,"imgh":1600,"title":"Zack Snyder\u2019s Next Movie Will Be The Fountainhead","summary":"Snyder will skip his Afghanistan thriller for now.","published_at":1527601391,"content_id":"5d4ea2cb-ef04-34e4-9a90-2f572ebda40a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/zack-snyder-next-movie-fountainhead-133809948.html","content_published_at":1527601089,"content_time":1527601089,"content_relative_time":32,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

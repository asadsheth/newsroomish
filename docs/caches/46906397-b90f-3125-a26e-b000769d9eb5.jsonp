The film has been ridiculed by fans and is commonly considered to be the worst Godzilla movie ever made. One of fans' biggest problems with the movie is that its version of Godzilla barely resembled the King of the Monsters, both in spirit and in appearance. Long before Gareth Edwards and Legendary\u00a0Pictures created the MonsterVerse with 2014's Godzilla, TriStar Pictures tried their hand at an American adaptation of the Japanese classic.

As such, the same questions are circling the long-gestating picture currently referred to as The Batman. Now, you'll likely recall that Joe Manganiello had been cast as Slade Wilson AKA Deathstroke back when Ben Affleck was still attached to direct, but all bets may be off if Matt Reeves sees fit to include someone else as the chief antagonist. As an avid reader of the comics, I think it makes more sense to have Slade working for someone else because, after all, he is a mercenary.

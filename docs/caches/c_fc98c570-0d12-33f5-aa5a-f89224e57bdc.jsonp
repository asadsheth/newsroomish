His account suggests the North Korean leader issued the order at a two-day meeting of senior military leaders and scientists in Pyongyang in mid-December. The defector has not been named, but was described by Japan's Mainichi newspaper, as someone who was involved in the regime's missile programme and has retained links to contacts in the North. He told the newspaper\u00a0the missile will be designated the Unha-4 and will be a larger version of the Unha-3, a three-stage vehicle which North Korea claims is a rocket designed to put satellites into orbit. An Unha-3 was successfully launched from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, in the far north-west of the country, in February 2016. The rocket is believed to have placed a small satellite in orbit, but experts have been unable to detect any transmissions from the satellite. North Korea insists it has the sovereign right to operate rockets and satellites, although the United Nations Security Council has condemned Unha-class rocket launches on the grounds that the vehicles are essentially modified long-range missiles and that the North is using the tests to advance its inter-continental strike capabilities. North Korean state media appears to be readying for a new launch, with the Rodong Sinmun newspaper on December 25 stating in an editorial that: \"Our satellite launch is a legitimate exercise of the right that thoroughly fits the UN Charter that enshrines the basic rights of respect for sovereignty and equality, and the international laws that govern the peaceful use of space.\" North Korea\u2019s nuclear progress - estimated yields per test The new rocket will be larger than the Unha-3, which is about 98 feet long and is based on the Soviet Union's Scud ballistic missile technology. The defector claims that development of the body of the Unha-4 is effectively complete but that scientists will require a further six months to have the new weapon ready to launch.

While North Korea is known to have made significant advances in its intercontinental ballistic missiles, analysts believe that Mr Kim's scientists have still not full mastered shielding a warhead from the intense heat that builds up during re-entry. The reports coincide with the release of a study by the Sejong Institute of South Korea that warns that the North still needs to carry out test launches on a full ICBM trajectory and with a live warhead to demonstrate that it does have an effective nuclear deterrent. \"The North's seventh nuclear test could take place not underground but over the Pacific,\"\u00a0Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst, said in the report.","published_at":1514859316,"content_id":"d03e7c8d-5d87-3f20-a47f-39b2ce90da51","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korean-defector-claims-kim-045236578.html","content_published_at":1514868756,"content_time":1514868756,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":16,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-010e467b-eadf-3047-8c1b-a15293501287_a-2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-010e467b-eadf-3047-8c1b-a15293501287_a-2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-010e467b-eadf-3047-8c1b-a15293501287_a-2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"POPSUGAR Fitness","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/fitness\/Healthy-Sweet-Potatoes-Recipes-44136840","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/chizJ1Jaqt8Tym3FL94xaA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dDSGqTTmHHpSnsTm6Ukv1w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf--701512670.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vBilymB4H5SGrBhlkDBpyg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dDSGqTTmHHpSnsTm6Ukv1w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf--701512670.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dDSGqTTmHHpSnsTm6Ukv1w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2251a29a-303b-324a-b966-c07e3b9531cf--701512670.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"35 Recipes Starring Sweet Potatoes","summary":"Aside from the autumnal orange hue that makes them the perfect ingredient to take center stage at the dinner table, sweet potatoes are loaded with nutritious benefits.

For soft wheat, the EU's most produced cereal, the MARS service cut its forecast for the average yield in the bloc this year to 6.04 tonnes per hectare (t\/ha) from 6.19 t\/ha estimated in May. This is now lower than last year's 6.11 t\/ha yield although 1.2 percent above the average of the past five years, MARS said in a monthly report. It also lowered its outlook for the 2018 barley yield in the EU, to 4.98 t\/ha from 5.04 t\/ha, as a reduced projection for winter barley outweighed an upward revision for spring barley.","published_at":1529333297,"content_id":"8f6b4b94-7115-32a1-af5a-57b72012eb35","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/eu-crop-monitor-cuts-cereal-rapeseed-outlook-harsh-144006389.html","content_published_at":1529332806,"content_time":1529332806,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":2,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c10c8a20-e15c-3165-a248-d337144dccad","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f4c05a9e-6f5d-3d5b-8e69-b2e8400d7a14_a-c10c8a20-e15c-3165-a248-d337144dccad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f4c05a9e-6f5d-3d5b-8e69-b2e8400d7a14_a-c10c8a20-e15c-3165-a248-d337144dccad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/watch-live-trump-attends-meeting-5ywu3ht","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"UPI","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/US\/2018\/06\/18\/Watch-live-Trump-attends-meeting-of-National-Space-Council\/9101529324872\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_ol2QHqnLFjTzG08Wz4JZA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4MIYnp3EPfOKi3sRmjb6Vg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c10c8a20-e15c-3165-a248-d337144dccad--517375728.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1ldEL.Pq8OV4O9PV6xqPBA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTk7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4MIYnp3EPfOKi3sRmjb6Vg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c10c8a20-e15c-3165-a248-d337144dccad--517375728.jpeg","height":399,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4MIYnp3EPfOKi3sRmjb6Vg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c10c8a20-e15c-3165-a248-d337144dccad--517375728.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":399,"title":"Watch live: Trump attends meeting of National Space Council","summary":"June 18 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump for the first time Monday will attend a public meeting of the National Space Council.

The results are consistent with previous beliefs about the age of the fossil, based on genetic evidence. Carbon dating is limited in cases as old as this. This tooth was aged using\u00a0Electron spin resonance. Previously this was used only on large mammals but has more recently been used to age actual human teeth, via a non-destructive procedure.","published_at":1529302858,"content_id":"3437ec27-9522-32d9-b640-95af0e4eaf39","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/au\/news\/europes-oldest-human-fossil-could-be-almost-1-million-years-old\/","content_published_at":1529302332,"content_time":1529302332,"content_relative_time":11,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":11,"comment_relative_time":11,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"80543388-a4ea-3afd-953b-7738b17fc650","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-21d6ed91-cbbc-34a8-87b8-a1a9768273fe_a-80543388-a4ea-3afd-953b-7738b17fc650","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-21d6ed91-cbbc-34a8-87b8-a1a9768273fe_a-80543388-a4ea-3afd-953b-7738b17fc650","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/scientists-respiratory-pathogen-alaska-animals-utpo8mt","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"US News & World Report","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/best-states\/alaska\/articles\/2018-06-18\/scientists-find-respiratory-pathogen-in-alaska-animals","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Scientists Find Respiratory Pathogen in Alaska Animals","summary":"Officials say a respiratory pathogen previously believed to be restricted to sheep and goats has been detected in Alaska moose and caribou.

The OPEC member country's exports to the United States have been hurt by declining oil output and financial sanctions imposed last year by President Donald Trump's administration on the nation and its state-run companies. March volumes represented a 30 percent decline versus the same month a year earlier, but were higher than February's total as imports of the naphtha that Venezuela uses to turn its extra heavy oil into an exportable product have recovered in recent months.","published_at":1523377814,"content_id":"138dce4c-daa9-3ce3-9452-6258d72b34b5","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/venezuelan-crude-sales-united-states-162846591.html","content_published_at":1523377726,"content_time":1523377726,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":19,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-583dc350-b10a-385b-a71c-7c1c5dddcc23_a-79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-583dc350-b10a-385b-a71c-7c1c5dddcc23_a-79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-583dc350-b10a-385b-a71c-7c1c5dddcc23_a-79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/chinas-xi-says-opening-brings-progress-closure-backwardness-024642531--sector.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/z_VMzj3hWzvAqOHybfT58A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-04-10T064354Z_1_LYNXMPEE390DN_RTROPTP_2_USA-TRADE-CHINA.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KYBjOyGwNsHoWcKDUE53pA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDU7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-04-10T064354Z_1_LYNXMPEE390DN_RTROPTP_2_USA-TRADE-CHINA.JPG","height":245,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-04-10T064354Z_1_LYNXMPEE390DN_RTROPTP_2_USA-TRADE-CHINA.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":245,"title":"China's Xi renews vow to open economy, cut tariffs as U.S. trade row deepens","summary":"BOAO\/BEIJING, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping promised on Tuesday to open the country's economy further and lower import tariffs on products like cars, in a speech seen as an attempt to defuse an escalating trade dispute with the United States. While much of his pledges were reiterations of previously announced reforms that foreign businesses say are long overdue, Xi's comments sent stock markets and the U.S. dollar higher on hopes of a compromise that could avert a trade war. Xi said China will widen market access for foreign investors, addressing a chief complaint of its trading partners and a point of contention for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has threatened billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods.","published_at":1523376019,"content_id":"79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/chinas-xi-says-opening-brings-progress-closure-backwardness-024642531--sector.html","content_published_at":1523387135,"content_time":1523387135,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United

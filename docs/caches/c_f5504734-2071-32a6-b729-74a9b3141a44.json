The USS Little Rock was commissioned in Buffalo, N.Y., on Dec. 16 but was trapped by ice at the Port of Montreal less than two weeks into its maiden voyage. A spokeswoman for the Navy said officials decided to wait until weather conditions improved before allowing the ship to continue its journey to Mayport, Fla., out of concern for the safety of the ship and crew. Lt. Cmdr. Courtney Hillson confirmed the ship finally left the city early on Saturday after spending more than three months in Montreal.

A statement on the GoFundMe internet page unveiled earlier on Thursday said the goal was to raise $150,000 from the public but it was raised to $250,000 because of a response that \"has been remarkable and beyond our expectations.\" The action represents an escalation of the battle between McCabe and the administration over his firing amid heavy criticism by President Donald Trump. It also raises the prospect that McCabe could legally challenge his termination in the future.","published_at":1522541431,"content_id":"ede933d7-fba5-3b44-bd3b-d972420524c3","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/ex-fbi-deputy-mccabes-online-legal-defense-fund-015133810.html","content_published_at":1522375839,"content_time":1522375839,"content_relative_time":87,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":87,"comment_relative_time":87,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5ca18775-e426-3e3e-9dda-8f4cce253718","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-a09ba75f-5cca-3501-92e7-d680517c9e7a_a-5ca18775-e426-3e3e-9dda-8f4cce253718","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-a09ba75f-5cca-3501-92e7-d680517c9e7a_a-5ca18775-e426-3e3e-9dda-8f4cce253718","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/analysis-unhappy-states-america-despite-2sdh0of","author":"nanook","provider":"Washington Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/wonkblog\/wp\/2018\/03\/30\/the-unhappy-states-of-america-despite-an-improving-economy-americans-are-glum\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N26uNNwVidIfjV1g7ynCqg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SoE0fjuR1xKfftPgWzQk4Q--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTg5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5ca18775-e426-3e3e-9dda-8f4cce253718--979819599.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_G5GssUfqyhWKSnFCyx3nQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD05ODk7dz0xNDg0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SoE0fjuR1xKfftPgWzQk4Q--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTg5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5ca18775-e426-3e3e-9dda-8f4cce253718--979819599.jpeg","height":989,"width":1484,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SoE0fjuR1xKfftPgWzQk4Q--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTg5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5ca18775-e426-3e3e-9dda-8f4cce253718--979819599.jpeg","imgw":1484,"imgh":989,"title":"Analysis | The unhappy states of America: Despite an improving economy, Americans are glum","summary":"The\u00a0U.S. economy looks pretty good by most measures: Jobs are plentiful, growth is picking up, prices aren't rising too quickly, and unemployment is on track this year to hit the lowest level since 1969.

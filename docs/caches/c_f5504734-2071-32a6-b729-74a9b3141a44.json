For example Litecoin, the Bitcoin-based cryptocoin meant for smaller and faster transactions, has reached a new all-time high of over 300 dollars. The market cap of litecoin has exceeded 16 billion dollars and it is still rising. Ethereum's native token ether has reached a new high of over 750 dollars.

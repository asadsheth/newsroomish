Rocket man: How Kim Jong-un emerged from his father's shadow to silence the doubters However, his comments made clear that the two sides remained far apart on the key issue of what they mean by denuclearisation. Mr Pompeo\u00a0said he had \"good, substantive\" conversations with Mr Kim in Pyongyang in what was his second meeting with the North\u00a0Korea\u00a0leader in less that six weeks, and believed both sides understood the ultimate goal of the summit. \"We had good conversations, substantive conversations. Conversations that involved deep complex problems, challenges; the strategic decision that Chairman Kim has before him about how it is he wishes to proceed and if he is prepared, in exchange for the assurances we are ready to provide to him, if he is prepared to fully denuclearise.\" North\u00a0Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the United States brought exchanges of bellicose rhetoric between Trump and Kim last year that raised fears of a new war on the\u00a0Korean peninsula. In spite of an easing of tensions and a return to dialogue in recent months, North\u00a0Korea\u00a0has given no indication that it is willing to go beyond statements of broad support the for concept of denuclearisation and unilaterally abandon a nuclear weapons programme its ruling family has seen as crucial to its survival. Korean detente How did we get here? North\u00a0Korea's former spy chief Kim Yong Chul, director of the country's United Front Department, boasted in a toast to\u00a0Pompeo\u00a0over lunch in Pyongyang on Wednesday that North\u00a0Korea\u00a0had \"perfected\" its nuclear capability. He said its policy was now \"to concentrate all efforts into economic progress,\" but stressed that this had nothing to do with international sanctions imposed on the country. Mr Pompeo\u00a0said the US\u00a0aim was clear - \"to ensure that North\u00a0Korean doesn\u2019t possess the capacity to threaten, not only the United States but the world, with nuclear weapons.\" He described his conversations with Mr Kim as \"warm\" and said both had tried \"our best to make sure that we were communicating clearly and had shared understanding about what our mutual objectives were.\" \"We had good conversations about the histories of our two nations,\" he added.\"We talked about the fact that America has often in history had adversaries who we are now close partners with and our hope that we can achieve the same with respect to North\u00a0Korea.\" Profile | Mike Pompeo Mr Pompeo\u00a0said the complete denuclearization of the\u00a0Korean peninsula would require a robust verification\" programme by the United States and other countries. South\u00a0Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha stressed that sanctions against Pyongyang would not be lifted until it had taken concrete steps to denuclearise. \"We very much hope to see further steps, more concrete steps toward denuclearisation at the US-North\u00a0Korea\u00a0summit, so we're not talking about sanctions relief at this point,\" she said. On Thursday, US\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence praised Kim Jong-un for making moves toward peace, but expressed caution. \"What Kim Jong-un has said publicly and in discussions is that he is prepared to negotiate to achieve complete denuclearization of the\u00a0Korean Peninsula,\" he said. \"Those words are important, but we'll see what they mean.\"\u00a0","published_at":1526096439,"content_id":"b69d2305-51af-30a1-a0e1-cd6ab0a819b9","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mike-pompeo-promises-north-korea-035622053.html","content_published_at":1526097382,"content_time":1526097382,"content_relative_time":61,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":61,"comment_relative_time":61,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5d09d2d2-fcdd-3f43-b565-20bc44a71afb","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-706aa8b1-e7c5-3436-9ec8-54f573f6a56f_a-5d09d2d2-fcdd-3f43-b565-20bc44a71afb","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-706aa8b1-e7c5-3436-9ec8-54f573f6a56f_a-5d09d2d2-fcdd-3f43-b565-20bc44a71afb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-706aa8b1-e7c5-3436-9ec8-54f573f6a56f_a-5d09d2d2-fcdd-3f43-b565-20bc44a71afb","author":"third_watch","provider":"Yahoo News Video","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news","provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/former-vp-dick-cheney-says-210819630.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2DfAYiTu17_cSMI3_9Arcg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-167978-1526072478106.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vwIGTAoh0eeVIKR3kbPHIg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjgwO3c9NzIwOw--\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-167978-1526072478106.jpg","height":1280,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-167978-1526072478106.jpg","imgw":720,"imgh":1280,"title":"Former VP Dick Cheney says U.S. should not have ended harsh interrogations","summary":null,"published_at":1526073051,"content_id":"5d09d2d2-fcdd-3f43-b565-20bc44a71afb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/former-vp-dick-cheney-says-210819630.html","content_published_at":1526072899,"content_time":1526072899,"content_relative_time":67,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"video_link","aspect":0.560000000000000053290705182007513940334320068359375},"created_at":0,"comment_time":67,"comment_relative_time":67,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"091801b1-2efc-30e6-a280-97d99fa38f63","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-619b49b0-65c8-39a1-8ccc-36ff4cf786c5_a-091801b1-2efc-30e6-a280-97d99fa38f63","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-619b49b0-65c8-39a1-8ccc-36ff4cf786c5_a-091801b1-2efc-30e6-a280-97d99fa38f63","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-619b49b0-65c8-39a1-8ccc-36ff4cf786c5_a-091801b1-2efc-30e6-a280-97d99fa38f63","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Reuters","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/21\/reuters-85x27_113626.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/column-commentary-trump-iran-nuclear-220821541.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"COLUMN-Commentary: Trump\u2019s Iran nuclear decision ends era in U.S.-Europe ties","summary":"Does Europe still have a partner, a big brother across the water?

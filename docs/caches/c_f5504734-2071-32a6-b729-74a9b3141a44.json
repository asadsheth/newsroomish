March volumes represented a 30 percent decline versus the same month a year earlier, but were higher than February's total as imports of the naphtha that Venezuela uses to turn its extra heavy oil into an exportable product have recovered in recent months.","published_at":1523377814,"content_id":"138dce4c-daa9-3ce3-9452-6258d72b34b5","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/venezuelan-crude-sales-united-states-162846591.html","content_published_at":1523377726,"content_time":1523377726,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-583dc350-b10a-385b-a71c-7c1c5dddcc23_a-79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-583dc350-b10a-385b-a71c-7c1c5dddcc23_a-79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-583dc350-b10a-385b-a71c-7c1c5dddcc23_a-79adcdfa-8b73-39fd-932e-c6fd9a1bcfbc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/chinas-xi-says-opening-brings-progress-closure-backwardness-024642531--sector.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/z_VMzj3hWzvAqOHybfT58A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-04-10T064354Z_1_LYNXMPEE390DN_RTROPTP_2_USA-TRADE-CHINA.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KYBjOyGwNsHoWcKDUE53pA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDU7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-04-10T064354Z_1_LYNXMPEE390DN_RTROPTP_2_USA-TRADE-CHINA.JPG","height":245,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-04-10T064354Z_1_LYNXMPEE390DN_RTROPTP_2_USA-TRADE-CHINA.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":245,"title":"China's Xi renews vow to open economy, cut tariffs as U.S. trade row deepens","summary":"BOAO\/BEIJING, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping promised on Tuesday to open the country's economy further and lower import tariffs on products like cars, in a speech seen as an attempt to defuse an escalating trade dispute with the United States.

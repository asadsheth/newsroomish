While Galileo kept his observation secret for years to follow because of the Catholic Church at the time, his documentation of Io paved the way for some very strange findings concerning this moon in subsequent centuries. Referred to as Jupiter's \u201cpizza moon\u201d due to its bright and blotted landscape, Io has also been regarded as a moon of fire and ice since it resides in an utterly cold place in our solar system (nearly 400 million miles from the Sun), but, unlike Jupiter's other moons, it emits massive amounts of heat despite its small

The Falcon 9 rocket, launched in August 2017, generated huge circular shock waves and slashed a 559-mile (900km) hole in the ionosphere that lasted for three hours. The record-setting puncture was akin to a localised magnetic storm and may have caused disruptions to GPS systems on Earth, experts said. Shock waves created by the event stretched 1,099,827 square miles (1,770,000 square kilometers) or four times the area of California, the report found.

NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold, along with cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev, successfully boarded the space station after a roughly two-day trip from Earth. The crew launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, located in Kazakhstan and took the trip in a Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft which has become the default mode of transportation for ISS travelers. The new members, which will spend over five months aboard the spacecraft, join NASA astronaut Scott Tingle, Roscosmos cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, and Norishige Kanai of Japan's space agency, JAXA, as the full six-member team for Expedition 55. The lengthy trip between Earth an the International Space Station has less to do with distance and more to do with the careful maneuvering required for the crew capsule to successfully dock with the orbiting laboratory. Now that their journey is over, the scientists can get down to work, and there's plenty of it to go around. According to NASA, the crew has roughly 250 experiments and investigations to conduct during their stay aboard the ISS. They'll be dabbling in \"biology, Earth science, human research, physical sciences and technology development,\" NASA says. \"Highlights of upcoming investigations include:\u00a0a new facility\u00a0to test materials, coatings and components of other large experiments in the harsh environment of space,\" NASA explains. \"A study on the effects of microgravity on\u00a0bone marrow\u00a0and blood cells produced in bone marrow; and a newly-developed passive\u00a0nutrient delivery system\u00a0for the\u00a0Veggie\u00a0plant growth facility.\" Much of the work being performed on the International Space Station is forward-looking, and new discoveries can and will be applied to future space missions, including proposed journeys to Mars. More specifically, research into the effects of long-term stays in space will have a huge impact on how NASA and other space agencies around the world plan for manned missions to other planets. Recently, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and his twin brother, Mark, were the subject of the \"Twins Experiment\" which sought to determine how space can alter the genes of individuals during long trips. Despite some confusion on the topic, NASA revealed that the expression of Scott's genes had indeed undergone a long-lasting change, which could be a vital area of research going forward.","published_at":1522084890,"content_id":"280c0f55-34a7-3c25-95e3-8d68090e4758","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/international-space-station-gets-three-residents-expedition-55-183443114.html","content_published_at":1522089283,"content_time":1522089283,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"285f39c9-e502-34f0-9787-4fc424acacef","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-546b90dd-03cd-35ac-bfb2-068788b0429e_a-285f39c9-e502-34f0-9787-4fc424acacef","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-546b90dd-03cd-35ac-bfb2-068788b0429e_a-285f39c9-e502-34f0-9787-4fc424acacef","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/astronauts-bring-unique-perspective-one-50c1wre","author":"third_watch","provider":"Lansing State Journal","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.lansingstatejournal.com\/story\/entertainment\/television\/2018\/03\/26\/astronauts-bring-unique-perspective-one-strange-rock\/33204295\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eqnBcjhB8_yA_4HESOFWcw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Wc0FpnC0SIeUkZOZP9vikA--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_285f39c9-e502-34f0-9787-4fc424acacef--1235609309.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/361NuNt7GVtGxJl8RNUuig--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Wc0FpnC0SIeUkZOZP9vikA--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_285f39c9-e502-34f0-9787-4fc424acacef--1235609309.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Wc0FpnC0SIeUkZOZP9vikA--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_285f39c9-e502-34f0-9787-4fc424acacef--1235609309.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"Astronauts bring unique perspective to 'One Strange Rock'","summary":"It's tough enough to float in space, tethered to a ship.

In conjunction with the space agency Sitael, the test was conducted in a vacuum chamber in Italy to simulate an altitude of approximately 125 miles. \u201cThis project","published_at":1522015591,"content_id":"b6782387-3e28-3694-bda9-3cb0ce88ff53","content_url":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/cool-tech\/esa-tests-air-fueled-ion-engine\/","content_published_at":1522014867,"content_time":1522014867,"content_relative_time":44,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":44,"comment_relative_time":44,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"71a9a10c-b857-3918-819f-7db9dc521a4e","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-ac50b90c-e357-3ddd-b1f6-18de3d8153a6_a-71a9a10c-b857-3918-819f-7db9dc521a4e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-ac50b90c-e357-3ddd-b1f6-18de3d8153a6_a-71a9a10c-b857-3918-819f-7db9dc521a4e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/starwatch-blue-moon-virgo-5fogeek","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"the Guardian","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2018\/mar\/25\/starwatch-a-blue-moon-in-virgo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hKINUH2uYZf8W7Ll5bR0Gg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ly.yHTPRr1z4Uzf2daF5nA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_71a9a10c-b857-3918-819f-7db9dc521a4e-260314460.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Du1LhfyQPnKBTZQfW1avJA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ly.yHTPRr1z4Uzf2daF5nA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_71a9a10c-b857-3918-819f-7db9dc521a4e-260314460.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ly.yHTPRr1z4Uzf2daF5nA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_71a9a10c-b857-3918-819f-7db9dc521a4e-260314460.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Starwatch: a blue moon in Virgo","summary":"The second full moon of the month can aid starwatchers to identify the faint constellation of Virgo Sun 25 Mar 2018 16.30\u00a0EDT Last modified on Sun 25 Mar 2018 17.00\u00a0EDT The month ends this week with a blue moon.

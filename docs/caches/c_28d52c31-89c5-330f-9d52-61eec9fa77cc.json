Scientists released the picture Thursday in advance of next week's milestone. Resembling a vivid watercolor painting, the photo captures an immense, blindingly bright star emerging from its cosmic nest in a burst of ultraviolet radiation and stellar wind. This star, Herschel 36, is located in the Lagoon Nebula 4,000 light-years away. The star is 32 times more massive than our sun. Hubble flew into orbit April 24, 1990, aboard space shuttle Discovery. The telescope has scrutinized more than 43,500 celestial objects and racked up more than 1.5 million observations.","published_at":1524237655,"content_id":"c144b17b-e17a-30ab-8b97-b58095c24bd0","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/04\/20\/hubble-celebrates-28-years-with-shot-of-wild-stellar-nursery\/","content_published_at":1524237879,"content_time":1524237879,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":5,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8934db18-eff9-36dc-b994-ddfca69e55a8","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-b2b60c27-b66f-3ef5-ae23-4ec5191ad794_a-8934db18-eff9-36dc-b994-ddfca69e55a8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-b2b60c27-b66f-3ef5-ae23-4ec5191ad794_a-8934db18-eff9-36dc-b994-ddfca69e55a8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/europes-mars-rover-takes-shape-2gx2n17","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"BBC","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-43832868","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nMIQtEV6_.yB9n7Poy8nRA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zFgNrhfR8yteG1hBDIar4w--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8934db18-eff9-36dc-b994-ddfca69e55a8-1235241006.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hf0seurF7w96QWoszTOK2g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zFgNrhfR8yteG1hBDIar4w--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8934db18-eff9-36dc-b994-ddfca69e55a8-1235241006.jpeg","height":576,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zFgNrhfR8yteG1hBDIar4w--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8934db18-eff9-36dc-b994-ddfca69e55a8-1235241006.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":576,"title":"Europe's Mars rover takes shape","summary":"So, here it is.

Designed to create the best-ever three-dimensional map of our galaxy, Gaia is poised to deepen our appreciation not only of the Milky Way but also of its most mysterious denizens: brown dwarfs, strange objects that lie uncomfortably between astronomers' standard definitions of stars and gas-giant planets. By more precisely mapping the movements of more than a billion stars as they travel through the galaxy, the Gaia telescope will allow astronomers to tease out the presence of the stars' smaller, dimmer companions that cannot yet be directly seen. Eventually, the mission should yield millions of these nonstellar objects around the stars it surveys\u2014and help determine if they should be classified as brown dwarfs or planets.","published_at":1524223937,"content_id":"e6388497-b577-3ef9-923e-214cb67de007","content_url":"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/its-full-of-stars-new-3-d-milky-way-map-could-settle-debate-over-who-discovered-the-first-exoplanet\/","content_published_at":1524200400,"content_time":1524200400,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fd41fee8-60bd-3a3f-b965-3cb3095a460e","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-1853bf5d-0792-33a9-bc08-25a7fc8d3652_a-fd41fee8-60bd-3a3f-b965-3cb3095a460e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-1853bf5d-0792-33a9-bc08-25a7fc8d3652_a-fd41fee8-60bd-3a3f-b965-3cb3095a460e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/look-sky-friday-cmc-sky-5mr486u","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"steamboattoday.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.steamboattoday.com\/news\/look-to-the-sky-friday-with-cmc-sky-club\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Look to the sky Friday with CMC Sky Club","summary":"STEAMBOAT SPRINGS \u2013 Spectroscopy is often considered the \"bread and butter\" of astronomy. \"It's the science of measuring the different colors of light that come from an object and using that information to deduce lots of information about the object,\" said Paul McCudden, astronomy professor at Colorado Mountain College Steamboat Springs. \u201cIn the case of stars, for example, how far away they are, what they're made of, how hot they are, how old they are and many other things.\" To help unravel the secrets of stars, CMC's Sky Club will host \"Reading Rainbows: Student Spectroscopy,\" a stargazing and guided sky tour event at 7 p.m. Friday at CMC's Albright Family Auditorium. \"If the skies are clear,","published_at":1524240919,"content_id":"fd41fee8-60bd-3a3f-b965-3cb3095a460e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.steamboattoday.com\/news\/look-to-the-sky-friday-with-cmc-sky-club\/","content_published_at":1524200400,"content_time":1524200400,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6da18b95-2d2d-3b56-aa60-046161339914","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-75a36be8-36aa-3f4c-a80b-7738c0ec8a5d_a-6da18b95-2d2d-3b56-aa60-046161339914","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-75a36be8-36aa-3f4c-a80b-7738c0ec8a5d_a-6da18b95-2d2d-3b56-aa60-046161339914","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-75a36be8-36aa-3f4c-a80b-7738c0ec8a5d_a-6da18b95-2d2d-3b56-aa60-046161339914","author":"third_watch","provider":"WFTX","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.fox4now.com\/news\/national\/look-up-annual-lyrid-meteor-shower-peaks-this-weekend","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Look up: Annual Lyrid meteor shower peaks this weekend","summary":"DENVER \u2013 If your weekend plans don't involve stargazing, you might consider changing that.

Theorists are constantly exploring other options; individual galaxies and their satellites arguably favor some modification of gravity to dark matter; there are big controversies over just how fast the Universe is expanding, and the conclusions we've drawn from supernova data may need to be altered. Given that we've made mistaken assumptions in the past by presuming that the unseen Universe contained substances that simply weren't there, from the aether to phlogiston, isn't it a greater leap-of-faith to assume that 95% of the Universe is some invisible, unseen form of energy than it is to assume there's just a flaw in the law of gravity? The answer is a resounding, absolute no, according to almost all astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists who study the Universe.","published_at":1524063939,"content_id":"d008d400-ca2b-3e49-b5e6-40d76a9cdc92","content_url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/starts-with-a-bang\/what-astronomers-wish-everyone-knew-about-dark-matter-and-dark-energy-d13eada60ea0","content_published_at":1523973661,"content_time":1523973661,"content_relative_time":78,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":78,"comment_relative_time":78,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-f1adc60f-b58e-3887-a873-0f39c68efeb7_a-efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-f1adc60f-b58e-3887-a873-0f39c68efeb7_a-efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-f1adc60f-b58e-3887-a873-0f39c68efeb7_a-efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNBC","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/2018\/04\/17\/ross-creating-a-one-stop-shop-for-space-at-the-commerce-department.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TwG4LAIBeowJPtlbSqGxTQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SdsOCB8fkDdgMAFvj13WSA--\/dz0xOTEwO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a--1577818315.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nFcWWiV7HsA_NK8sLkw6Xg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDAwO3c9MTkxMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SdsOCB8fkDdgMAFvj13WSA--\/dz0xOTEwO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a--1577818315.jpeg","height":1000,"width":1910,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SdsOCB8fkDdgMAFvj13WSA--\/dz0xOTEwO2g9MTAwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_efd1950b-9f40-3ee1-865a-f19eaff7f28a--1577818315.jpeg","imgw":1910,"imgh":1000,"title":"Secretary Wilbur Ross: Creating a 'one-stop shop for space' at the Commerce Department","summary":"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced more details Tuesday about how his department will become \"a one-stop shop\" for regulating the burgeoning space industry.

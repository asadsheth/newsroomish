We see time travel in plenty of movies, such as the Terminator and Back to the Future franchises. There are even those among us who believe certain people to be time travelers. As of today, we have no proof that there are, in fact, time travelers among us. All the time travelers we know are from the silver screen. What we do have today are theories about how time travel may be possible and how it would work. 10 Einstein's Theory Of General Relativity The first theory on this list is Einstein's theory of general relativity.[1] This theory helped physicists theorize about how time travel could exist.

In honor of the occasion here are five facts about the space shuttle you might not know: In orbit, the space shuttle's top speed was 17,500 miles per hour. At that speed, the astronauts saw a sunset or sunrise about once every 45 minutes. During the total of the shuttle program, which went from 1981 to 2011, the combined mileage of all five orbiters was 513.7 million miles. The space shuttle contained 30,000 heat shielding tiles that were made essentially out of sand.

In addition to being the closest extra-solar planet to our Solar System, this terrestrial planet also orbits within Proxima Centauri's circumstellar habitable zone (aka. \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d). As a result, scientists have naturally sought to determine if this planet could actually be home to extra-terrestial life.

These were not patches of snow and ice, but rather plumes of smoke from the island's biggest wildfire\u00a0on record, burning through miles of thawed peatland. Black carbon particles from smoke plumes can darken Greenland's vast ice sheet, contributing to more heat absorption and more melting. Scientists who studied the wildfire said that nearly a third of the soot landed on Greenland's ice sheet. They warned that much bigger blazes could move through the icy island in the future, and the emissions from these fires could contribute to further melting of the already thinning ice sheet. \"I think it's a warning sign","published_at":1523619270,"content_id":"6fbe9b23-e1bf-38a4-8e9b-9080654f4a0e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/62297-greenland-biggest-wildfire-warning-sign.html","content_published_at":1523617800,"content_time":1523617800,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1fc52520-b493-323d-b732-b2f8874b8b27","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-6465ab71-2c36-31db-8bec-c79872acf2fd_a-1fc52520-b493-323d-b732-b2f8874b8b27","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-6465ab71-2c36-31db-8bec-c79872acf2fd_a-1fc52520-b493-323d-b732-b2f8874b8b27","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-6465ab71-2c36-31db-8bec-c79872acf2fd_a-1fc52520-b493-323d-b732-b2f8874b8b27","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Fox News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/04\/13\/wildfires-burn-homes-force-evacuations-in-oklahoma.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fnational+%28Internal+-+US+Latest+-+Text%29","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JSjT.k22A7uFs000wMowHQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z0V.oHMRXURfUNwcsX1dug--\/dz02MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_59c7d946-0718-3342-aa39-16e7cff817be--2128080025.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QU8AsIrQ2UFX4324m9iRcA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MDA7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z0V.oHMRXURfUNwcsX1dug--\/dz02MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_59c7d946-0718-3342-aa39-16e7cff817be--2128080025.jpeg","height":600,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z0V.oHMRXURfUNwcsX1dug--\/dz02MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_59c7d946-0718-3342-aa39-16e7cff817be--2128080025.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":600,"title":"Hunter burned, homes evacuated in Oklahoma wildfires","summary":"OKLAHOMA CITY \u2013 \u00a0An Oklahoma turkey hunter was found alive but badly burned Friday after spending the night trapped by one of two wildfires raging in northwestern Oklahoma that forced about 1,400 people from their homes. The fire that trapped the hunter began Thursday afternoon near Leedey, about 110 miles (177 kilometers) northwest of Oklahoma City and has burned about 82,000 acres (331 sq. kilometers), Oklahoma Forestry Services spokeswoman Michelle Finch-Walker said. Three hunters were trapped, but two were rescued. The man who was burned was hospitalized in serious condition, Finch-Walker said.

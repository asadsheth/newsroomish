The Altoona Mirror reports that about 50 volunteer firefighters responded to the scene Saturday after a transformer malfunction ignited a fire in a wooded area in Logan Township near Altoona. The state forestry department also responded, arranging for a helicopter to help douse the flames. District Chief Tony Tanzi says the steep ground and gusty wind complicated the battle for firefighters.

Scientists who studied the wildfire said that nearly a third of the soot landed on Greenland's ice sheet.

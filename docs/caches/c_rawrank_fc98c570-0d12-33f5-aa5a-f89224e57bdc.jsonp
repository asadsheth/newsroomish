Eli Whitney created the mechanical cotton gin in 1793, which sparked a revolution in the ability to process cotton. His development of interchangeable parts for manufacturing revolutionized productivity in factories. Robert Fulton launched the first commercially successful steamboat that brought passengers from New York City to Albany in 1807.

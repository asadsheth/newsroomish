The coins were discovered by Hebrew University archaeologist Dr. Eilat Mazar during excavations below the Temple Mount's southern Wall. The coins were left behind by people hiding in a large cave between 66 A.D. and 70 A.D. The tumultuous four-year period spanned the Roman siege of Jerusalem to the destruction of the Second Temple and the city. \u201cWhile several of the coins date to the early years of the revolt, the great majority are from its final year, otherwise known as, 'Year Four' (69-70 CE),\u201d explained Hebrew University, in a statement.","published_at":1522869710,"content_id":"f912c4f4-295f-3cfa-b9ce-9e1dbfcfd999","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/2018\/04\/04\/trove-ancient-freedom-coins-unearthed-in-jerusalem.html","content_published_at":1522867500,"content_time":1522867500,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":21,"comment_relative_time":21,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"38aea0ab-ad8a-3c3f-a63c-0288cab94c14","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-7d2d027f-cc5a-3834-b580-2ccaf211ce41_a-38aea0ab-ad8a-3c3f-a63c-0288cab94c14","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-7d2d027f-cc5a-3834-b580-2ccaf211ce41_a-38aea0ab-ad8a-3c3f-a63c-0288cab94c14","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/second-big-bang-could-end-42pchep","author":"nanook","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/big-bang-could-end-the-universe-could-end-with-unstable-higgs-boson-2018-4?amp%3Butm_medium=referral","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EJIb_MryWTxL0JxFvHC6pA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sQy_KyO_iyIQRhx6iIY0Yg--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_38aea0ab-ad8a-3c3f-a63c-0288cab94c14--1172570062.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/smGPy5jPUQziJ8Y8f4VzHA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sQy_KyO_iyIQRhx6iIY0Yg--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_38aea0ab-ad8a-3c3f-a63c-0288cab94c14--1172570062.jpeg","height":375,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sQy_KyO_iyIQRhx6iIY0Yg--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_38aea0ab-ad8a-3c3f-a63c-0288cab94c14--1172570062.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":375,"title":"A second 'Big Bang' could end our universe in an instant \u2014 and it's all because of a tiny particle that controls the laws of physics","summary":"Physicists found that our universe will likely end the way it began, with a second 'Big Bang.'

Now, a recent study finally sheds light on how some birds visually see Earth's magnetic field. Birds use Earth's magnetic field as sort of a heads-up display to help them navigate the globe. The Earth's magnetic field is a result of the movement or convection of liquid iron in the outer core. As the liquid metal in the outer core moves, it generates electric currents, which lead to a magnetic field. The continual movement of liquid metal through this magnetic field creates stronger electrical currents and thus a stronger magnetic field.

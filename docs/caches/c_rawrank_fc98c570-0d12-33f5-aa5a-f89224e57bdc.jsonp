Even so, Star Trek has been a big part of my life -- enough so that when I heard that Dr. Ethan Siegel, a Lewis & Clark College astrophysics professor, had just published\u00a0Treknology,\u00a0a book on Star Trek technology, I jumped at the chance to grab a copy.

The finding, published Thursday in Science, represents the first detection of naturally occurring ice-VII ever found on Earth. And as sometimes happens in the scientific process, it was discovered entirely by accident.

The bad news is that, according to the concerned authors, it\u00a0highlights a new vulnerability that could arise in a severely disrupted climate system \u2014 and becomes a real possibility if rampant global warming continues well beyond this century. The study finds that in a future world of extreme warming, after Antarctic sea ice collapses and oceans are altered, large volumes of essential nutrients could become trapped in the Southern Ocean. This would occur because the Southern Ocean near Antarctica is a key site of \u201cupwelling,\u201d in which deep ocean waters, which have picked up such nutrients as phosphorous and nitrogen from the\u00a0depths (which end up there after marine organisms die and their bodies sink), rise and deliver that biological bounty to the surface.","published_at":1520623971,"content_id":"0e168221-93f8-38e2-b2d6-493f30b47a3d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/energy-environment\/wp\/2018\/03\/09\/this-dire-ocean-scenario-is-a-stark-reminder-of-why-the-world-is-trying-to-stop-climate-change\/","content_published_at":1520578680,"content_time":1520578680,"content_relative_time":81,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":81,"comment_relative_time":81,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ccb12f3d-3eb2-33f0-b216-730e8e392789","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e3edf8c3-a3f5-3ece-a029-2a35d3b87c71_a-ccb12f3d-3eb2-33f0-b216-730e8e392789","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-e3edf8c3-a3f5-3ece-a029-2a35d3b87c71_a-ccb12f3d-3eb2-33f0-b216-730e8e392789","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/nasa-says-fireball-shook-washington-5btlqq9","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"KCPQ -

The last blue moon was a spectacular sight, dubbed the\u00a0'super blue blood moon'.\u00a0Falling on January 31, it was the product of three different phenomena: it was a supermoon, a blue moon and a blood moon. While many said it was the first to be seen in 152 years, other contested the fact, leading to a division among scientists. Although there was no full moon in February, stargazers are in for a treat in March: as well as the first full moon on the night of March 1, we will see another full moon on March 31. As it is the second full moon of the month, it will be a blue moon\u00a0\u2013 the second of 2018. The moon is the largest and brightest object in our night sky and has enchanted and\u00a0inspired mankind for centuries. Blue moons\u00a0are a rare breed, but full moons can be admired every month.\u00a0Here is everything you need to know about Earth's only natural satellite, from all its different names to how it was formed. Super blue blood moon, in pictures How often does a full moon occur? Afull moon occurs every 29.5 days and is when the Moon is completely illuminated by the Sun's rays. It occurs when Earth is directly aligned\u00a0between the Sun and the Moon.\u00a0 Why do full moons have names? The early Native Americans didn't record time using months of the Julian or Gregorian calendar. Instead tribes\u00a0gave\u00a0each full moon a nickname to keep track of the seasons and lunar months. Most of the names relate to an activity or an event that took place at the time in each\u00a0location.\u00a0However, it\u00a0wasn't a uniform system and tribes\u00a0tended to name and count moons differently. Some, for example, counted four seasons a year\u00a0while others counted five. Others defined a year as 12 moons, while others said there were\u00a013. Colonial Americans adopted some of the moon names and applied them to their own calendar system which is why they're still in existence today, according to the Farmer\u2019s Almanac. January: Wolf Moon This moon was named because villagers used to hear packs of wolves howling in hunger around this time of the year.\u00a0Its other name is the Old Moon. This January there are\u00a0two Wolf Moons - and stargazers will be in for a treat as both will be supermoons. When two moons occur in one month, the second is called a blue moon. While blue moons typically occur\u00a0only once every two to three years, this year we will be treated to two moons - the second appearing at the end of March. The night following the first full moon of the month saw the Quadrantid meteor shower light up the skies. When? January 2 and January 31 February:\u00a0Snow Moon Snow moon is named after the white stuff because historically it's always been the snowiest month in America. It's also traditionally\u00a0referred to as the Hunger Moon, because hunting was very difficult in snowy conditions.\u00a0 However this year there won't be a Snow Moon - with a full moon occurring at the end of January and another at the beginning of March, we won't see one light up the skies during the year's shortest month. When?\u00a0There will be no full moon this month The full Snow Moon appears red above London's Albert bridge and Battersea Bridge in 2012 Credit: Anthony Devlin March: Worm Moon As temperatures warm, earthworm casts begin to appear and birds begin finding food. It's also known as\u00a0Sap Moon, Crow Moon and Lenten Moon. There will be two moons this March, one at the start of the month and one at the end. As in January, the second moon of the month is called a blue moon. The second\u00a0moon of the month is important because it is used to fix the date of Easter, which is always the Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox.\u00a0This year, that moon\u00a0appears on Saturday March 31, which means Easter Sunday falls the day after, on April 1. When? March 1\u00a0and 31 April:\u00a0Pink Moon April's full moon is known as the Pink Moon, but don't be fooled into thinking it will turn pink. It's actually named after pink wildflowers, which appear\u00a0in the US and Canada in early spring.\u00a0 This moon is also known as Egg Moon, due to spring egg-laying season. Some coastal tribes referred\u00a0to it as Fish Moon because it appeared at the same time as the shad swimming upstream.\u00a0 When? April 30 May: Flower Moon Spring has officially sprung by the time\u00a0May arrives, and flowers and colourful blooms dot the landscape. This moon is also known as\u00a0Corn Planting Moon, as crops are sown in time for harvest, or Bright Moon because this full moon is known to be one of the brightest.\u00a0Some people refer to it as Milk Moon. When? \u00a0May 29 June: Strawberry Moon This moon is named after the\u00a0beginning of the strawberry picking season.\u00a0It's other names are Rose Moon, Hot Moon, or Hay Moon as hay is typically harvested around now. This moon appears in the same month as\u00a0the summer solstice, the longest day of the year (June 21)\u00a0in which we\u00a0can enjoy\u00a0approximately 17 hours of daylight. When? June 28 The so-called 'Strawberry Moon' rises behind Glastonbury Tor on in June 2016.\u00a0 Credit: Matt Cardy\/Getty Images July: Thunder Moon Named due to the prevalence of summer thunder storms. It's sometimes referred to as the Full Buck Moon because at this time of the year\u00a0a buck's antlers are fully grown.\u00a0 When? July 27 August: Sturgeon Moon Tribes in North America typically caught Sturgeon during this month, but also it is when grain and corn were gathered so is also referred to as Grain Moon.\u00a0 This moon appears in the same month as the Perseid\u00a0meteor shower. When? August 26 September:\u00a0Harvest Moon The Harvest Moon is the name given to the first full moon that takes place closest to the Autumn equinox, which this year will come on September 23. The Harvest Moon arrived\u00a0late last year, on October 5\u00a0- it normally rises in September. It was during September that most of the crops were harvested ahead of the autumn and this moon would give light to farmers so they could carry on working longer in the evening. Some tribes also called it the Barley Moon, the Full Corn Moon\u00a0or Fruit Moon.\u00a0 When? September 25 October: Hunter's Moon As people planned ahead for the cold months ahead, the October moon came to signify the ideal time for hunting game, which were becoming fatter from eating falling grains. This moon is also\u00a0known as the travel moon and the dying grass moon. When? October 24 November: Frost\u00a0Moon The first of the winter frosts historically begin to take their toll around now and winter begins to bite, leading to this month's moon moniker. It is\u00a0also known as the Beaver Moon. When?November 23 December: Cold Moon Nights are long and dark and winter's grip tightens, hence this Moon's name. With Christmas just a few weeks away, it's also referred to as Moon before Yule\u00a0and Long Nights Moon. When? December 22 Clouds clear to allow a view of the final full moon of the year, a so-called 'Cold Moon' on December 13 2016 in Cornwall.

We use it to refer to something happening\u00a0very rarely and a blue moon is a rare occurrence. It's the name\u00a0given to a\u00a0second full moon that occurs in a single calendar month and this\u00a0typically occurs only once every two to three years. There's lots of other moons, too: Full moon:\u00a0We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the night at night. Harvest moon: The\u00a0full moon closest to the autumn equinox. Black moon:\u00a0Most experts agree that this\u00a0refers to the second new moon in a calendar month.\u00a0The last black moon was at the start of October 2016 and the\u00a0next one\u00a0is expected in 2019. Blue moon:\u00a0A phenomenon that occurs when there is a second full moon in one calendar month.\u00a0Joe Rao\u00a0from space.com\u00a0explains: \"A second full moon in a single calendar month is sometimes called a blue moon. A black moon is supposedly the flip side of a blue moon; the second new moon in a single calendar month.\" Supermoon\u00a0is seen behind the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, in May 2012. Credit: AP Photo\/Victor R. Caivano The infrequent nature of this lunar event led to the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" to signify a rare occurrence. It does not actually mean the moon will be blue. Blood moon: Also known as a\u00a0supermoon lunar eclipse. It's\u00a0when\u00a0the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a\u00a0rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. \u00a0There was one in the UK in September 2015, and before that in 1982\u00a0but the next one won't be until 2033.\u00a0 Strawberry moon: A rare event when there's a full moon on the same day as the summer solstice. It happened in June 2016 for the first time since 1967 when\u00a017 hours of sunlight gave way to a bright moonlit sky. Despite the name, the moon does appear pink or red. The romantic label was coined by the Algonquin tribes of North America who believed June\u2019s full moon signalled the beginning of the strawberry picking season. What is a supermoon? Ever looked\u00a0up at the night sky to see a full\u00a0moon so close you could almost touch it? Well you've probably\u00a0spotted a supermoon. The impressive sight\u00a0happens\u00a0when a full moon is at the point in its orbit that brings it closest to Earth. To us Earth-lings,\u00a0it\u00a0appears\u00a030 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger to the naked eye.\u00a0 How a supermoon is generated Supermoon is not an astrological term though. It's scientific\u00a0name is actually\u00a0Perigee Full Moon, but supermoon is more catchy\u00a0and is used by the media to describe our celestial neighbour when it gets up close. Astrologer\u00a0Richard Nolle first\u00a0came up with the term supermoon and he defined it as \"\u2026 a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90 per cent\u00a0of) its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit\", according to earthsky.org. How many supermoons are there\u00a0in 2018? There are two full moon supermoons this year, both taking place in the first month of the year. The first appeared\u00a0on January 2 and the second will appear on January 31. As it will be the second moon of the month, the latter moon is also known as a blue moon. There will also be two new moon supermoons in 2018: one on July 13 and another on August 11.\u00a0Unfortunately, stargazers were unable to see these moons as new moons are generally obscured by the light of the sun. Last year we were lucky enough to have four supermoons. The first three -\u00a0April 26, May 25,\u00a0June 24 - were new moons.\u00a0 The fourth supermoon of 2017 appeared on December 3\u00a0and was a full moon supermoon. This will be a full moon supermoon. In fact, it's the first of three full moon supermoons in a row.\u00a0 Supermoon rises over Auckland, New Zealand in August 2014. Credit: Simon Runting\/REX What do I look for? Head outside at sunset\u00a0when the moon is closest to the horizon and marvel at its size.\u00a0As well as being closer and brighter, the moon (clouds permitting) should also\u00a0look orange and red in colour. Why? Well, as moonlight passes through the thicker section of the\u00a0atmosphere, light\u00a0particles at the red end of the spectrum don't scatter as easily as light at the blue end of the spectrum. So when the moon looks red, you're just looking at red light that wasn't scattered.\u00a0As the moon gets higher in the sky, it returns to its normal white\/yellow\u00a0colour.\u00a0 Will the\u00a0tides be larger? Yes. When full or new moons are\u00a0especially close to Earth, it leads to higher tides. Tides are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun.\u00a0Because the sun and moon go through different alignments, this affects the size of the tides. Tell me more about the moon The moon\u00a0is\u00a04.6 billion years old and was formed between 30-50 million years after the solar system. It is smaller than Earth -\u00a0about the same size as Pluto in fact. Its\u00a0surface area is\u00a0less than the surface\u00a0area of Asia - about 14.6 million square miles\u00a0according to space.com Gravity on the moon is only 1\/6 of that found on Earth. The moon is not round, but is egg-shaped with the large end pointed towards Earth. It would take 135 days to drive by car to the moon at 70 mph\u00a0(or nine years to walk). The moon has\u00a0\"moonquakes\"\u00a0caused by the gravitational pull of Earth. Experts believe the moon has a molten core, just like Earth.\u00a0 How was the Moon formed? How the Moon was formed Man on the Moon Only 12 people have ever walked on the moon and they were all American men, including (most famously) Neil Armstrong who was the first in 1969 on the Apollo II mission.\u00a0 The last time mankind sent someone to the moon was in 1972 when\u00a0Gene Cernan visited on the Apollo 17 mission. Although\u00a0Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon,\u00a0Buzz Aldrin was the first man to urinate there. While millions watched the moon landing on live television, Aldrin was forced to go in a\u00a0tube fitted inside his space suit.

It was the smell of moon-dust brought in on their boots. The mineral, armalcolite, discovered during the first moon landing and later found at various locations on Earth, was named after the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil ARMstrong, Buzz ALdrin and Michael COLlins. An estimated 600 million people watched the Apollo 11 landing live on television, a world record until 750 million people watched the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. One of President Nixon\u2019s speechwriters had prepared an address entitled: \u201cIn Event of Moon Disaster\u201d. It began: \u201cFate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay to rest in peace.\u201d If the launch from the Moon had failed, Houston was to close down communications and leave Armstrong and Aldrin to their death.\u00a0 How the Daily Telegraph reported Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon in 1969","published_at":1520533093,"content_id":"d7311fd0-92d0-3617-bd85-fbf333b66474","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/complete-list-every-full-moon-170622860.html","content_published_at":1520424283,"content_time":1520424283,"content_relative_time":124,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":124,"comment_relative_time":124,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"28c95de2-c5fe-3df1-9c37-0f91e97f200b","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-c25a668a-a48d-38f2-89b4-b41870a98f0b_a-28c95de2-c5fe-3df1-9c37-0f91e97f200b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-c25a668a-a48d-38f2-89b4-b41870a98f0b_a-28c95de2-c5fe-3df1-9c37-0f91e97f200b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/china-launches-scaled-down-reusable-4dty32p","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"NextBigFuture.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.nextbigfuture.com\/2018\/03\/china-launches-scaled-down-reusable-space-plane.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gOEx58kxkc5lWB.rkr4v1Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lLt8BFXcO90TcvOl.eQGLg--\/dz02MzQ7aD0zNzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_28c95de2-c5fe-3df1-9c37-0f91e97f200b--659673824.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/41oXFWIWc5tWKYrTa2wbYg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzk7dz02MzQ7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lLt8BFXcO90TcvOl.eQGLg--\/dz02MzQ7aD0zNzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_28c95de2-c5fe-3df1-9c37-0f91e97f200b--659673824.jpeg","height":379,"width":634,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lLt8BFXcO90TcvOl.eQGLg--\/dz02MzQ7aD0zNzk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_28c95de2-c5fe-3df1-9c37-0f91e97f200b--659673824.jpeg","imgw":634,"imgh":379,"title":"China launches scaled down reusable space plane","summary":"The South China Morning Post reports that China launched a scaled-down model of a multipurpose, reusable space plane from a test site in the Gobi Desert late last month, part of its race to develop space travel technology.

But an enticing one. A new study has once again tackled the implications of a black hole's event horizon \u2014 the point beyond which not even light can escape its gravitational pull. This time, mathematicians have been crunching the numbers to determine if an object can cross this point of no return \u2014 and travel beyond. It's generally thought an even horizon is an impenetrable line in space and time. Whatever goes over the edge is lost, forever. Many astrophysicists say what's inside is impossible to study. The laws of physics break down to a point where they're simply incomprehensible. But one international team of researchers have been busily poking holes in this assumption.","published_at":1520502868,"content_id":"fef405c9-9d1b-3970-99fa-abf63861a8f6","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/2018\/03\/07\/passing-through-black-hole-could-open-up-whole-new-future-but-it-would-erase-your-past.html","content_published_at":1520432700,"content_time":1520432700,"content_relative_time":122,"reaction_count":2,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":122,"comment_relative_time":122,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-453e42d2-caf3-3f75-be9b-46ad5dea7ecb_a-84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-453e42d2-caf3-3f75-be9b-46ad5dea7ecb_a-84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-453e42d2-caf3-3f75-be9b-46ad5dea7ecb_a-84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"New York Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/03\/07\/chinas-runaway-space-station-could-crash-into-earth-this-month\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jUX5zMy31TMB_mMeJjEvAg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qHUw3lOjXnwp7TQVhJzAEg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1--523246108.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gvxpFbxcrTp4JnREyFGiog--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qHUw3lOjXnwp7TQVhJzAEg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1--523246108.jpeg","height":800,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qHUw3lOjXnwp7TQVhJzAEg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1--523246108.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":800,"title":"China's runaway space station could crash into Earth this month","summary":"It's now been several months since China admitted that it had completely lost control of its Tiangong-1 space station, explaining that without the ability to adjust its position in orbit the huge manmade object will eventually come falling back down to Earth. In late 2017 the Chinese government offered a very rough forecast of when the satellite could collide with our planet and now it's looking more and more like March might be the month when it happens. According to the latest information from the European Space Agency, which is tracking the object's movement, the space station is now expected to come tumbling down somewhere between March 24th and April 19th. Scientists believe that it will re-enter Earth's atmosphere between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south latitudes.","published_at":1520502376,"content_id":"84d28134-8499-324b-adc3-c2a07a8ed1f1","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/03\/07\/chinas-runaway-space-station-could-crash-into-earth-this-month\/","content_published_at":1520439348,"content_time":1520439348,"content_relative_time":120,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":120,"comment_relative_time":120,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

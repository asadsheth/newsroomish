The story notes that Trump has ignored his chief of staff and many of his putative top advisers to seek the informal advice of his true confidants. One of those confidants is Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt. \u201cThe two speak frequently,\u201d the Times reports, \u201cand the president enjoys discussing his negative view of Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, with the embattled E.P.A. leader.\u201d The importance of this anecdote is not merely that Trump is standing behind his comically scandal-tarred EPA head.","published_at":1528722670,"content_id":"728acb40-2351-32f5-8835-823421c76acf","content_url":"http:\/\/nymag.com\/daily\/intelligencer\/2018\/06\/how-trump-could-get-scott-pruitt-to-fire-robert-mueller.html","content_published_at":1528721957,"content_time":1528721957,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Russia investigation","vibe_id":"2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-04b5984d-4f07-3ce6-abeb-d806263b3ecc_a-81712cbf-481b-3d2a-ac75-6d533807b14a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/russia-investigation\/theres-actually-lots-evidence-trump-3si4goc","author":"nanook","provider":"vox","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/6\/11\/17438386\/trump-russia-collusion","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/F.zd5o4nk.XbEUZq8EXxlA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cMnYaQM49.HTneuzHzdcrA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_81712cbf-481b-3d2a-ac75-6d533807b14a--1383677536.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vDRBDdzhrelfr3knO7.klw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cMnYaQM49.HTneuzHzdcrA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_81712cbf-481b-3d2a-ac75-6d533807b14a--1383677536.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cMnYaQM49.HTneuzHzdcrA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_81712cbf-481b-3d2a-ac75-6d533807b14a--1383677536.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"There's actually lots of evidence of Trump-Russia collusion","summary":"\u201cIn all of this, in any of this, there's been no evidence that there's been any collusion between the Trump campaign and President Trump and Russia,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday at his weekly press conference. \u201cLet's just make that really clear.

There was a risk, North said, in \u201ctreating symptom without treating the disease.\u201d And the disease, he said, isn't the Second Amendment. Santa Fe High School was considered a hardened target, with an active-shooter plan and two armed police officers on patrol. North, 74, is a high-profile choice to lead the NRA, which has faced mounting criticism since the Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which a gunman killed 17 people.","published_at":1526821632,"content_id":"6f6a0e06-b417-3bf7-91ee-98d9b3d1d78e","content_url":"https:\/\/bangordailynews.com\/2018\/05\/20\/news\/nation\/oliver-north-incoming-nra-chief-blames-school-shootings-on-culture-of-violence\/","content_published_at":1526815781,"content_time":1526815781,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NRA","vibe_id":"8e8a0713-ac8e-37d4-9216-1225cfe1812d","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-8e8a0713-ac8e-37d4-9216-1225cfe1812d_c-839215d8-c195-366b-9499-08ad9d21fec6_a-15c7fa77-c4d8-3ec5-8cfd-cb2f1594b872","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nra\/v-8e8a0713-ac8e-37d4-9216-1225cfe1812d_c-839215d8-c195-366b-9499-08ad9d21fec6_a-15c7fa77-c4d8-3ec5-8cfd-cb2f1594b872","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Daily Beast","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/nras-oliver-north-blames-school-shootings-on-ritalin?yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kKQFfpYmCUhqya6etJgZCg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C00uOCqcRoe2rgvkpwu7pA--\/dz0xNDgwO2g9ODMzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_15c7fa77-c4d8-3ec5-8cfd-cb2f1594b872-980222558.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YMRvkGIDk_UM5YwT3oHeVg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MzM7dz0xNDgwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C00uOCqcRoe2rgvkpwu7pA--\/dz0xNDgwO2g9ODMzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_15c7fa77-c4d8-3ec5-8cfd-cb2f1594b872-980222558.jpeg","height":833,"width":1480,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C00uOCqcRoe2rgvkpwu7pA--\/dz0xNDgwO2g9ODMzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_15c7fa77-c4d8-3ec5-8cfd-cb2f1594b872-980222558.jpeg","imgw":1480,"imgh":833,"title":"NRA's Oliver North Blames School Shootings on Ritalin","summary":"Incoming National Rifle Association President Oliver North on Sunday announced plans to boost the organization's membership while at the same time dismissing the role of guns in a spate of recent high school shootings.

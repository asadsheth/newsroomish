A middle school student protested silently. He carried a sign reading, \"Who's next? No guns!\" A few drivers shouted their support, but the event brought out a lot of anger. \"It's ridiculous, especially in Noblesville,\" Ashley Dick of Noblesville told us. \"It happened yesterday - in Noblesville. They are trying to recruit new members. Why? Why? What's the point?\" The Hoosier Armory gun store sponsored the NRA's visit. The store's owners told us the enrollment event was planned months ago.","published_at":1527433793,"content_id":"b417466e-b389-31ea-bc55-8092b5e206e0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.wthr.com\/article\/noblesville-student-protests-nra-enrolling-new-members-day-after-shooting?category_id=551&landing_page_nid=1823556","content_published_at":1527371741,"content_time":1527371741,"content_relative_time":68,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NRA","vibe_id":"8e8a0713-ac8e-37d4-9216-1225cfe1812d","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

Santana, at that point, had never pitched above Class A ball, but had been in the Astros' system long enough to be subject to the Rule 5 Draft, which exists to prevent clubs from stashing Major League-ready players in their farm systems for too long.

Players selected in the Rule 5 Draft must remain on the 25-man roster of their new teams for an entire season or be returned to their original organizations, so the Twins held on to Santana even though he was outright terrible in 2000.","published_at":1521820280,"content_id":"0af41dbe-9045-3507-8e5e-e812d39092f8","content_url":"http:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2018\/03\/minor-league-baseball-congress-spending-bill-flsa-nonsense-minimum-wage-mlb\/","content_published_at":1521820151,"content_time":1521820151,"content_relative_time":8,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":8,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"51b7c015-2987-3a81-86c0-845069909660","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-6988b7a1-9331-3615-8c06-e2cd9cfa4c3a_a-51b7c015-2987-3a81-86c0-845069909660","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-6988b7a1-9331-3615-8c06-e2cd9cfa4c3a_a-51b7c015-2987-3a81-86c0-845069909660","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/week-ahead-wanna-fast-132100841--spt-2e1h8f5","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Rotoworld","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/week-ahead-wanna-fast-132100841--spt.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yBw1YXk.vNP6CueHqafBpg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/Sports\/Rotoworld\/MLB_Greinke1_300.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uqt65NsIgJuz3rHd5cOYkg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/Sports\/Rotoworld\/MLB_Greinke1_300.jpg","height":200,"width":300,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/Sports\/Rotoworld\/MLB_Greinke1_300.jpg","imgw":300,"imgh":200,"title":"Week Ahead: I Wanna Go Fast","summary":"Seth Trachtman looks at spring training pitcher velocities as we approach the start of the MLB season.","published_at":1521811936,"content_id":"51b7c015-2987-3a81-86c0-845069909660","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/week-ahead-wanna-fast-132100841--spt.html","content_published_at":1521814860,"content_time":1521814860,"content_relative_time":10,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":10,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9671da93-e584-3596-8678-e6454226f5a7","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-e442d5d4-c4c0-30f2-b3c4-ae59265e8192_a-9671da93-e584-3596-8678-e6454226f5a7","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-e442d5d4-c4c0-30f2-b3c4-ae59265e8192_a-9671da93-e584-3596-8678-e6454226f5a7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/mlb-tried-debunk-juiced-balls-2rbui2k","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Washington Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/sports\/wp\/2018\/03\/23\/mlb-tried-to-debunk-juiced-balls-theory-amid-historic-home-run-spike-pitchers-remain-skeptical\/?src=rss","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"MLB tried to debunk 'juiced balls' theory amid historic home run spike.

their quest to win a World Series.\u00a0 MLB is kicking things off earlier than normal this season, with all 30 teams in action on March 29. This marks the first time in 50 years that every club will play on the season's first day, per MLB.com's Mark Newman. On the heels of a strange offseason, in which most of the top free agents waited until at least February to sign deals, it's hard to know what will happen when games begin.\u00a0 For now, though, there appears to be a clear dividing line between the true playoff contenders in both leagues and everyone else.\u00a0 2018 MLB Power Rankings","published_at":1521671790,"content_id":"cb387b44-5182-3e4d-9a79-8c2b386ad2ce","content_url":"https:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2762044-mlb-power-rankings-2018-where-each-team-stands-ahead-of-opening-day","content_published_at":1521543601,"content_time":1521543601,"content_relative_time":85,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":85,"comment_relative_time":85,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"3a881f90-bf73-3f82-a4de-8904d9cba755","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-9b20a860-f153-30b9-b223-c413b6da8c83_a-3a881f90-bf73-3f82-a4de-8904d9cba755","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-9b20a860-f153-30b9-b223-c413b6da8c83_a-3a881f90-bf73-3f82-a4de-8904d9cba755","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/professional-sports-leagues-head-head-68w4vw8","author":"nanook","provider":"kuow.org","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/kuow.org\/post\/professional-sports-leagues-go-head-head-new-tax-code","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Vxs.sDNq_eBFjjVHr1_aiQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/P4WmdaYkTQjUNvMulWavgw--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3a881f90-bf73-3f82-a4de-8904d9cba755--958174418.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w.HyZ0jMN.E_GA5kv6LcSg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MDA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/P4WmdaYkTQjUNvMulWavgw--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3a881f90-bf73-3f82-a4de-8904d9cba755--958174418.jpeg","height":600,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/P4WmdaYkTQjUNvMulWavgw--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_3a881f90-bf73-3f82-a4de-8904d9cba755--958174418.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":600,"title":"Professional Sports Leagues Go Head-To-Head With New Tax Code","summary":"A single four-letter word \u2013 added to a provision of the tax code \u2013 has professional sports leagues scrambling, as teams face what could be millions of dollars in new taxes. \"Real.\" The revision changed a section of the tax code that applies to \"like-kind exchanges.\" Under the old law, farmers, manufacturers and other businesses could swap certain \"property\" assets \u2013 such as trucks and machinery \u2013 without immediately paying taxes on the difference in value. The 2017 tax overhaul inserted the word \"real\" before \"property.\" With that, the provision now applies only to real estate swaps. That means teams could be looking at tax bills in the millions for trading player contracts.

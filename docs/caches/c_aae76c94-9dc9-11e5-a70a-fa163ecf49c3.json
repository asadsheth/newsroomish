This week, we got a look at those caps for the 2018 season, the usual Father's Day, Mother's Day, Memorial Day and Fourth of July holidays were all included. The Independence Day caps have one major issue, though. The history is flawed. Inside the bill of each cap reads, \u201cWe The People,\u201d which is an objectively significant phrase in American history. It just doesn't have much to do with Independence Day. UniWatch's Paul Lukas was among the fans who pointed out the historical error. Fourth of July, of course, celebrates the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted on July 4, 1776. \u201cWe the People\u201d is the

Surprisingly, Clemson only has a couple of Major League players. It's vexing, given the success the program has experienced, winning 40+ games six times in the last 10 years. The most notable players Clemson has put in the big leagues in the last two decades have been SP Kris Benson and SS Khalil Greene. Benson had two very nice seasons in his nine year career. In his age 25 season (2000) with the Pirates, he pitched 217.2 innings with a 3.85 ERA, 10 wins, and 184 strikeouts. In 2004 between the Pirates and the Mets, he won 12 games pitching 200.1 innings with a 4.31 ERA and 134","published_at":1521645031,"content_id":"551a70f5-c71a-35d9-b321-12b7e13274d7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.shakinthesouthland.com\/2018\/3\/21\/17136918\/tigers-in-the-majors-a-spring-update-on-clemson-alumni-in-mlb","content_published_at":1521608400,"content_time":1521608400,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-0ccb7225-ae16-3031-bd0b-a6053c3f7100_a-1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-0ccb7225-ae16-3031-bd0b-a6053c3f7100_a-1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-0ccb7225-ae16-3031-bd0b-a6053c3f7100_a-1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","author":"third_watch","provider":"Bleed Cubbie Blue","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.bleedcubbieblue.com\/2018\/3\/21\/17146264\/mlb-bullets-alex-cobb-orioles-justin-turner-injury-yankees-red-sox-london-bob-uecker-tough","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IU1ruj2z86NuKuOvgD.WAg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E87EbZBpP_oeATpoFRlN7A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40-582694635.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XvLGQfdzhoXD2pWOK.xDBg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E87EbZBpP_oeATpoFRlN7A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40-582694635.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E87EbZBpP_oeATpoFRlN7A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40-582694635.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"MLB Bullets will make it better","summary":"Free agent pitcher Alex Cobb waited all winter, but he's finally found a new team as he's agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. This assumes he passes the physical, which is no sure thing with the Orioles. David Schoenfield looks at where Cobb fits in with the Orioles. He fills a big need and he makes the Orioles better, but they still seem to be far from competing in the AL East. It is interesting, Schoenfield notes, that Cobb waited out the market and got the contract he was looking for at the start of the winter (or at least the contract that was projected for him). Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner has a broken wrist after being hit in the hand by a fastball by Athletics pitcher Kendall Graveman.","published_at":1521622904,"content_id":"1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bleedcubbieblue.com\/2018\/3\/21\/17146264\/mlb-bullets-alex-cobb-orioles-justin-turner-injury-yankees-red-sox-london-bob-uecker-tough","content_published_at":1521608400,"content_time":1521608400,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"bf860267-e836-3bbe-9f87-ebd064ce39d1","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-4fc30c13-7e0a-304f-941f-868e558eb51b_a-bf860267-e836-3bbe-9f87-ebd064ce39d1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-4fc30c13-7e0a-304f-941f-868e558eb51b_a-bf860267-e836-3bbe-9f87-ebd064ce39d1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/2018-mlb-win-projections-odds-61vqle0","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"CBS Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cbssports.com\/mlb\/news\/2018-mlb-win-projections-odds-yankees-finish-under-94-5-wins\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7FEmcIvjmnGH21aEyEyacw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GnQ._Mt5lMiyfchEXamWig--\/dz03NzA7aD00MzM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bf860267-e836-3bbe-9f87-ebd064ce39d1-799372124.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nnzOJOd0dILMCYxYCAeeTA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzM7dz03NzA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GnQ._Mt5lMiyfchEXamWig--\/dz03NzA7aD00MzM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bf860267-e836-3bbe-9f87-ebd064ce39d1-799372124.jpeg","height":433,"width":770,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GnQ._Mt5lMiyfchEXamWig--\/dz03NzA7aD00MzM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_bf860267-e836-3bbe-9f87-ebd064ce39d1-799372124.jpeg","imgw":770,"imgh":433,"title":"2018 MLB win projections: Odds Yankees finish under 94.5 wins","summary":"The New York Yankees were one of the most surprising teams in baseball last season.

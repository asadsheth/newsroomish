The Royal family More than 50 Members of the Royal family were invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011, which gives us a clue as to how many will be attending the younger prince's nuptials this year.. The first royal name to be confirmed was of course\u00a0Prince William, who will be Prince Harry's best man. Harry was his brother's best man in 2011; however the decision means the Duke of Cambridge, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final happening on the same day. While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will both be there, with their older children Prince George and Princess Charlotte confirmed as pageboy and bridesmaid, the newborn Louis will stay away from the public eye.\u00a0Prince Louis, who will be less than a month old by the time of the wedding, is likely to be cared for by a nanny close by.

Lady Jane, who remains close to members of the Royal Family but has stayed away from the limelight following her sister\u2019s death, will be joined by her siblings Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer at the Windsor Castle wedding. It has been\u00a0announced that Ms Markle will be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls. The bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren.\u00a0The pageboys\u00a0are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.

While it has been confirmed that the Duchess of York has been invited to the service, she is said to be\u00a0\u201cdeeply unhappy\u201d that she has not been invited to the Prince of Wales' private reception later in the day.

Ms Dooley, who has admitted she has not seen Ms Markle for 20 years,\u00a0has previously told ITV's Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday. Yet she is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she \"will be in the front row cheering them on\" in Windsor. The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all time Harry's friends Harry and renowned party animal Tom Inskip\u00a0have been friends since they were pupils at Eton together. Harry was\u00a0rumoured to be best man at his Jamaican wedding last year, when he married the\u00a0flame haired Lara Hughes-Young.

He has been present at some of the Prince's most controversial moments, including when he was photographed naked at a private party. Also rumoured to be on the guest list are Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson.\u00a0Heiress to the Holiday Inn empire, Wilson is married to Guy Pelly, setting a precedent for\u00a0Americans to marry\u00a0into the royals' inner 'set'.\u00a0 Harry and the Duke of Cambridge were spotted with Princess Beatrice at Pelly's 2014\u00a0wedding in the US; surely an invite to the wedding of the year would be appropriately return the\u00a0favour? Pelly was thrown into the public eye in 2012\u00a0when he\u00a0was\u00a0awarded \u00a340,000 by News International after an\u00a0admission\u00a0that it had\u00a0hacked\u00a0his phone, as well as\u00a0incorrectly\u00a0accusing Pelly of supplying Harry with marijuana.

Jake Warren, a\u00a0friend from Harry's Eton era, the son of the Queen's racing manager, and\u00a0godson\u00a0of Princess Diana, is also likely to attend. Meghan's friends Priyanka Chopra confirmed to US Weekly on April 25 that will attend the wedding. When asked about her outfit, she added: \"I sort of may have an idea...\u00a0But no, I haven\u2019t picked one out yet.\" On the same day, she disclosed that she would not be a bridesmaid.\u00a0 Chopra is an Indian actress, film producer, singer and the winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant, who\u00a0penned a tribute to Meghan in\u00a0Time magazine's\u00a0100 Most Influential People list, released in April.\u00a0She wrote: \"This ever-smiling, strong free spirit found her prince, fell in love and in turn made a cynical world believe in fairy tales again.

It is thought the same applies to other former flame Cressida Bonas.\u00a0 Also allegedly left off the guest list is Pippa Middleton, after Meghan Markle was conspicuously not seen at her wedding ceremony.

Invitees will be made up of 100 pupils from two local schools, The Royal School and St George's School, as well as representatives from Prince Harry\u2019s key charities\u00a0and members of the public from all over the UK who have served their communities.\u00a0They include: Philip Gillespie Philip Gillespie Credit: Michael Cooper\/PA Philip, 30, from Ballymena\u00a0lost his right leg in an IED incident in Afghanistan and now raises funds and awareness for ABF The Soldiers' Charity.

Mrs Goodman\u2019s 15-year-old granddaughter, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, was killed in the terror attack last year. The couple will also invite 530 members of staff from the Royal Household and Crown Estate\u00a0and more than 600 people from the Windsor Castle community.

Among the royals not invited are Lady Amelia Windsor and her sister, Marina;\u00a0Gabriella and Frederick Windsor;\u00a0 Lady Davina Lewis and Gary Lewi; and\u00a0Lady Helen Taylor and Timothy Taylor. It has been confirmed that American president Donald Trump has not been invited to the wedding.\u00a0When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married in 2011,\u00a0Commonwealth and European political figures\u00a0were present but the then-President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle were not invited. However, as Meghan is the first American to marry into the Royal family since 1937,\u00a0many wondered if Trump would be invited. Yet on April 10, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said: \"It has been decided that an official list of political leaders \u2013 both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.\" In the past Trump has made unfavourable remarks about Harry's mother, Diana,\u00a0telling\u00a0Howard Stern in 2000 he would have \"slept with Princess Diana without hesitation\"\u00a0before adding \"She was crazy but you know these are minor details\".\u00a0 He also\u00a0publicly commented that\u00a0the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry\u2019s sister-in-law, was\u00a0\"stupid\" after she was\u00a0photographed topless\u00a0in France\u00a0in 2012. Theresa May will also not be attending the wedding, despite her predecessor David Cameron attending the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011. Because of Prince Harry and Barack Obama's burgeoning friendship \u2013\u00a0the royal interviewing the former president for Radio 4's Today programme at the end of 2017 \u2013\u00a0there were suggestions that Obama would be on the royal guest list.

When asked at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on April 19 he said: \"I, of course, wish them the very best. But I have important responsibilities elsewhere.\" The invitations Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor.\u00a0\u00a0 Royal sources have said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George\u2019s Chapel is relatively small\u00a0and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession. Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.

The first royal name to be confirmed was of course\u00a0Prince William, who will be Prince Harry's best man. Harry was his brother's best man in 2011; however the decision means the Duke of Cambridge, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final happening on the same day. While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will both be there, with their older children Prince George and Princess Charlotte expected to be in the bridal party, the newborn Louis will stay away from the public eye.\u00a0Prince Louis, who will be less than a month old by the time of the wedding, is likely to be cared for by a nanny close by. The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are also sure to attend. The Prince and Ms Markle have invited all three of the late Princess\u2019 siblings to the wedding, with Lady Jane Fellowes giving the reading. Lady Jane, who remains close to members of the Royal Family but has stayed away from the limelight following her sister\u2019s death, will be joined by her siblings Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer at the Windsor Castle wedding.

The bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren.\u00a0The pageboys\u00a0are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney. Royal siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year. \u00a0 Prince Harry has paid tribute to former mentor and close friend Mark Dyer by requesting his son Jasper as a pageboy, while Ms Markle has publicly recognised one of her best friends, stylist Jessica Mulroney, by choosing her twin sons to take part in the wedding. While it has been confirmed that the Duchess of York has been invited to the service, she is said to be\u00a0\u201cdeeply unhappy\u201d that she has not been invited to the Prince of Wales' private reception later in the day. The Duke of York and his daughters with Fergie,\u00a0Princesses Beatrice and\u00a0Eugenie of York are said to be attending both events. Other royal relatives\u00a0are likely to include\u00a0The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and Kent, The Princess Royal, the Queen's granddaughter\u00a0Zara Tindall and her husband Mark Tindall.\u00a0 Members of other royal families from around the world are not expected to attend, although Prince Seeiso of Lesotho might be an exception. In 2006 he and Prince Harry founded the Sentebale charity, \u00a0with the aim to help vulnerable children and young people in the country. Meghan's family Meghan Markle has confirmed her father Thomas Markle will not be attending her wedding, saying she hopes he can be given the \"space he needs to focus on his health\".\u00a0 In a statement issued through Kensington Palace, Ms Markle said: \"Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. \"I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\" The question of who will walk Meghan down the aisle is currently unanswered \u2013\u00a0though it is expected that her mother, who will be travelling with the bride to the chapel, will take on the role instead. Meanwhile, Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, has been seen getting on a plane from Los Angeles - carrying a Burberry dress bag.\u00a0Doria, 60,\u00a0was born in Los Angeles to an antique dealer father and a mother who was a nurse.\u00a0After school she worked as a make-up artist, which is how she met her husband, Thomas Markle, a lighting director in Hollywood. The pair married in 1979 and Ms Markle was born two years later.\u00a0Ms Ragland later took a job as an air stewardess, meaning their daughter was frequently cared for by her father. Doria now lives in the house she inherited from her father in 2011 in the Crenshaw area of LA.\u00a0Ms Ragland\u00a0and her daughter are extremely close - Ms Ragland once drove a car with the number plate MEGNME - and Ms Markle has spoken of her pride in her free-spirited mother, with her dreadlocks and nose ring. Meghan Markle with her moother Doria, who has a masters in social work Credit: TIM STEWART NEWS LIMITED\u00a0 Ms Ragland and Mr Markle divorced in 1987, but remained friends.

No one has one yet. Still waiting. I hope London is wheelchair friendly. Excited!', before continuing 'Smoke and mirros cannot hide the elephant in the room.

Among the royals not invited are Lady Amelia Windsor and her sister, Marina;\u00a0Gabriella and Frederick Windsor;\u00a0 Lady Davina Lewis and Gary Lewi; and\u00a0Lady Helen Taylor and Timothy Taylor. It has been confirmed that American president Donald Trump has not been invited to the wedding.\u00a0When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married in 2011,\u00a0Commonwealth and European political figures\u00a0were present but the then-President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle were not invited. However, as Meghan is the first American to marry into the Royal family since 1937,\u00a0many wondered if Trump would be invited. Yet on April 10, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said: \"It has been decided that an official list of political leaders \u2013 both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.\" In the past Trump has made unfavourable remarks about Harry's mother, Diana,\u00a0telling\u00a0Howard Stern in 2000 he would have \"slept with Princess Diana without hesitation\"\u00a0before adding \"She was crazy but you know these are minor details\".\u00a0 He also\u00a0publicly commented that\u00a0the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry\u2019s sister-in-law, was\u00a0\"stupid\" after she was\u00a0photographed topless\u00a0in France\u00a0in 2012. Theresa May will also not be attending the wedding, despite her predecessor David Cameron attending the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011. Because of Prince Harry and Barack Obama's burgeoning friendship \u2013\u00a0the royal interviewing the former president for Radio 4's Today programme at the end of 2017 \u2013\u00a0there were suggestions that Obama would be on the royal guest list.

When asked at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on April 19 he said: \"I, of course, wish them the very best.

after a difficult week. Ms Markle appeared in good spirits in the car, as she and the Prince were driven down the Long Walk in Windsor. Fiddling with her engagement ring, she wore a simple white shirt with her hair half up and half\u00a0down for a day of final wedding preparations. Prince Harry, who appeared more solemn, was also dressed down, with a grey jumper and white shirt, still sporting a beard. Hours earlier, Ms Markle had confirmed that her father will not be walking her down the aisle at St George's Chapel, in a statement released through Kensington Palace. In a\u00a0personal statement, Meghan Markle said: 'I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health' Credit: Enterprise News and Pictures \"Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,\" she said. \"I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. \"I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support.

Thousands of people turned out to get a flavour of how Saturday will unfold, when the newlyweds head on a 25-minute carriage ride through the town. Video: Military rehearse for wedding day in Windsor Some 250 members of the armed forces are expected to take part in Saturday's festivities, and Thursday's dry run gave organisers a chance to put some finishing touches to the event. Roads around Windsor were closed as wellwishers basked beneath blue skies and beaming sunshine - weather that is expected to stay around for the weekend. Royal wedding countdown in pictures as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's preparations begin Press from around the world, tourists, locals and royal superfans watched from behind barriers as members of the\u00a0military\u00a0paraded around Windsor and up The Long Walk. There was a heavy police presence with armed officers stationed around town and other officers on top of buildings looking over the crowds. The procession included a horsedrawn carriage, setting the scene for what the world will see on Saturday when the newly married Harry and Ms Markle will be seen by the public after the ceremony. After The Wedding Route Mr Markle is still in Mexico where he is recovering after undergoing heart surgery on Wednesday to implant three stents. The reclusive former TV lighting director, who had been due to walk his daughter down the aisle, was caught up in controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi. He reportedly pulled out of attending the ceremony in St George's Chapel on May 19 to avoid embarrassing his daughter, but then later said before his surgery that he wanted to be part of history and hoped to be there, celebrity gossip website TMZ reported.

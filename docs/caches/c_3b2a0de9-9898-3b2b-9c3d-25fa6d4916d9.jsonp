It's hard to cope with the death of a pet, especially when it was a member of your household for many years. When Scottish Twitter user Lucie Dunne and her family had to put down their dog, her mom took the loss especially hard. As a teacher, Mrs. Dunne was stressing about going back to the classroom after the emotional loss, probably knowing she'd have to field the awkward questions and comments that kids are so prone to tossing out. But one thoughtful child in her class knew the perfect way to comfort his grieving teacher \u2014 with a poem.

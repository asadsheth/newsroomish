Unfortunately, she must sell and I have to move by the end of March.About four or five years ago a Siamese cat started showing up and spending all her time in my small patio area. About three weeks later, a grey and white cat joined her. My friend and I assigned them names and gender as they were, and still are, skittish and won't let us get anywhere near them. About a month or so after they started hanging out here permanently, we started feeding them and leaving out water daily. Well, as you have probably guessed, now we don't know what to do with them.

footage shows woman plunging into frozen lake to rescue stranded dog","summary":"Footage of a woman wading into an icy lake to rescue a stranded dog has gone viral. SEE ALSO: Firefighters rescue a dog stuck on a frozen river with incredible scooching skills The dramatic event took place on Trout Lake in Vancouver, Canada, on Friday, after a dog wandered out to the middle of the lake before falling through the ice. Ben West was filming on the edge of the lake at the time, and documented the whole thing on his phone. Oh my God... Just watched this woman rescue a dog that fell in the ice at Trout lake!!! I have a little video from it that I will post as soon as I get warm and calm down a bit. What a hero. Community supporter her and got her in a warm bath and called 911. pic.twitter.com\/sqChr6OnCw \u2014 Ben West \ud83d\udd25 (@BenWest) February 23, 2018 He also posted a longer update, giving a detailed outline of what happened and confirming the woman was receiving treatment, on his Instagram. This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen with my own eyes. A dog went out on the ice and fell through at Trout Lake and without hesitating this woman went out in the water breaking the ice with her hands and rescued the dog!?! It wasn't even her dog. I'm so inspired and so happy it all worked out for the best. I saw the dog fall through the ice and screamed out. Community members all rushed to help and support her. We were all calling the dog's name so it would keep swimming. She was rushed to a house in the neighbourhood and put in a warm bath while the paramedics were enroute. A few of us then had to chase this woman's dog around in circles in the park as she looked for her owner. We finally got her and brought back to her owner. Wow... #dogs #eastVan #picoftheday #hero #yvr A post shared by Ben West \ud83d\udd25 (@_ben_west_) on Feb 23, 2018 at 11:20am PST West confirmed the dog was okay, too. I'm sorry I don't know if you know this but is the pup safe and does it have a home? \u2014 Jack Byrne (@TID_JByrne) February 24, 2018 It was back with it's person right after the rescue and we saw it playing with other dogs and seemed fine a little while later when we were leaving the park. \u2014 Ben West \ud83d\udd25 (@BenWest) February 24, 2018 Later, he posted the full video on YouTube. In that clip, someone can be heard shouting \"don't go in\" as the woman steps out onto the lake. \"Yeah, but he can't get out,\" she responds. \"So I have to go in.\" It's worth noting that rescue services definitely don't advise this: It's great this ended with a happy best case outcome. We do not recommend anyone go out on ice without the proper safety equipment & training, ice can be very unpredictable & cold water - deadly. Rescuer safety is first priority. Be safe folks! #BCSAR @BC__AS https:\/\/t.co\/F2a4iV4mj5 \u2014 BCSARA (@BCSARAssoc) February 24, 2018 In this case though, thankfully, the story had a happy ending.

CCTV shows dog waiting on same platform every night","summary":"Heartbreaking footage shows a stray dog gaze longingly at a train every night as if waiting for a familiar face to emerge. At 11pm the female dog stands on Platform 1 at Kanjurmarg Station in Mumbai, India, and stares at a train bound for Kalyan. She peers into the same women-only carriage every time then, when no one gets off, chases the train as it pulls away, the Mumbai Mirror reported. The confusing ritual, captured on CCTV as far back as January 2, has sparked the theory that she is looking for a previous owner who abandoned her at the station. Local resident\u00a0Sameer Thorat filmed the little dog's heartbreaking behaviour last week and posted it to social media, where it went viral.

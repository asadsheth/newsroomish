to pay more to keep your pet healthy in Kentucky","summary":"PADUCAH \u2014 You can soon expect to pay more money to keep your family pet healthy. Kentucky lawmakers recently passed a 6 percent sales tax on small animal veterinarian visits and care services. Gov. Matt Bevin vetoed House Bill 366 on April 9, but lawmakers overrode the decision. Now, local pet lovers are speaking out against the bill. Jackie Cunningham says owning a pet was a bit more affordable when her kids were growing up. \u201cBack then it probably cost around $100-$150 per year, total,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's astronomically higher than that. I'd say at least four times that.\u201d It's a price Cunningham says she's willing to pay to keep her dog, Scooter, healthy.

This puppymill rescue had an exceptional life.\" Heaven has a new star tonight. We\u2019re heartbroken to share the news that Toast has passed. This puppymill rescue had an exceptional life. She wrote a book, had a televised wedding, appears on billboards across the country promoting rescue and modeled for an international eyewear campaign. But above all, she was a best friend, a world champion little spoon...but she was far from being an angel. Toast was often a little devil. Grabbing rolls of toilet paper off and dragging them into the living room for a snack. Peeing whenever\/wherever she wanted to. Pretending not to be able to jump on the couch because she just wanted a ride. And snoring like a 400lb trucker. In the next few weeks we will be doing tributes for her. If Toast has inspired you or taught you about rescue please consider donating to the link in the bio. 100% off the donations will go to her three favorite charities. If you would like to show your love for Toast and the tongue that will never be forgotten, please post a photo using #ToastMeetsHeaven so we can see. Toast loved meeting fans at meet ups and on the streets. She knew she was loved and adored by people around the globe and we are so grateful to have known her.

In her memory, a YouCaring link listed in Toast's Instagram bio seeks to raise $378,000 for three organizations that fight puppy mills like the ones Toast and her sisters were rescued from.\u00a0 Toast led a highly glamorous life for just one dog thanks to Sturino, who used a background in PR to launch a successful career for the rescue pup.\u00a0 During Toast's time in the spotlight, she modeled eyewear for designer Kara Walker and published a book titled ToastHampton: How to Summer in Style.\u00a0 She even did a little modeling work for us here at Mashable.

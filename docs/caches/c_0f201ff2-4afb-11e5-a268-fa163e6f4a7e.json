I learned from watching a week of North Korean TV","summary":"The week began with the faces of the \"Dear Leader\" and his \u201cGreat\u201d father, in a circle, on a red background, with nothing else. The late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il Sung, are omnipresent on North Korean state television. It is as if the channel warns its viewers: This channel is of the Kims, by the Kims and for the Kims. My ABC News colleagues and I in Seoul spent all last week watching the communist state's broadcasts \u2014 from Jan. 22 to 26 \u2013 to get a glimpse into the average North Korean TV viewer's mind. By the end of the week, we had become fans of an animated North Korean measuring scale and were humming propaganda songs praising communism. There's no 'TV Guide'","published_at":1517420765,"content_id":"d7c1d5ef-fd9f-3ed5-a920-21519a64b5b9","content_url":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/learned-watching-week-north-korean-tv\/story?id=52714005","content_published_at":1517374800,"content_time":1517374800,"content_relative_time":62,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":62,"comment_relative_time":62,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

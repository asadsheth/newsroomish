North Korean hackers are believed to be behind a heist that lost an exchange called YouBit nearly 4,000 Bitcoins in April, according to South Korean reports. YouBit - a small player in South Korea's cryptocurrency market - said this morning that hackers had stolen 17 per cent of its crypto assets at 04:35am local time on Tuesday. The price of Bitcoin fell from just under $19,000 (\u00a314,200) to just over $18,000. Customers cryptocurrency assets will be marked down to 75pc, YouBit\u00a0wrote in an apology note posted to its website.\u00a0 The statement, signed from \"all employees\" at YouBit, said that it is calling in administrators and working on minimising customers losses.\u00a0 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is widely speculated have netted millions in cryptocurrency after a spate of cyber attacks Credit: AP Details of the refund process will be confirmed in an \"additional notice\", it added. YouBit said it had made \"ever effort\" to improve its security and hire more security staff following the hack in April, and despite a smaller loss,\u00a0this attack was the final nail in the coffin.\u00a0 South Korea's intelligence service, Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) is investigating.\u00a0 Recent cyber attacks have been linked to North Korea, which is believed to have netted millions in the virtual currency.\u00a0 More is expected as international sanctions limit Pyongyang's\u00a0supply of cash. KISA reported that 7.6 billion won (\u00a35.2\u00a0million) worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen in those previous attacks on multiple exchanges, according to South Korea\u2019s Chosun Ilbo newspaper. Malicious code used in attacks over the summer was \"virtually identical\" to previous attacks connected to North Korea, researchers found.\u00a0 The US this morning blamed Kim Jong-un's regime for the WannaCry ransomware that spread across 150 different countries in May this year, crippling several NHS clinics and hospitals. The largest digital exchange in South Korea is Bithumb which accounts for 70pc of the country's cryptocurrency.\u00a0 Bitcoin exchanges and wallets are hot targets for hackers and it is feared they will become more vulnerable as valuations rise.\u00a0","published_at":1513693223,"content_id":"06904da3-41ca-3c50-bd63-47296684eaae","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/bitcoin-exchange-collapses-second-cyber-135906933.html","content_published_at":1513698007,"content_time":1513698007,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":3,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6cbc1281-c66d-3d01-8f8f-082e4d3fdc71","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-bc2f3557-e6a4-3142-8585-ba0fcb125f46_a-6cbc1281-c66d-3d01-8f8f-082e4d3fdc71","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-bc2f3557-e6a4-3142-8585-ba0fcb125f46_a-6cbc1281-c66d-3d01-8f8f-082e4d3fdc71","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/ready-north-korea-b-52-xydx5fy","author":"third_watch","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/ready-north-korea-b-52-124100092.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ymzcokpW.kYO6B.eyPMtYA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/c4cb78082f6c61a74347327ccf74471c","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/80tfqvIxsdESAziGdHxzUg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04MTA7dz0xNDQwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/c4cb78082f6c61a74347327ccf74471c","height":810,"width":1440,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/c4cb78082f6c61a74347327ccf74471c","imgw":1440,"imgh":810,"title":"Get Ready, North Korea: The B-52 Will Soon Be Able to Drop Even More Bombs","summary":"Known for massive bombing missions during the Vietnam War, the 159-foot long\u00a0B-52s\u00a0have in recent years been operating over Afghanistan in support of military actions there from a base in Guam.

North Koreans annoyed with Kim Jong Un photographs","summary":"Dec. 18 (UPI) -- Kim Jong Un may enjoy being photographed frequently, but his desire to be at the center of state media attention may be irritating ordinary North Koreans. Kim's recurring presence in North Korean newspapers like the Rodong Sinmun now means major state visits must be commemorated with dozens of Kim photographs per issue, Daily NK reported Monday. On Dec. 9 Kim's visit to Samjiyon in Yanggang Province was announced in the newspaper with 60 photographs from the location, with 50 out of the 60 pictures including Kim. The attention-seeking Kim is drawing criticism from North Koreans, who say he is trying to repair his image following the execution of his uncle-in-law Jang Song Taek.","published_at":1513691198,"content_id":"631dcb05-b997-3dbc-b294-2f70da77049a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/World-News\/2017\/12\/18\/Report-North-Koreans-annoyed-with-Kim-Jong-Un-photographs\/2721513620280\/","content_published_at":1513621492,"content_time":1513621492,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-eb87d305-a271-3839-8eef-81e8f4b51471_a-619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-eb87d305-a271-3839-8eef-81e8f4b51471_a-619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-eb87d305-a271-3839-8eef-81e8f4b51471_a-619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"UPI","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/World-News\/2017\/12\/18\/North-Korean-official-in-charge-of-nuclear-facilities-reportedly-executed\/2561513650935\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j8vfD.qAi1_tEd5LwtG5Dg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nX9aBkDG.sfpKFflBWXk6A--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266--840721861.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6y8jBQPZ4bH8EfMK45pjUA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTg7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nX9aBkDG.sfpKFflBWXk6A--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266--840721861.jpeg","height":398,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nX9aBkDG.sfpKFflBWXk6A--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_619d1371-ae67-37d0-a5b8-bc5beb755266--840721861.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":398,"title":"North Korean official in charge of nuclear facilities reportedly executed","summary":"SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 18 (UPI) -- A senior North Korean official in charge of construction works on nuclear facilities is believed to have been executed, Asahi Shimbun reported Tuesday.

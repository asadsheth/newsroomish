The navy chief, Adm. Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin, said the boat was intercepted after it entered Malaysian waters and was moored off the northern resort island of Langkawi. The boat had stopped temporarily Sunday in southern Thailand, where it underwent repairs and was resupplied with fuel and food before being sent on its way to Malaysia, as its passengers reportedly desired. About 700,000 Rohingya have fled western Myanmar's Rakhine state to neighboring Bangladesh in the past seven months to escape a brutal counterinsurgency campaign by Myanmar's army.","published_at":1522728371,"content_id":"218a9cd6-1153-30a2-be6b-baf627d9b78a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/top-asian-news-4-02-m-gmt-040225584.html","content_published_at":1522785313,"content_time":1522785313,"content_relative_time":1,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":1,"comment_relative_time":1,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c6c74dc2-f233-3906-9b6d-b5ac3035ca7c_a-75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c6c74dc2-f233-3906-9b6d-b5ac3035ca7c_a-75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c6c74dc2-f233-3906-9b6d-b5ac3035ca7c_a-75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca","author":"third_watch","provider":"UPI","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/World-News\/2018\/04\/03\/North-Korean-diplomat-reaching-out-to-China-Russia-ahead-of-inter-Korean-summit\/9801522752364\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FfmBAAWafgo.H6diBpDaHg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jvwlAdDQY6GPSBB73hAnuA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca--1660300610.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RGeSMC6bj.L_MJBCLOhoGA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTk7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jvwlAdDQY6GPSBB73hAnuA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca--1660300610.jpeg","height":399,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jvwlAdDQY6GPSBB73hAnuA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_75896094-42d6-345f-8d0e-bf3a776f30ca--1660300610.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":399,"title":"North Korean diplomat reaching out to China, Russia ahead of inter-Korean summit","summary":"SEOUL, April 3 (UPI) -- North Korea appears to be attempting to bolster ties with key countries, ahead of leader Kim Jong Un's upcoming summits with South Korea and the United States.

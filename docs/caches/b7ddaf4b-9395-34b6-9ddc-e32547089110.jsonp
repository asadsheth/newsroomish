This will no doubt be one of the most important days of both of their lives\u00a0\u2013 yet, while it marks the first day of her marriage to the prince, it will not be the first time Meghan Markle has walked down the aisle. The former Suits actress was previously married to Trevor Engelson, a 41 year-old movie producer from\u00a0Great Neck, New York. Their marriage reportedly ended abruptly\u00a0and he is currently working on a pilot episode about an ex marrying a royal \u2013 but what else do we know about him? Who is Trevor Engelson? Mr Engelson\u00a0was born on the north shore of Long Island,\u00a0New York on October 23, 1976.\u00a0He is currently a film producer and talent manager in Los Angeles after getting his start in the movie industry\u00a0as a production assistant. Engelson produced\u00a0License to Wed, starring Robin Williams, and 2009's\u00a0All About Steve; but he is perhaps most well known\u00a0for producing\u00a0Remember Me, a 2010\u00a0tearjerker starring Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin. Meghan Markle had a cameo role in the film, playing a character called Megan. As boss of \u00a0Underground Management, Engelson also manages screenwriters, actors, novelists, and film directors. Engelson's marriage to Ms Markle Meghan was 23 years-old when she met her ex-husband. They reportedly started dating back in 2004, marrying\u00a0after seven years together. Engelson married the Suits actress on September 10 2011 at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.\u00a0The wedding was a four-day affair and took place in front of 102 guests. Meghan landed her role in Suits just a few months before they married. However\u00a0sustaining a long-distance marriage was apparently too difficult for the couple; Ms\u00a0Markle and Engelson separated after two years. Their divorce was finalised in August 2013, with the couple citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Engelson has not spoken about\u00a0his ex-wife's new relationship but Ms\u00a0Markle's half-brother Thomas Markle Jnr. blamed their divorce\u00a0on 'the pressure of Hollywood'. Days until the Royal wedding One source told Woman's Day magazine that it was her job filming the Suits and the resulting the long-distance\u00a0situation that ultimately ruined their\u00a0relationship. The insider said:\u00a0\"They really battled with long distances. Trevor was based in LA while Meghan was in Toronto, a five-hour flight away.\u00a0It was a very difficult way to start married life.\" In his controversial new book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, Royal biographer Andrew Morton revealed that Ms. Markle returned \u00a0her wedding and engagement rings to Engelson by registered post\u00a0after ending their marriage \u201cout of the blue\u201d. \u201c[Engelson] went from cherishing Meghan to, as one friend observed, \u2018Feeling like he was a piece of something stuck to the bottom of her shoe\u2019,\u201d Morton wrote. \u201cWhether she wanted to admit it to herself or not, Meghan, who once said she couldn\u2019t imagine life without Trevor by her side, was now building a new world for herself.\u201d Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features grid Engelson's latest project? A divorce-themed Royal rom-com Engelson's most recent project has been an\u00a0upcoming television remake of Heathers based on the 1988 film of the same name. Yet the movie trade website\u00a0Deadline Hollywood\u00a0announced in September 2017 that Fox was\u00a0developing a pilot with Engelson for a story that centres around the story of man whose wife leaves him for a British prince. This was the pitch: \"Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London\u2019s tabloid media, is next level.\" The pair did not have children together\u00a0and the lead characters of the proposed new series\u00a0are not based on their lives. However\u00a0Deadline did say\u00a0the comedy's idea originated after Trevor had a conversation with fellow producer Dan about what might have happened had he shared custody of children with the Royal Family. Prince Harry And Meghan Markle attend the UK team trials for the Invictus Games in April Credit: Samir Hussein Executives at Fox have signed\u00a0Modern Family executive producer Danny Zuker to write\u00a0and a British director, Christine Gernon, to direct. Deadline also reported that the pilot show had sold for what is\u00a0\u201cbelieved to be the biggest commitment for a comedy pitch at the network so far this season.\" While it\u00a0is not clear when filming would begin, one thing is for sure: it is guaranteed to attract audiences and headlines when it does appear on screens.","published_at":1526471981,"content_id":"46c70224-6785-35c7-921a-4beb7d99666a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/meghan-markle-apos-first-husband-145443849.html","content_published_at":1526479500,"content_time":1526479500,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-b0bd0497-aec5-303d-a955-f81b1abdd655_a-4c2e9ba2-7fe3-36b2-ba34-ea96aa76eb5b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/wife-former-us-open-champ-561eot2","author":"nanook","provider":"KTRK \u2013 Houston","provider_url":"http:\/\/abclocal.go.com\/ktrk\/index","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/10\/25\/ktrk-44x70-png_145514.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/wife-former-us-open-champ-211113208.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rSaWhN6ltZrA.YyifsAvfA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.krtk.abc.news.com\/88681ccacfa76d7969f7170dbf452b13","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tnN4si7K.Kw.HoX4QEX2_Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.krtk.abc.news.com\/88681ccacfa76d7969f7170dbf452b13","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.krtk.abc.news.com\/88681ccacfa76d7969f7170dbf452b13","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Wife of former US Open champ Lucas Glover accused of hitting husband and his mother after he misses cut","summary":null,"published_at":1526436944,"content_id":"4c2e9ba2-7fe3-36b2-ba34-ea96aa76eb5b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/wife-former-us-open-champ-211113208.html","content_published_at":1526419464,"content_time":1526419464,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110","content_type":"video_link","aspect":1.7800000000000000266453525910037569701671600341796875},{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-a81504df-82a8-3c00-92e5-76ef8742e5c0_a-fa761c3b-2dcc-308f-8c8a-60e8a4823f1d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-a81504df-82a8-3c00-92e5-76ef8742e5c0_a-fa761c3b-2dcc-308f-8c8a-60e8a4823f1d","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Sports","provider_url":"http:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-18\/c8fc4ff0-94e1-11e6-b7d8-cd4d526f3e67_US-Sports.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/ethan-hawke-quit-knicks-fan-stopped-getting-free-tickets-230959289.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZHwmUTHd2qAsH.dEFXStJA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/0ea3ffcc7ae0e15610ad27f162118c1c","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l7rEj5usL8O5afBinQ0oCw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/0ea3ffcc7ae0e15610ad27f162118c1c","height":2000,"width":3000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/0ea3ffcc7ae0e15610ad27f162118c1c","imgw":3000,"imgh":2000,"title":"Ethan Hawke quit being a Knicks fan when he stopped getting free tickets","summary":"Ethan Hawke enjoys what presumably is a free court-side seat at a New York Knicks game in 2007.

American gossip website TMZ claim to have talked to the former actress' father who is said to be recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week. It is claimed Meghan, 36, tried to contact her father on Monday, but that he was away from his phone. She followed it up with a text, according to TMZ, saying she loved him and that there were no ill feelings.\u00a0 He told the website: \"I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle. Of course I'd walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I'd like to be a part of history.\"\u00a0 Mr Markle is said to insisted if doctors allow him to leave his bed, he will risk his health to fly to England before Saturday. The American former actress's half-sister, Samantha Markle, said she hoped Thomas Markle would be at the ceremony, but that he had faced an \"unbelievable amount of stress\". She told Good Morning Britain that Mr Markle had health issues, \u00a0had had chest pains and had suffered a heart attack. But it was not clear whether doctors had diagnosed a need for medical emergency. \"I think he wants to go to the hospital and get checked out,\" she said. \"I don't know as of today what his plans are, but there's a very real concern. I wanted to see him go (to the wedding), I didn't want him deprived of that. \"But clearly the priority should be whether or not it's safe for him to do that. That's where we're at.\" Markle family Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the nuptials at Windsor Castle. Celebrity website TMZ claimed Mr Markle had initially decided not to go to the wedding for fear of embarrassing his daughter following the fallout from the pictures. Kensington Palace declined to confirm whether\u00a0Mr Markle had pulled out of attending but appealed for understanding. A palace spokesman said: \"This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. \"She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.\" Samantha Markle defended Mr Markle, saying he had been pressurised into a dangerous situation because of press intrusion. \"He was living a very quiet, peaceful life, not as a recluse. He's a very intelligent man. He's been gregarious and worked in entertainment for 40 years,\" she said. \"He had spoken with press and was doing just that, but when he called me, panicking on the freeway because he's in a dangerous situation being followed by seven or eight cars, I think there have been examples in history of how dangerous that can be.\" Royal wedding countdown in pictures as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's preparations begin She earlier attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she tweeted that it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as \"positive photos\" in a bid to combat his \"bad\" portrayal in the press, but insisted it was not done for money. Pictures published earlier this month in newspapers and websites showed Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding-related activities such as being fitted for a suit, apparently unaware he was being snapped. The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported that the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress's father in the internet cafe with a photographer. Royal wedding PREMIUM GRID The former TV lighting director was due to meet the Queen and other royals with Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, this week ahead of the wedding. Meghan's father met her mother on the set of the US soap General Hospital, where he worked as a lighting director when she was a temp in the studio. They divorced when Meghan was six. Ms Ragland is being tipped to step in and accompany her daughter down the aisle if Mr Markle does not attend. Meghan's extended family arrive in London - without invites Meghan Markle's extended family arrived in London with seemingly no invite to the big day.\u00a0 With the constant speculation over whether or not her father would attend the ceremony,\u00a0her nephews' arrival with their mother heaps more embarrassment on the American actress, 36. Tracy Dooley - who was married to Meghan Markle's half-brother\u00a0Thomas Markle Jr - was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25,\u00a0and Thomas, 26. Ms Dooley\u00a0has previously told ITV's Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday, admitting she had not seen Ms Markle for 20 years. She is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she \"will be in the front row cheering them on\" in Windsor. The Dooleys took to Facebook to announce their presence in the capital on Monday evening. Meghan Markle's nephews Tyler and Thomas Dooley and their mother Tracy Dooley Markle arrive at Heathrow airport with an unidentified woman Credit: Constant Media Ms Dooley posted pictures of landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye, writing: \"We're here.\u00a0Yay.\" Her son Tyler uploaded an image of the Imperial War Museum, as well as a photograph of the inside of a hotel room. \"Just touched down in London. Man,\u00a0what a journey so far,\" he wrote. \"We're safe and sound.\" Ms Dooley lives in Medford, Oregon, according to her Facebook, but is originally from Calabasas in California.\u00a0 She is listed as a creative advertising and marketing specialist at Opus Broadcasting - a company responsible for a handful of radio stations, according to its website.\u00a0 On May 3, she shared a link to her personal blog, saying she was travelling to London to \"cover all things Royal wedding\". Upon the family's arrival, the Facebook blog page - called Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles - posted a picture of the trio landing at Heathrow with the caption: \"Just glad to have landed safely and hoping for Tom senior to be well, healthy and\u00a0happy. \"I wish the same for Meghan, Prince Harry, my children, friends, family and those who need our prayers and love. Peace, love and good works.\" In April, the blog's page, which appears to be run by Ms Dooley, shared an article headlined \"Meghan Markle snubs nephew and his\u00a0mum with no invite to Royal wedding.\" It was accompanied with the caption: \"Beyond blessed to be any part of this momentous occasion.\u00a0We'll be front and center at Windsor cheering Meghan and Prince Harry on.\" \u00a0","published_at":1526407256,"content_id":"211a730c-0ba1-3ba0-9bc1-c8bf50ae0a34","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/meghan-markle-apos-extended-family-095314430.html","content_published_at":1526401492,"content_time":1526401492,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-de1b7fa8-22a6-3820-b7d8-8d7299fb71dc_a-ab7a2c4c-409d-3ac8-a60d-a355d3f21dd7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-de1b7fa8-22a6-3820-b7d8-8d7299fb71dc_a-ab7a2c4c-409d-3ac8-a60d-a355d3f21dd7","author":"nanook","provider":"Yahoo Sports Videos","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.sports.yahoo.com\/","provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/prince-william-might-leave-prince-175053653.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Y4OAhXSljq7aMcWQYyf8tQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-169422-1526406564635.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TY3m57JHPX3._x804OpWPA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjgwO3c9NzIwOw--\/https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-169422-1526406564635.jpg","height":1280,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/giraffe-169422-1526406564635.jpg","imgw":720,"imgh":1280,"title":"Prince William might leave Prince Harry's wedding early to watch the FA Cup final","summary":null,"published_at":1526406756,"content_id":"ab7a2c4c-409d-3ac8-a60d-a355d3f21dd7","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/prince-william-might-leave-prince-175053653.html","content_published_at":1526406653,"content_time":1526406653,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110","content_type":"video_link","aspect":0.560000000000000053290705182007513940334320068359375},{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-9a24f1bb-13c5-3c61-84be-353c30ceaa2d_a-4e9a114e-9e32-3782-a5b4-5344f07bd0ae","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-9a24f1bb-13c5-3c61-84be-353c30ceaa2d_a-4e9a114e-9e32-3782-a5b4-5344f07bd0ae","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Entertainment Tonight","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.etonline.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-12\/5d3d7a20-25f7-11e8-a583-35df99676a72_et.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/nikki-bella-says-she-only-175210783.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bh8bM.BL7VfUUyWTTGujwA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/d.yimg.com\/hd\/cbstv\/5\/7\/data_xE2t9FzGbwz3b4uXDd_t-fcybvJCeICo1ew7B6JRAHiXE2xuQXr-YXKY7XYxea2Xy7iD2RttLGU-~A_2_0.jpg?s=cf83b5db6e262ad32a4a913195ad4770&c=c79f7e8c20b99c121bcb4f15e8d29e16&a=cbstv&mr=0","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oN8nckE9EOomlkwiE9ESrQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/http:\/\/d.yimg.com\/hd\/cbstv\/5\/7\/data_xE2t9FzGbwz3b4uXDd_t-fcybvJCeICo1ew7B6JRAHiXE2xuQXr-YXKY7XYxea2Xy7iD2RttLGU-~A_2_0.jpg?s=cf83b5db6e262ad32a4a913195ad4770&c=c79f7e8c20b99c121bcb4f15e8d29e16&a=cbstv&mr=0","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/d.yimg.com\/hd\/cbstv\/5\/7\/data_xE2t9FzGbwz3b4uXDd_t-fcybvJCeICo1ew7B6JRAHiXE2xuQXr-YXKY7XYxea2Xy7iD2RttLGU-~A_2_0.jpg?s=cf83b5db6e262ad32a4a913195ad4770&c=c79f7e8c20b99c121bcb4f15e8d29e16&a=cbstv&mr=0","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Nikki Bella Says She Only Shared a Bed With John Cena '30 Days Total Out of 6 Months' Prior to Split","summary":"In a new clip from the all-new episode of 'Total Bellas,' the wrestler admits she was feeling 'lonely' before calling it quits from her fiance.","published_at":1526406730,"content_id":"4e9a114e-9e32-3782-a5b4-5344f07bd0ae","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/nikki-bella-says-she-only-175210783.html","content_published_at":1526406730,"content_time":1526406730,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

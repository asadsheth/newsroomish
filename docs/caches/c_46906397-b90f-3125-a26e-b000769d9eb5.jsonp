The franchise is about to release its biggest movie to date, but before that happens, some of Marvel's biggest stars want to thank those that made it possible. Of course, in this case, the people truly responsible are the fans and a new video includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and others, as they thank those that have supported Marvel movies for the last 10 years. The character wasn't the biggest name in comic books and the actor, Robert Downey Jr., wasn't a massive star, but the film was a huge hit and its success led to the decision to take a little post-credits scene starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and expand on it to create an interconnected series of films that existed within the same universe, just as comic books had been doing for decades.","published_at":1523380608,"content_id":"d6082dd3-749e-3611-b63c-3679eb761291","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2400571\/robert-downey-jr-and-more-marvel-actors-thank-fans-in-10-year-tribute-video","content_published_at":1523380227,"content_time":1523380227,"content_relative_time":18,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":18,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"17e6ec19-02e2-38a1-9e52-b22d3cd0ebac","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-70760f78-792e-3ba9-877b-8cc64d10ad27_a-17e6ec19-02e2-38a1-9e52-b22d3cd0ebac","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-70760f78-792e-3ba9-877b-8cc64d10ad27_a-17e6ec19-02e2-38a1-9e52-b22d3cd0ebac","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/cool-throwback-wedding-photo-el-ryyvquy","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"CINEMABLEND","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2400472\/the-cool-throwback-wedding-photo-el-james-shared-from-the-set-of-fifty-shades-freed","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dc.n2SNFmfLxBThq40YG5A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RU2GEzg48GQx9bWZaus4zQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_17e6ec19-02e2-38a1-9e52-b22d3cd0ebac--1866178256.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yy5VJtSZbbtzBra4pV_OhQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RU2GEzg48GQx9bWZaus4zQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_17e6ec19-02e2-38a1-9e52-b22d3cd0ebac--1866178256.jpeg","height":300,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RU2GEzg48GQx9bWZaus4zQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_17e6ec19-02e2-38a1-9e52-b22d3cd0ebac--1866178256.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":300,"title":"The Cool Throwback Wedding Photo E.L.

We're only halfway through 2018.\u00a0 That's just the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Considering the cultural impact of its comic books, shows, rides at Disney's theme parks, and endless merchandise, is it really a surprise that people are naming their kids after Marvel characters?\u00a0 SEE ALSO: At least one Marvel favorite didn't die horribly in 'Avengers: Infinity War' The U.S. Social Security Administration released data from the 1,000 most popular baby names in 2017. Among the typical Emmas, Masons, and Olivias, there are some pretty unusual names that you might recognize from theaters, from Banner to Hawkeye.\u00a0 Here are some Marvel-inspired names, from most to least popular: Parker:\u00a0 1,487 female, 4,346 male There are 5,833 babies born in 2017 who share a name with Peter Parker, an awkward high schooler by day and Spiderman by night.\u00a0 Wade:\u00a0 899 male After being horribly disfigured by and gaining mutant powers from an experimental cancer treatment, Wade Wilson drops his given name for something more fitting: Deadpool. Sadly, Deadpool wasn't one of the top 1,000 baby names last year, but Wade was! Natasha:\u00a0 355 female To be fair, Natasha is already a pretty common name even without Marvel's influence. But we'd like to think that 2,602 babies were named after Natasha Romanova, better known as Black Widow. When is this badass Avenger getting her own movie? Pepper:\u00a0 121 female, 7 male\u00a0 Pepper Potts is Iron Man's fianc\u00e9e and most of the time, his voice of reason. She also shares a name with 128 children born in 2017. It's a pretty cute name.\u00a0 Loki:\u00a0 5 female, 91 male Yes, 96 babies were actually named Loki. Not family pets, but actual children. We don't have an explanation for this, either. \u00a0 Valkyrie:\u00a0 63 female OK, this name sounds ridiculous but think of all of the nicknames you could get from Valkyrie: Val, Kyrie, Elite Asgardian Warrior ... the possibilities are endless! After all, who wouldn't want to be named after a fearless alien fighter? Marvel:\u00a0 21 female, 29 male 50 kids born in 2017 were actually named Marvel. On the plus side, those 50 kids don't have to wait for Halloween to dress up as their favorite characters \u2014 they get to be Marvel superheroes all year long. Banner:\u00a0 39 male 39 little boys were named Banner last year. Are all of them tributes to Bruce Banner, the Incredible Hulk? Probably not, but we like to think that some of those parents are fans of the lovable (even if prone to angry outbursts) scientist. Rocket:\u00a0 9 female, 28 male The feisty little raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy makes is clear that he's not some cute pet, from his vulgar language to his killer aim. A whopping 37 kids were named Rocket last year \u2014 if they couldn't be named Groot, then Rocket will have to do.\u00a0 Cage:\u00a0 23 male\u00a0 Luke Cage is Harlem's reluctant protector, dodging bullets with his inhuman strength. Twenty three male babies shared a name with Cage last year. Since season two is coming to Netflix in June, will more people name their kid after the hoodie-clad hero? Quill: 5 female, 15 male Although Starlord wasn't in the top 1,000 names, the Guardian's human name Peter was very popular. His last name, Quill, was also given to 20 kids born last year. \u00a0 Drax:\u00a0 11 male Nothing says \"adorable baby boy\" like the image of a massive blue and red alien bodybuilder, right? Eleven children were actually named Drax last year. Yeah, it's a lot.\u00a0 Nebula:\u00a0 10 female Even though there weren't any Gamoras in the top 1,000 names, Nebula is a pretty cool namesake. Sure, she dabbles with evil forces and has the most twisted relationship with her sister, but she can fight. \u00a0 Hawkeye:\u00a0 6 male\u00a0 Six actual kids were named Hawkeye in 2017. Six. For the sake of these six children, we hope the archer\/Avenger gets his own movie. Or Netflix series. Seriously, you can't let down these six kids! What Marvel-inspired names will 2018 bring? Black Panther names like T'Challa and Shuri will probably be popular, but if there are any baby Thanoses running around, good luck humanity!

Cinematic Universe or are more fantasy-oriented like the Wizarding World. Universal Pictures was eager to get in on that kind of blockbuster action, and today marks the one-year anniversary that the Dark Universe was officially announced. Much like in the Golden Age of Hollywood, the Dark Universe would see the studio's classic monsters, like Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man, occupying the same world, and The Mummy kicked off the whole initiative. While it hasn't been officially announced that it's been scrapped, it certainly doesn't have the same driving energy it once had, and we can presumably thank The Mummy's disappointing theatrical performance for that.","published_at":1527030181,"content_id":"7c2f471b-2a4a-354d-aefc-e85b242180ff","content_url":"https:\/\/amp.cinemablend.com\/news\/2423971\/its-been-one-year-since-the-dark-universe-was-announced-so-what-happened","content_published_at":1527029707,"content_time":1527029707,"content_relative_time":44,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":44,"comment_relative_time":44,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"40125a62-9000-3bea-8e37-a3a53db6e6b3","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-4010ff2e-22c8-3d7e-a6d0-80dfb1589e9b_a-40125a62-9000-3bea-8e37-a3a53db6e6b3","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-4010ff2e-22c8-3d7e-a6d0-80dfb1589e9b_a-40125a62-9000-3bea-8e37-a3a53db6e6b3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/krypton-phantom-zone-29960ej","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Internet Video Archive","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/krypton-phantom-zone-205500157.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ldf9TNzZ2n0ntZstlSqxng--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.internetvideoarchive.com\/1a1bc6cbd4fb9c10eedecfcd929b1416","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8oEMUCx1Bdd3uF69gVEpCw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDA7dz0zMjA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.internetvideoarchive.com\/1a1bc6cbd4fb9c10eedecfcd929b1416","height":240,"width":320,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.internetvideoarchive.com\/1a1bc6cbd4fb9c10eedecfcd929b1416","imgw":320,"imgh":240,"title":"Krypton: The Phantom Zone","summary":null,"published_at":1527024673,"content_id":"40125a62-9000-3bea-8e37-a3a53db6e6b3","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/krypton-phantom-zone-205500157.html","content_published_at":1527022500,"content_time":1527022500,"content_relative_time":46,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"video_link","aspect":1.7800000000000000266453525910037569701671600341796875},"created_at":0,"comment_time":46,"comment_relative_time":46,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

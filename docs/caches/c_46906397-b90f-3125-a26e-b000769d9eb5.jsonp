Starting as a spiritual successor to Point Break in 2001, the franchise has grown from a grounded and gritty street-level crime thriller in The Fast and the Furious to a global espionage blockbuster franchise in 2017's The Fate of the Furious. It's a change that has not gone unnoticed by original Fast and Furious director Rob Cohen, and the filmmaker recently opened up in an interview and explained that he's just happy to see original characters remain at the heart of the enhanced spectacle. The franchise went from a Los Angeles story built around a family of multicultural brothers and sisters to what I'll call 'pure spectacle.'

Hollywood, and its onlookers, was certainly in need of a wholesome good news story. But one star cut through the gloom: six-year-old Maisie Sly, a deaf girl from Swindon who was behind the ceremony\u2019s most touching moment. Rachel Shenton, writer and actress of 2017 film The Silent Child, signed her acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film Oscar so that Sly could understand it. \u201cOur movie is about a deaf child being born into a world of silence,\u201d Shenton explained, with shaking hands. It's not exaggerated or sensationalised, this is happening: millions of children all over the world live in silence and face communication barriers, particularly in access to education.\" Hours earlier, Sly dazzled as the littlest person on the red carpet in a smart midnight blue dress, a matching bow across her blonde hair, arriving at the 90th Academy Awards\u00a0hand-in-hand with Shenton and her fiance, Chris Overton, who directed the film. Sly was five when she played Libby, a four-year-old who was born into a hearing family. Libby\u2019s parents and siblings are a normal family, but unwittingly shut out their deaf daughter, who spent her early years in confounding silence. After remaining undiagnosed for three-and-a-half years, audiences watch as an angry and introverted Libby is coaxed out of herself after a social worker, Joanne (played by Shenton) is brought in to teach her British Sign Language. Fortunately, Sly\u2019s own story differs greatly: both her parents are deaf, as is her older brother Jack, eight, and little sister Chloe. Like her siblings, Sly learned BSL from infancy. But for her father, Gibson, Libby\u2019s experiences are all too relatable. He was also born to a hearing family and wasn\u2019t diagnosed until he was three. He later attended a mainstream primary school. \u201cI was lonely, frustrated and rebellious,\u201d he told the Swindon Advertiser last year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I met Elizabeth and learned BSL that I found my deaf identity.\u201d As Shenton said, the problem of deaf integration is widespread. Every week 34 babies are born deaf in the UK, and 90 per cent of them have hearing parents. \u201cThe Silent Child shines a light on the challenges and injustices that too many deaf children experience as part of their daily lives,\u201d Susan Daniels, Chief Executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, told The Telegraph. The whole Sly family accompanied the six-year-old to Los Angeles for Sunday night\u2019s ceremony. It is her second trip to America in the past 12 months, after Sly made her maiden voyage over the Atlantic to see the film premiere at the Rhode Island International Film Festival during her summer holidays. Sly won Best Actress at the festival, which made The Silent Child eligible to enter the Oscars. The film\u2019s Facebook page shows how the family have been enjoying Los Angeles\u2019 landmarks over the past two weeks, with trips to Universal Studios, the Los Angeles Zoo and a stroll down Hollywood Walk of Fame. Sly and Shenton in The Silent Child It\u2019s all a rapid change for the \u201cbubbly\u201d schoolgirl, who attends Red Oaks Primary School \u2013 which is a mainstream school with a special resource provision for deaf children \u2013 near her home of Upper Stratton. \u201cShe\u2019s a lovely girl,\u201d said headteacher Rachel Surch. \u201cShe\u2019s a real character, with lots of personality and lots of friends. Just like our other deaf children, she fits right in with her mainstream friends - being deaf doesn\u2019t hold her back, nor should it.\u201d Red Oaks celebrated The Silent Child by hosting a red carpet premiere for its pupils in the school hall. Speaking the morning after the film\u2019s Oscar win, Surch said it had \u201cbeen a bit of a whirlwind\u201d. Sly was part of a nationwide casting search for The Silent Child, and auditioned after her parents saw an advert on Facebook looking for a four- or five-year-old girl who was profoundly deaf and used sign language. Shenton said that 100 children auditioned, but she and the production team knew Sly was their star instantly. \"Maisie walked in and we all say, all our production team, that we made our decision within 10 seconds, she was just perfect,\" she told Good Morning Britain. The Oscar-winner fell in love with British Sign Language during her teens, after her father lost his hearing as a result of undergoing chemotherapy. He spent the last two years of his life deaf, and died when Shenton was 14. She was driven to juggle her nascent acting career \u2013 which included roles in TV dramas such as Holby City and Waterloo Road \u2013 with volunteering as a BSL interpreter and working with a local charity for deaf people. The stories of people she met inspired her to write The Silent Child, especially those of middle-class families who were left dumbfounded upon having a deaf child. Sly has now joined the ranks of Marlee Matlin, who became the first deaf actress \u2013 and the youngest women ever \u2013 to win Best Actress at the 1986 Oscars for Children of a Lesser God. \u201cShe is a confident, happy little girl and maybe she could be the next Matlin,\u201d Gibson said last May. \u201cBut we do know that acting opportunity for a deaf girl are few and far between.\u201d The Silent Child writer and star Rachel Shenton, actress Maisie Sly and director Chris Overton Credit: \u00a0CARLO ALLEGRI The lack of deaf actors on screen was another major motivation for Shenton to make The Silent Child: \u201cI\u2019ve seen numerous projects where hearing people are cast to play deaf roles,\u201d she said on Good Morning Britain. The problem has frequently found the silver screen, such as when Tammy Blanchard played the wife of Matt Damon\u2019s character in The Good Shepherd (2006), or James Stewart\u2019s role as the deaf George Bailey in It\u2019s A Wonderful Life. But change could be on the horizon. October will see the release of Wonderstruck, Todd Haynes\u2019 adaptation of Brian Selznick\u2019s time-travelling coming of age novel, which sees 14-year-old deaf actress Millie Simmonds take a major part. After Sly\u2019s success, who knows which other deaf children may be inspired to follow her lead. As Daniels says: \u201cFor deaf children across the globe, this film, its story, and its talented leading lady all show there is no limit to what deaf children can achieve.\u201d","published_at":1520399175,"content_id":"bc7656d6-8ac9-3a20-b6f8-c2ee33fe074c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/oscars-shine-light-maisie-profoundly-084740427.html","content_published_at":1520264475,"content_time":1520264475,"content_relative_time":56,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":56,"comment_relative_time":56,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"76dd456b-b4f0-3314-8cb8-254f0aa4d513","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-3de3f2b4-71b9-31ef-9fc0-0be9cbfbab81_a-76dd456b-b4f0-3314-8cb8-254f0aa4d513","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-3de3f2b4-71b9-31ef-9fc0-0be9cbfbab81_a-76dd456b-b4f0-3314-8cb8-254f0aa4d513","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/china-sets-one-month-box-2jnm2x7","author":"nanook","provider":"Deadline","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/china-sets-one-month-box-155033082.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eJHazdzouO1cR8jrcbjQYw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/006d7996b4b0d4fcf5ffc713756997d5","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PUYjelpZT9WAWwEUDTCBmg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjc7dz05NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/006d7996b4b0d4fcf5ffc713756997d5","height":627,"width":940,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/006d7996b4b0d4fcf5ffc713756997d5","imgw":940,"imgh":627,"title":"China Sets One-Month Box Office Record With $1.6B February","summary":"While the February box office in North America cleared $1B for the first time, the Chinese box office set a new global one-month record at $1.6B (RMB 10.14B) in the same period.

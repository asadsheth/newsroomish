Fortson is reprising Cassie Lang later this year in Ant-Man and the Wasp, but according to That Hashtag Show, Emma Fuhrmann, whose credits include The Good Guys, The Fandango Sisters and Blended, is playing Cassie for some scenes in Avengers 4. What makes this more interesting than your average recasting is that Fuhrmann is 16 years old, while Fortson is 10 years old. So if Fuhrmann has indeed been cast as Cassie, that means we'll be seeing a teenaged version of her, and thus that Avengers 4 doesn't pick up immediately","published_at":1524094320,"content_id":"6f626d31-cad5-314f-b81a-20b6b73ac000","content_url":"https:\/\/amp.cinemablend.com\/news\/2405252\/avengers-4-casting-rumor-raises-a-big-question-about-when-the-story-takes-place","content_published_at":1524093587,"content_time":1524093587,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":22,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b5642bcf-7690-3854-8205-ebf1672aba83","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-624151ea-89f3-376a-9089-4c13bc5df896_a-b5642bcf-7690-3854-8205-ebf1672aba83","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-624151ea-89f3-376a-9089-4c13bc5df896_a-b5642bcf-7690-3854-8205-ebf1672aba83","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/civil-war-initially-had-bigger-1p62sbr","author":"nanook","provider":"We Got This Covered","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/wegotthiscovered.com\/movies\/captain-america-civil-war-bigger-role-frozen-soldiers\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WAqqE5cSLs3PTJ2BhABKFA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZEzfIRSIvlgHTPJJGmqwtg--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NTUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b5642bcf-7690-3854-8205-ebf1672aba83--1983187258.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/r3kqnFTE3xllCPNBE5HgMw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTA7dz0xMTAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZEzfIRSIvlgHTPJJGmqwtg--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NTUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b5642bcf-7690-3854-8205-ebf1672aba83--1983187258.jpeg","height":550,"width":1100,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZEzfIRSIvlgHTPJJGmqwtg--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NTUwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b5642bcf-7690-3854-8205-ebf1672aba83--1983187258.jpeg","imgw":1100,"imgh":550,"title":"Civil War Initially Had A Bigger Role For The Frozen Winter Soldiers","summary":"Though the airport fight scene between the assembled Team Cap and Team Iron Man grabs all the attention, the final \u2013 and more emotional \u2013 action sequence of\u00a0Captain America: Civil War\u00a0is the climactic battle between Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark, as the latter attempts to murder Barnes after finding out he killed his parents.

The Russian proposal did not specify where the rebels would go, but the terms echo previous evacuation deals under which insurgents have ceded ground to Assad and departed to opposition-held territory in the north near the Turkish border.","published_at":1520321595,"content_id":"019db6fb-be23-30f3-8341-447f1d179de1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/russia-offers-rebels-safe-passage-syrias-eastern-ghouta-073440790.html","content_published_at":1520363433,"content_time":1520363433,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-e8f678d7-0a73-3415-8467-02e16db9f427_a-352f4d4b-6648-3fa1-ba08-e915866782eb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-e8f678d7-0a73-3415-8467-02e16db9f427_a-352f4d4b-6648-3fa1-ba08-e915866782eb","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/syria-regime-forces-control-third-ghouta-enclave-monitor-093139085.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/25y7gQhfKsKVB6X8yqdxrw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/5d5ec3ba15dc9b991476373ff4ac9b00ed9ac528.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8C7I86TtjumPj6hM.RHAZQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MTA7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/5d5ec3ba15dc9b991476373ff4ac9b00ed9ac528.jpg","height":710,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/5d5ec3ba15dc9b991476373ff4ac9b00ed9ac528.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":710,"title":"Syria regime forces control third of Ghouta enclave: monitor","summary":"Syrian regime and allied forces pushed deeper into Eastern Ghouta on Monday and have now retaken a third of the rebel enclave, a monitor said. \"Regime forces now control 33 percent, or a third, of besieged Eastern Ghouta,\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said. \"Regime forces are advancing at a high pace because operations so far are mostly conducted in farmland,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Observatory.","published_at":1520290264,"content_id":"352f4d4b-6648-3fa1-ba08-e915866782eb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/syria-regime-forces-control-third-ghouta-enclave-monitor-093139085.html","content_published_at":1520242299,"content_time":1520242299,"content_relative_time":37,"reaction_count":63,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

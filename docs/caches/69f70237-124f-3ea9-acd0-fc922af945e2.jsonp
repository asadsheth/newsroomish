The ZANU-PF party congress officially endorsed its Central Committee's decision to replace Mugabe with Emmerson Mnangagwa as its leader, and it endorsed Mnangagwa as its candidate for the 2018 elections. Mnangagwa was inaugurated as the country's new president last month, with the immediate challenge of reviving a shattered economy and removing himself from his longtime mentor's shadow. Friday's meeting was the final step in Mugabe's fall from grace after the military put him under house arrest, hundreds of thousands rallied in the streets and lawmakers began impeachment proceedings.","published_at":1513352789,"content_id":"2c4c88a5-393c-33de-b247-6cedec2dcf55","content_url":"http:\/\/www.mcclatchydc.com\/news\/politics-government\/national-politics\/article189918049.html","content_published_at":1513354020,"content_time":1513354020,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-0379b04b-c83f-3f7e-ad39-5115886e66f8_a-87627213-d7d4-371b-91b3-c4b7a838bec7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/muslim-leaders-unite-against-trump-4rittc6","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/muslim-leaders-unite-against-trump-145326247.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7Utcp61Xpoy1SWVltzmAuw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/ed25011a9281d8fd61f6b4233ca4be9a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_yrSEfluGhOmi.rVGWIBXA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/ed25011a9281d8fd61f6b4233ca4be9a","height":1080,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/ed25011a9281d8fd61f6b4233ca4be9a","imgw":1920,"imgh":1080,"title":"Muslim Leaders Unite Against Trump, Say East Jerusalem should be Palestinian capital","summary":"The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) met in Istanbul\u00a0exactly one week after Trump announced that the U.S. officially recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will be relocating its embassy to the city from Tel Aviv.

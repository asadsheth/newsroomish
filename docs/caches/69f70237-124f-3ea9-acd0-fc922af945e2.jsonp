Photos of the chaotic scene show the school bus on its side in the median of Route 80 near Mount Olive Township, which is about 50 miles west of New York City. The students -- fifth-graders at East Brook Middle School in Paramus, New Jersey -- were on the way to a field trip at the time of the collision, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said at a news conference from the middle school.","published_at":1526571903,"content_id":"f57a479a-c414-30ac-919b-4359d4b2e553","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/school-bus-collides-dump-truck-jersey-injuries-reported-150103465--abc-news-topstories.html","content_published_at":1526590863,"content_time":1526590863,"content_relative_time":1,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

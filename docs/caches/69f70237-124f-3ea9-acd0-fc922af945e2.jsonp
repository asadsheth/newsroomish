President Bashar al-Assad is believed to have secretly kept part of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile despite a U.S.-Russian deal under which Damascus was supposed to have handed over all such weapons for destruction in 2014, the officials said. Assad's forces have instead \"evolved\" their chemical weapons and made continued occasional use of them in smaller amounts since a deadly attack last April that drew a U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, the officials told reporters in a briefing.","published_at":1517529571,"content_id":"0d4b5057-514d-35f4-899c-611928625331","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-says-syria-may-developing-types-chemical-weapons-180713339.html","content_published_at":1517529571,"content_time":1517529571,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-6e4d1c5a-09e6-34b2-ab1e-f29eee372713_a-f9931fc2-ef22-3293-bc34-2651779fc255","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/first-cnn-train-crash-investigation-279o3a5","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNN","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/01\/politics\/republican-train-crash-investigation\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_allpolitics+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Politics%29","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IKifCPMj6sEZ1LD2c8GtQw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/35iSX5PhD2bthliC6_Jk7Q--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f9931fc2-ef22-3293-bc34-2651779fc255-1037477646.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bBHn7UETWOWRWszH4QYaqA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MTk7dz0xMTAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/35iSX5PhD2bthliC6_Jk7Q--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f9931fc2-ef22-3293-bc34-2651779fc255-1037477646.jpeg","height":619,"width":1100,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/35iSX5PhD2bthliC6_Jk7Q--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f9931fc2-ef22-3293-bc34-2651779fc255-1037477646.jpeg","imgw":1100,"imgh":619,"title":"First on CNN: Train crash investigation focusing on truck driver's actions","summary":"Eyewitnesses have told National Transportation Safety Board investigators the truck driver -- who is alive but in serious condition, according to authorities -- was seen trying to snake his way through the crossing gates, despite signals that included lights warning of the oncoming train, two sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The Amtrak train, which was chartered by GOP lawmakers to take them from Washington, DC, to West Virginia for their retreat, was traveling at approximately 60 mph at the time of the accident. The tracks where the accident happened are not often active passenger rails and are usually only used for freight trains, which travel much more slowly, usually around 30 mph. This Amtrak train was going roughly twice as fast as trains that usually travel on these tracks, so the truck driver may have miscalculated how much time he had if he mistook the Amtrak for the usual slower freight train.","published_at":1517517437,"content_id":"f9931fc2-ef22-3293-bc34-2651779fc255","content_url":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/01\/politics\/republican-train-crash-investigation\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_allpolitics+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Politics%29","content_published_at":1517509820,"content_time":1517509820,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-2f509b01-6a0a-333b-8956-b1d0799e3854_a-f8194d58-538d-3bfb-b74b-6d93734a5e26","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/canada-police-dig-clues-landscaper-tied-deaths-395xt7b","author":"nanook","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/canada-police-dig-clues-landscaper-tied-deaths-172639630.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jyZcOwEaMyoXXY_uk.iQew--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/37f25ad32a504f8684b5535e80c9f291.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6xjXoY7KSkeaLhE7hwdkqQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/37f25ad32a504f8684b5535e80c9f291.jpg","height":2400,"width":3600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/37f25ad32a504f8684b5535e80c9f291.jpg","imgw":3600,"imgh":2400,"title":"Canada police dig for clues after landscaper tied to deaths","summary":"TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Vian Ewart quickly figured out why police showed up at his elegant town house with a cadaver dog to search the waist-high stone planter at his doorstep.","published_at":1517506083,"content_id":"f8194d58-538d-3bfb-b74b-6d93734a5e26","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/canada-police-dig-clues-landscaper-tied-deaths-172639630.html","content_published_at":1517515033,"content_time":1517515033,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-161ba2c9-8e13-3d0e-b5b5-70d7f9a89df8_a-3f58d236-ac10-34fb-8a5b-2e198af7cc84","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/truck-plows-over-perus-nazca-lines-damaging-unesco-191503752--abc-news-topstories-50js39u","author":"nanook","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/truck-plows-over-perus-nazca-lines-damaging-unesco-191503752--abc-news-topstories.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/S7xsJMLb0yoMtSRaer52jQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/peru-nazca-lines-hummingbird-5-gty-jt-180201_16x9_992.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kNGyDWqincIN2eXUC8vPJg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTg7dz05OTI7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/peru-nazca-lines-hummingbird-5-gty-jt-180201_16x9_992.jpg","height":558,"width":992,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/peru-nazca-lines-hummingbird-5-gty-jt-180201_16x9_992.jpg","imgw":992,"imgh":558,"title":"Truck plows over Peru's Nazca Lines, damaging UNESCO World Heritage Site","summary":"A truck driver plowed over Peru's renowned Nazca Lines, damaging the UNESCO World Heritage Site, officials said.

At least 11 people died and 41 were\u00a0wounded in three blasts\u00a0during Sunday services in Indonesia's second-biggest city Surabaya -\u00a0the deadliest attacks for years in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. The national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said the family who carried out the attacks\u00a0had been in Syria, where the Islamic State group until recently controlled a large swath of territory. The family's father exploded a car bomb, two sons aged 18 and 16 used a motorbike in their attack and the mother was with two children aged 12 and 9. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility.\u00a0\"Three martyrdom attacks killed 11 and wounded at least 41 among church guards and Christians,\" it said via the Telegram messaging app on Sunday afternoon. A damaged motorbike is seen at the scene outside a church following a suicide bomb in Surabaya Credit: BEAWIHARTA\/\u00a0REUTERS Indonesia has been on high alert following attacks by homegrown militants, including some claimed by the Islamic State group, as it grapples with rising intolerance towards religious minorities. East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera confirmed the deaths of 11 people with 41 injured after three churches were hit by apparently coordinated attacks around 7.30 am (12.30am GMT). TV footage appeared to show a person on a motorcycle driving into the grounds of one church before a bomb went off seconds later. Televised eyewitness reports suggested that one suicide bomber was a veiled woman with a couple of children in tow. Other images showed a vehicle engulfed in flames and plumes of thick black smoke as a body lay outside the gate of Santa Maria Catholic church, with motorcycles toppled over amid the debris.

Police experts disarmed two unexploded bombs at the Gereja Pantekosta Pusat Surabaya (Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church), which was also hit by a live blast. Also targeted was the Kristen Indonesia Diponegoro Church. The attacks came just days after five members of Indonesia's elite anti-terrorism squad and a prisoner were killed in clashes that saw Islamist inmates take a guard hostage at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for that incident although police denied its involvement. Police on Sunday said four suspected members of the radical group Jamaah Anshar Daulah had been killed in a shootout during raids linked to the prison riot, but would not comment on whether the group was connected to Sunday's bombings. Terror and tourism in Indonesia Nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 260 million people are Muslim, but there are significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists. Concerns about sectarian intolerance have been on the rise, with churches targeted in the past. Police shot and wounded an IS-inspired radical who attacked a church congregation outside Indonesia's cultural capital Yogyakarta with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. Four people were injured. In 2000 bombs disguised as Christmas gifts delivered to churches and clergymen killed 19 people on Christmas Eve and injured scores more across the country. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people - mostly foreign tourists - in the country's worst-ever terror attack. Sunday's bombings had the highest death toll since nine people were killed in 2009 attacks on two luxury hotels in Jakarta. Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown in recent years that smashed some networks, and most recent attacks have been low-level and targeted domestic security forces. But the coordinated nature of Sunday's bombings suggested a higher level of planning, analysts said. \"Recent (previous) attacks have been far less 'professional',\" Sidney Jones, an expert on Southeast Asian terrorism and director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, told AFP. The emergence of IS has proved a potent new rallying cry for radicals, sparking fears that homegrown extremist outfits could get a new lease of life. A gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta left four attackers and four civilians dead in 2016, and was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia.","published_at":1526198659,"content_id":"bbc1c192-df2b-3458-9c70-ee181be45fb3","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/deadly-bomb-attacks-target-three-030954871.html","content_published_at":1526213292,"content_time":1526213292,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Syrian conflict","vibe_id":"543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e6583357-e169-33ee-b822-115e35a7f631","post_id":"v-543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6_c-ad953dcd-16c7-3727-826d-c987eb1843c4_a-e6583357-e169-33ee-b822-115e35a7f631","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6_c-ad953dcd-16c7-3727-826d-c987eb1843c4_a-e6583357-e169-33ee-b822-115e35a7f631","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/syrian-crisis\/v-543094d4-60a7-11e5-9066-fa163e2c24a6_c-ad953dcd-16c7-3727-826d-c987eb1843c4_a-e6583357-e169-33ee-b822-115e35a7f631","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/islamic-state-group-claims-deadly-indonesia-church-attacks-112641583.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/oyf9KlK1xVic4yHmG9X0Tw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/953bcb0f21b3f5ad5e429b88eb760b0c79d9be62.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V5fHNaAERuQAClQxXY0EFQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/953bcb0f21b3f5ad5e429b88eb760b0c79d9be62.jpg","height":682,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/953bcb0f21b3f5ad5e429b88eb760b0c79d9be62.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":682,"title":"Islamic State group claims deadly Indonesia church attacks","summary":"The Islamic State group was responsible for suicide attacks against three churches in Indonesia that killed at least 11 people on Sunday, it said via its propaganda agency Amaq.

It wasn't always pretty, but they got it. The action got started halfway through the first period, when Nick Foligno took a hooking penalty. The Jackets' PK held strong and had possession as the penalty expired. Matt Calvert carried the puck through the neutral zone, then drop passed to a trailing Foligno, fresh out of the box. Foligno's snipe was good and the Jackets struck first, as they had in the first two games of the trip.

Boston is in the mix for the Presidents' Trophy and could conceivably finish with a better record than Cassidy's 82-game sample. He started his coaching career in the 1996-97 season, with the ECHL'S Jacksonville Lizard Kings. His career has taken him all over pro and junior leagues in North America, but Cassidy hit his stride in Providence.

The officer was patrolling near Teatree Court and Thornton Way, off Moorpark Avenue, when around 6:50 p.m. Monday, he looked up the license plate of a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck in the area, according to San Jose police. That plate search determined that the truck was reported stolen. It appeared that the driver of the truck was aware of the police attention because as it left the area, a white GMC Yukon rammed the officer's vehicle, police said. While the patrol vehicle sustained major front-end damage, the officer escaped injury, police said.","published_at":1519177789,"content_id":"6b6f928d-1a6e-36e2-beb3-23bcb3bd42f1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/02\/20\/san-jose-police-seeking-suspects-who-rammed-patrol-vehicle\/","content_published_at":1519177536,"content_time":1519177536,"content_relative_time":328,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"San Jose","vibe_id":"a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":328,"comment_relative_time":328,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4","post_id":"v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-b679fc50-8149-3004-8a01-4663b1df3fbd_a-b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550_c-b679fc50-8149-3004-8a01-4663b1df3fbd_a-b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/san-jose-calif\/san-jose-google-project-group-2cs5oik","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Saratoga, CA Patch","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/patch.com\/california\/saratoga\/s\/gczv1\/san-jose-google-project-group-calls-for-transparency","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qu.qGHHiqnA_6xIZSq7Akg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rZ6MdHZTjmNiVt5fe4cFAg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4-1526383957.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QG.MLSkmJ05dQrXdkbnYTQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MDA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rZ6MdHZTjmNiVt5fe4cFAg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4-1526383957.jpeg","height":600,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rZ6MdHZTjmNiVt5fe4cFAg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4-1526383957.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":600,"title":"San Jose Google Project: Group Calls For Transparency","summary":"SILICON VALLEY, CA \u2014 Community leaders in San Jose are calling for the public release of non-disclosure agreements signed by city leaders in relation to a Google project that involves the sale of publicly-owned land.On Friday, the organization Silicon Valley Rising released letters that they and fellow community associations sent to Mayor Sam Liccardo and the San Jose City Council demanding transparency in the agreements they signed with Google that prohibit discussion of aspects of negotiations between the agencies. \"The public deserves to know which city agencies and officials may be unable to fully disclose their discussions with the company going forward,\" Silicon Valley Rising campaign director","published_at":1519165213,"content_id":"b9e4507f-b74f-33cb-a5a4-67189e7b85e4","content_url":"https:\/\/patch.com\/california\/saratoga\/s\/gczv1\/san-jose-google-project-group-calls-for-transparency","content_published_at":1519166822,"content_time":1519166822,"content_relative_time":331,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"San Jose","vibe_id":"a4e6cc20-f784-3169-8d99-2e22d369a550","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":331,"comment_relative_time":331,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

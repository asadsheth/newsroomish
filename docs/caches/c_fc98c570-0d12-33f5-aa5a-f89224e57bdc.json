She'd read my comments in The Daily Mail about an abstract from a meeting identifying gene variants associated with transgender identity in a handful of people. But the writer, with whom I hadn't communicated, didn't name the researcher. So people thought it was me. Soon, Google Alerts sent me the full version of the article in The Times, by Oliver Moody, and then I recalled having emailed with him.

Using new theoretical results and experiments on neuronal cultures, a group of scientists, led by Prof. Ido Kanter, of the Department of Physics and the Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar-Ilan University, has demonstrated that the central assumption for nearly 70 years that learning occurs only in the synapses is mistaken. In an article published today in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers go against conventional wisdom to show that learning is actually done by several dendrites, similar to the slow learning mechanism currently attributed to the synapses.","published_at":1521800270,"content_id":"f0cc3b2e-4756-3dae-a8bd-6173f5180de4","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-03-brain-differently-weve-assumed-20th.html","content_published_at":1521799201,"content_time":1521799201,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fecb2af0-c484-3373-bf0b-11bb9d1c49a8","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-922f999f-6bd4-3c3d-808c-942d0287bfdb_a-fecb2af0-c484-3373-bf0b-11bb9d1c49a8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-922f999f-6bd4-3c3d-808c-942d0287bfdb_a-fecb2af0-c484-3373-bf0b-11bb9d1c49a8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-922f999f-6bd4-3c3d-808c-942d0287bfdb_a-fecb2af0-c484-3373-bf0b-11bb9d1c49a8","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Independent","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/mystery-alien-skeleton-found-chilean-170235973.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.Ui0FSqSstufyDtr7yBAng--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_577\/84031ba32efff47911656a24c673da47","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wo5rcqZc2tMf1A7_Y3Yruw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz03Njg7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_577\/84031ba32efff47911656a24c673da47","height":576,"width":768,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_577\/84031ba32efff47911656a24c673da47","imgw":768,"imgh":576,"title":"Mystery of \u2018alien\u2019 skeleton found in Chilean desert finally solved by scientists","summary":"After five years of examination, a research team unravelled the genetic make-up of the bizarre specimen found in the Atacama Desert in 2003, and nicknamed \u201cAta\u201d.

However, in August of last year, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch from California did not make such a pitch over maneuver.

Our Milky Way contains large star-forming regions, mostly along its spiral arms, indicating stellar life. But other, mostly elliptical galaxies, stopped forming stars many billions of years ago. These galaxies are called red-and-dead,\u00a0because they don't have any hot, young, blue stars associated with recent star formation. Since the hottest, bluest stars burn through their fuel the fastest,\u00a0an intrinsic red color is evidence that no new stars have formed for a long time. The leading theory is that galaxies require gas to form new stars. If no stars are forming, the galaxy must be gas-free.

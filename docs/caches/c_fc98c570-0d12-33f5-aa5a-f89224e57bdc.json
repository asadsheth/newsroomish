The study of ancient mound builders who lived in the Mississippi River Delta near present-day New Orleans offers fresh insight into how the settlements emerged and why they were abandoned. Experts studied a site known as Grand Caillou, one of hundreds of ancient mounds in coastal Louisiana that were built near waterways. Radiocarbon dating, carbon-isotope analysis, and sediment analysis were used to date the site, along with ceramics found at Grand Caillou. \"We wanted to understand at a deeper level how Indigenous peoples of the coast were choosing where to build their villages,\" said University of","published_at":1527097863,"content_id":"1ffc43a2-8f8c-3186-b611-a6010ed1e603","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/2018\/05\/23\/ancient-native-american-village-in-louisiana-reveals-its-secrets.html","content_published_at":1527096840,"content_time":1527096840,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e374094f-42c9-3c93-941d-e51d750df350","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-eebe26a9-1483-329b-b777-f261672306c9_a-e374094f-42c9-3c93-941d-e51d750df350","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-eebe26a9-1483-329b-b777-f261672306c9_a-e374094f-42c9-3c93-941d-e51d750df350","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/know-universe-infinite-x68vpyn","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/quora\/2018\/05\/23\/how-do-we-know-the-universe-is-infinite\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7ZDOtxpaXufIUEnYrZiPMQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l2NGRjo3MuskFw12seF0tQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e374094f-42c9-3c93-941d-e51d750df350--1496634843.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4s.tJm6_gwus1HAYon3V6w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l2NGRjo3MuskFw12seF0tQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e374094f-42c9-3c93-941d-e51d750df350--1496634843.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l2NGRjo3MuskFw12seF0tQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e374094f-42c9-3c93-941d-e51d750df350--1496634843.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"How Do We Know The Universe Is Infinite?","summary":"Is the universe infinite or do we say that because we have not traveled to or seen its walls yet? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

The Australopithecus pelvis and leg bones are similar to ours, and A. afarensis likely stood upright, like us. But they were extremely different in a hugely important way: They had relatively tiny brains \u2014 nearly three times smaller than today's Homo sapiens version. This is one of the great questions in human evolution: What happened to make the small, early brains of Lucy and her kind balloon into the smarty-pants, socially adept noggins we have today? Large brains are the defining characteristic of our species.","published_at":1527095321,"content_id":"51eeaf89-86c9-3894-854c-9219e66ed421","content_url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/science-and-health\/2018\/5\/23\/17377200\/human-brain-size-evolution-nature","content_published_at":1527051600,"content_time":1527051600,"content_relative_time":36,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":36,"comment_relative_time":36,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

Unfortunately for those who would use this point to debate in favor of extraterrestrial life, not all worlds are created equal and new research suggests that one of the elements crucial to life as we know it might be incredibly rare.

And new research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis suggests that aging immune cells increase the risk for age-related macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness in the United States. Studying mice and cells from patients, the researchers found that as immune cells called macrophages age, they are more likely to contribute to the inflammation and abnormal blood vessel growth that damage vision in macular degeneration. Their findings are published April 5 in the journal JCI Insight. \"Drug treatments for macular degeneration aren't effective for some patients, who either have a minimal response or not response at all, and","published_at":1522941090,"content_id":"96dbb08b-37d2-3c20-aa9f-a4fa81b2c267","content_url":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-04-macular-degeneration-linked-aging-immune.html","content_published_at":1522933203,"content_time":1522933203,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-597ab4a7-be64-3ab6-b2dd-8c3cf9a3fb5b_a-36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-597ab4a7-be64-3ab6-b2dd-8c3cf9a3fb5b_a-36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-597ab4a7-be64-3ab6-b2dd-8c3cf9a3fb5b_a-36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"medicalxpress.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2018-04-relevance-gaba-diabetes-highlighted.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b1BO5MycB3okHwTLGRpxpA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z.VWOO1r5c2MaREnQQbAjA--\/dz0zMDg7aD0zMDg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab-386879296.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RpGOu8hBwWEcL_HL1XwazQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDg7dz0zMDg7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z.VWOO1r5c2MaREnQQbAjA--\/dz0zMDg7aD0zMDg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab-386879296.jpeg","height":308,"width":308,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z.VWOO1r5c2MaREnQQbAjA--\/dz0zMDg7aD0zMDg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_36607cbc-ab6b-3f22-90f7-4b28adb0e0ab-386879296.jpeg","imgw":308,"imgh":308,"title":"The relevance of GABA for diabetes highlighted in two new studies","summary":"Dynamic interactions between the nervous system, hormones and the immune system are normally ongoing, but in diabetes the balance is disturbed.

GABA is synthesized by an enzyme called GAD from the amino acid glutamate in nerve cells but also in the insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic islets. GAD has two forms, GAD65 and GAD67.

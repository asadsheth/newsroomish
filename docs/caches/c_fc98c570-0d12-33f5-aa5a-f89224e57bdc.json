Anglerfish are some of the most elusive creatures in the deep sea. The couple was filmed by German researchers Kirsten and Joachim Jakobsen while aboard LULA1000, the manned submersible operated by the Rebikoff-Niggeler Foundation. For nearly a half-hour, scientists filmed the female anglerfish as she tumbled gently along with the ocean current at a depth 2,600 feet. The footage features her parasitic mate, a male one-tenth her size, clutched to her belly. The video is available to stream on Vimeo.

Using new theoretical results and experiments on neuronal cultures, a group of scientists, led by Prof. Ido Kanter, of the Department of Physics and the Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar-Ilan University, has demonstrated that the central assumption for nearly 70 years that learning occurs only in the synapses is mistaken.

These galaxies are called red-and-dead,\u00a0because they don't have any hot, young, blue stars associated with recent star formation. Since the hottest, bluest stars burn through their fuel the fastest,\u00a0an intrinsic red color is evidence that no new stars have formed for a long time.

Working at Heriot-Watt University, they've created a system that uses sunlight to create hydrogen more cheaply and efficiently than before. Hydrogen is the lightest element in the Universe. A gas at room temperature, it burns with oxygen to give off heat and water vapour. (In air there are also small amounts of nitrogen oxide.) Unlike carbon-based fossil fuels, there is no carbon dioxide (CO2) to add to the planet's climate concerns. It is that feature which has made it a prime candidate to be a major part of our future energy supplies.

If the continent is to feed its growing population, farmers must find ways to control them. Pests account for high losses in other developing regions too. For smallholder farmers in particular, pest management needs to be affordable, safe and sustainable. It should avoid the drawbacks of synthetic pesticides as far as possible. Research is now showing that integrated approaches can achieve these goals.

As it turns out, getting off the planet is a great way to understand what's really going on with it.","published_at":1521994734,"content_id":"10677cc3-5988-3443-bc73-1b86cfac2499","content_url":"https:\/\/www.pastemagazine.com\/articles\/2018\/03\/national-geographic-one-strange-rock-will-change-t.html","content_published_at":1521993600,"content_time":1521993600,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f29c574f-0717-3bdd-bc81-49f264c55fb6","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-3f1d89f1-30d0-3758-ad85-eed09d1f8c29_a-f29c574f-0717-3bdd-bc81-49f264c55fb6","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-3f1d89f1-30d0-3758-ad85-eed09d1f8c29_a-f29c574f-0717-3bdd-bc81-49f264c55fb6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/darren-aronofsky-apos-tv-series-dqhr2iy","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/darren-aronofsky-apos-tv-series-120102086.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XgeSLVua0bRRULYWCCEHiA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/f42b89ba2f69a63c456f0e50b812901c","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Pd6YgB6UeDvmutyJhQtRiw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04NDE7dz0xNTAwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/f42b89ba2f69a63c456f0e50b812901c","height":841,"width":1500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/f42b89ba2f69a63c456f0e50b812901c","imgw":1500,"imgh":841,"title":"Darren Aronofsky's New TV Series Breaks With The Hollywood Playbook On Climate Change","summary":"The Hollywood approach to climate change is hardly subtle.","published_at":1521979410,"content_id":"f29c574f-0717-3bdd-bc81-49f264c55fb6","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/darren-aronofsky-apos-tv-series-120102086.html","content_published_at":1521979262,"content_time":1521979262,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":29,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-ad2e26b7-e0c5-3b19-a08f-d3e25d67b31a_a-66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-ad2e26b7-e0c5-3b19-a08f-d3e25d67b31a_a-66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/kenyan-fossil-reveals-lions-tall-w8xuccd","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"thetimes.co.uk","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/kenyan-fossil-reveals-lions-as-tall-as-humans-jgvdl6m6d","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j7k3NxBbjWNogYovj0syKA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2SAt9GxpY1xgqUpHv.xwdA--\/dz0yNjY3O2g9MTUwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c-1532736364.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bTiR5NSj8wvlBG7H69ZZ9g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNTAwO3c9MjY2Nzs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2SAt9GxpY1xgqUpHv.xwdA--\/dz0yNjY3O2g9MTUwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c-1532736364.jpeg","height":1500,"width":2667,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2SAt9GxpY1xgqUpHv.xwdA--\/dz0yNjY3O2g9MTUwMDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_66cb8602-f920-32ab-ad09-7205d527b82c-1532736364.jpeg","imgw":2667,"imgh":1500,"title":"Kenyan fossil reveals lions as tall as humans","summary":"Fossil hunters have found the remains of a gigantic lion \u2014 far larger than those in Africa today \u2014 which stood close to human height.

Researchers at an unnamed laboratory bred nearly 180,000 more mice for use in experiments than their license permitted, and carried out unauthorised experiments on them,\u00a0yet received only a letter of reprimand. The mistake is the most alarming of dozens of non-compliance cases by labs across Britain, which are highlighted in an official government report into animal testing. Describing the breach, the report said that a licence had been granted to monitor 127,600 mice over the course of one project, but \u2018this number was significantly exceeded by 179,546\u2019. Scientists working on the project claimed error happened after numbers of mice were recorded on different databases. The report also showed that a primate was left overnight in a recovery incubator after surgery without food or water, while other rodents died when they were not fed properly, or suffocated when their cages were not fixed to air vents. And due to a \u2018miscommuncation\u2019 74 chicks died after being left for 65 hours without adequate humidity. Mice account for 60 per cent\u00a0of the two\u00a0million animals used in scientific testing every year Jan Creamer, President of the National Anti-Vivisection Society said: \u201cThe failure to provide basic care for animals in research is disturbing and raises further questions about compliance and suffering during the procedures themselves. \u201cUsing advanced non-animal methods avoids such doubts and provides better results, for animals and people.\u201d Latest figures show that mice account for 60 per cent\u00a0of the two\u00a0million animals used in scientific testing every year in Britain. Mice are used in research projects to tackle health issues such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Rodents are used for animal research because they are small and adapt well to new environments. They also breed exceptionally quickly, with mothers giving birth to up to 40 mice per year. PETA, the animal rights charity, has previously called for governments and researchers to \u2018stop funding cruel and abusive experiments\u2019 on rats and mice. Writing in the most recent report, Baroness William of Trafford, Minister of State for the Home Office, said: \u201cThe properly regulated use of animals in science has a key role in supporting the development of scientific knowledge. In so doing we must continue to maintain all the controls on only using animals where necessary and using non-animal alternatives where practicable. \u201cWhen animals have to be used we must continue to fully apply the principles of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) and ensure that appropriate welfare standards are met. \u201cI am committed to maintaining our rigorous and robust regulation of the use of animals in science. \u201cThe 3Rs must remain at the heart of the UK regulatory system, which provides assurance to the public, whilst supporting the delivery of world class science in the UK.\u201d","published_at":1521936310,"content_id":"ec2ff256-ba6a-3783-8c7e-b2610cdb388c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/lab-accidentally-created-apos-city-000100574.html","content_published_at":1521936060,"content_time":1521936060,"content_relative_time":41,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":41,"comment_relative_time":41,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"77a0b6c4-6c93-3813-83c3-9d1f47bf7480","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f3196fd2-314e-34c3-bf28-60cfae396a0f_a-77a0b6c4-6c93-3813-83c3-9d1f47bf7480","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f3196fd2-314e-34c3-bf28-60cfae396a0f_a-77a0b6c4-6c93-3813-83c3-9d1f47bf7480","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/treasure-finds-add-picture-palace-1c7odiy","author":"third_watch","provider":"BBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-suffolk-43516695","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iVJhUWvPdXBSOlFXxJx8nA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IYVA1x3vBeuymA3GqVlm9g--\/dz0zMjA7aD0xODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_77a0b6c4-6c93-3813-83c3-9d1f47bf7480-351965256.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BAgi18sXTfQPDUrf0D4kfg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xODA7dz0zMjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IYVA1x3vBeuymA3GqVlm9g--\/dz0zMjA7aD0xODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_77a0b6c4-6c93-3813-83c3-9d1f47bf7480-351965256.jpeg","height":180,"width":320,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IYVA1x3vBeuymA3GqVlm9g--\/dz0zMjA7aD0xODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_77a0b6c4-6c93-3813-83c3-9d1f47bf7480-351965256.jpeg","imgw":320,"imgh":180,"title":"Treasure finds add to 'picture of palace'","summary":"Finds declared as treasure reveal more about what is believed to be a lost Anglo-Saxon royal palace, an archaeologist said.

Image: NASA\/jpl-caltechThat said, this ambiguity could change sometime in the near future.\u00a0 NASA's James Webb Space Telescope \u2014 expected to launch in 2020 \u2014 could help scientists peer into the atmospheres of alien worlds to figure out if they could support life. In total, scientists know of more than 3,700 confirmed exoplanets out there in the universe. TESS, short for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, will also help scientists find more exoplanets circling some of the nearest stars to Earth in the not-too-distant future.

Many Exoplanets Might Have Life? The Number Is. . .","summary":"53. For the moment. But with a caveat. Perhaps nothing is alive on any of these worlds, not even an alien microbe. \u201cPotentially habitable, that's the correct phrasing,\u201d says Abel Mendez, the planetary astrobiologist and professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Mendez is the chief curator of the school's Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, the online database perused by space scientists worldwide. Additions to the catalog are accumulating swiftly, he says. Newest to the list: Ross-128b, discovered last November, a rocky world eleven light years from Earth, in the constellation Virgo. Nearly on the list: Kepler-1652b, likely rocky, more than 800 light years away, in the constellation Cygnus.","published_at":1527571547,"content_id":"ffa3c353-ed0b-3d7c-835a-c7d9ea30ef15","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/billretherford\/2018\/05\/28\/how-many-exoplanets-might-have-life-the-number-is\/","content_published_at":1527570000,"content_time":1527570000,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f41e9c8f-c040-38b5-8b3f-3d97361d4e1e_a-a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f41e9c8f-c040-38b5-8b3f-3d97361d4e1e_a-a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-f41e9c8f-c040-38b5-8b3f-3d97361d4e1e_a-a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"NBC News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/mach\/science\/could-alien-life-exist-parallel-universes-ncna876896?cid=public-rss_20180529","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kUzuXwkjtHBmOJeAoh3Vuw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ewT76tcvZ5nIqrnrEQXdFw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11--1294246918.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8M1hoYDIkPV5RFaFCXax2Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ewT76tcvZ5nIqrnrEQXdFw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11--1294246918.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ewT76tcvZ5nIqrnrEQXdFw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a6597491-d253-35b3-85c7-dff9c4536c11--1294246918.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Could alien life exist in parallel universes?","summary":"It's one thing to look for life elsewhere in the universe.

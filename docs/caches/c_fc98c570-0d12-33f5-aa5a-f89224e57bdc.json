He is working with entertainment company Base Hologram to create an exhibit that will let people feel as though they're on an archaeological dig, inside a laboratory and surrounded by dinosaurs in the wild. \"I'm","published_at":1526832385,"content_id":"e9a83240-c54f-3190-8d5f-8e27a85a2c08","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/05\/20\/the-associated-press-jurassic-park-dinosaur-experts-next-big-thing-holograms.html","content_published_at":1526836995,"content_time":1526836995,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6dbad5f3-5f8b-3aa4-90bb-fc261cf24e3a","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-df073a98-d4b1-36d9-96a4-286e40dd607e_a-6dbad5f3-5f8b-3aa4-90bb-fc261cf24e3a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-df073a98-d4b1-36d9-96a4-286e40dd607e_a-6dbad5f3-5f8b-3aa4-90bb-fc261cf24e3a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/researchers-deep-diving-seals-track-1sck4bi","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Mashable","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/05\/20\/seals-monitor-melting-west-antarctica-ice\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Researchers use deep-diving seals to track melting ice sheets in Antarctica","summary":"Hefty elephant seals regularly dive more than 2,500 feet underwater, holding their breath for 30 minutes while swimming in the dark, frigid ocean depths.

This assessment was based on data gathered from smaller earthquakes that followed North Korea's biggest nuclear test in 2017. A new study published in Science has now confirmed the collapse using satellite radar imaging. The collapse may have played a role in North Korea's change in policy. If correct, and with the hindsight of this research, we might have speculated that the North Koreans would want to make such an offer of peace.

A child with a beloved pet bunny, for example, or an adult looking forward to Easter would naturally see the rabbit, while the thoughts of a field sports enthusiast should spontaneously turn towards the duck. But now chefs believe the same mind games could alter the taste of food and even persuade diners to choose more sustainable meats. Jastrow's rabbit\/duck illusion\u00a0 Oxford Universityand multisensory dining experts Kitchen Theory are currently midway through an experiment based on Jastrow\u2019s rabbit illusion, attempting to see if they can alter the taste of food simply by encouraging the brain to switch between two states while eating. The rabbit\/duck illusion is known in scientific terms as a \u2018bistable precept\u2019 or an image made up of two realities, which forces the brain to choose just one picture at a time or switch between the two. To test if such brain switching could also change the taste of food, Kitchen Theory\u2019s chef Jozef Youssef, has created a dish called the \u2018Jastrow Bistable Bite\u2019 which is a mixture of rabbit and duck. Jastrow's Bistable Bite with the rabbit\/duck illusion painted in orange sauce\u00a0 Credit: Prof Charles Spence\/Kitchen Theory A simplified version of Jastrow\u2019s illusion is then piped onto the plate in blood orange sauce in the hope that the switch between the two will fundamentally alter the flavour. If it works, it will be the first time that anyone has proven that taste can be altered simply by looking at an image. Charles Spence, professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University who has helped Heston Blumethal create his culinary masterpieces, said: \u201cIt may take two to three seconds but we think people might start to notice a different taste in their mouth, based on the image they are looking at. \u201cWe found that people tend to see one of the images more dominantly to begin with, but then there is the \u2018aha\u2019 moment where they suddenly see the other, and the brain starts to flip back and forth between the two, and it is that we are interested in. \u201cRabbit is also something we should be eating more of, so if we can convince people to have a conversation about the taste, and give it a try to see if they like it, then it might alter their idea of it being an acceptable meat. \u201cCurrently in Britain rabbits are viewed as pets whereas in Spain they are seen as everyday ingredients, so maybe we could change the perception in the UK because rabbit is a readily available source of protein which we should be using more.\u201d Professor Charles Spence Credit: Jeff Gilbert\u00a0 The team is also hopeful that the \u2018aha\u2019 moment of understanding the illusion will also stimulate the reward centre of the brain, flooding the body with happy hormones which, in turn, improves the taste. Recently they created an ingenious dish in which the diner opposite could pick out the face of Picasso, again creating the \u2018Eureka\u2019 moment of discovery which boosts flavour and enjoyment. Prof Spence added: \u201cWe know that illusions like this create a surge of happiness and pride when people finally see them, which triggers the brain\u2019s reward mechanism and creates a more positive experience. \u201cIt also stimulates laughter and conversation, and that kind of sociability at the table has been shown to improve taste perception.\u201d Can \u00a0you spot the face? The Picasso dish as it would appear to a dining partner\u00a0 Credit: Kitchen Theory In the first part of the experiment, which was published in the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science, the researchers asked nearly 1,000 people online to pick whether they thought the piped sauce in the \u2018Jastrow Bistable Bite\u2019 dish was a duck or a rabbit. The aim was to select the most ambiguous positioning of the illusion for future taste tests. In coming weeks they intend to serve up the dish to diners to see if it really will alter flavour. Previously Prof Spence has shown that flavour can change based on sounds, an effect known as \u2018sonic seasoning.\u2019 The team is also experimenting with playing the sound of duck shoots and the slaughter of animals while diners are eating to encourage people to take greater responsibility for where their food comes from.","published_at":1526796524,"content_id":"929664dc-b667-398e-af25-a258ffcb7a3c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gastro-trickery-optical-illusions-could-060000276.html","content_published_at":1526796000,"content_time":1526796000,"content_relative_time":36,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":36,"comment_relative_time":36,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0e315196-dc5c-3007-b32a-a25eeee6ff6a","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b588f7ec-7e00-3fd6-86bf-6a891daee5cc_a-0e315196-dc5c-3007-b32a-a25eeee6ff6a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b588f7ec-7e00-3fd6-86bf-6a891daee5cc_a-0e315196-dc5c-3007-b32a-a25eeee6ff6a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/goes-west-top-game-c9khusw","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Hanford Sentinel","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/hanfordsentinel.com\/news\/local\/goes-west-at-the-top-of-its-game\/article_b8cd3942-67f9-5d82-aaa8-a2550c2a7e41.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gyE2Iav56h34j7FWUI6SEw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_8si_XOWvectUqIRSnDjSQ--\/dz0zNTg7aD0yMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0e315196-dc5c-3007-b32a-a25eeee6ff6a-1417520924.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YKDiMuwVU6coR_s9w3exCg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMDA7dz0zNTg7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_8si_XOWvectUqIRSnDjSQ--\/dz0zNTg7aD0yMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0e315196-dc5c-3007-b32a-a25eeee6ff6a-1417520924.jpeg","height":200,"width":358,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_8si_XOWvectUqIRSnDjSQ--\/dz0zNTg7aD0yMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0e315196-dc5c-3007-b32a-a25eeee6ff6a-1417520924.jpeg","imgw":358,"imgh":200,"title":"GOES-West at the top of its game","summary":"\u201cOver the next four months it will move to 137W longitude, which will give us a much better view of California compared to GOES-16 launched back in November 2016.

dodges prison for being passed out on drugs as son froze to death","summary":"A North Carolina woman will not serve prison time after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of her 3-year-old son, who froze to death on the front porch of their home after she \u201cpassed out\u201d on drugs. Jamie Lyn Basinger, 24, of Morganton, received a suspended sentence of 19 to 32 months with 3 years of supervised probation after pleading guilty in connection to the death of Landyn Melton in March, the Charlotte Observer reports. A judge on Monday also ordered Basinger, who spent eight months in jail after being charged in April, to comply with all conditions of a substance abuse assessment, perform 72 hours of community service and adhere to all orders from the Department of Social Services regarding her other child, according to the newspaper. Prosecutors said Basinger's usage of methamphetamine two days before the child's death, as well as smoking marijuana the night before, led to the boy's death.","published_at":1513180722,"content_id":"8e352908-2f1e-39ac-9347-04e26316dc3b","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/12\/12\/mom-dodges-prison-for-being-passed-out-on-drugs-as-son-froze-to-death\/","content_published_at":1513101833,"content_time":1513101833,"content_relative_time":64,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":64,"comment_relative_time":64,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

Residents of Democratic-leaning Deerfield, Illinois have until June 13 to remove any firearms and magazines that fall outside the new restrictions or face a fine of between $250 and $1,000 per day, according to an ordinance passed by the town board on Monday night. The ban was a direct response to the Feb. 14 killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and the student-led campaign for tighter restrictions on guns inspired by the mass shooting, the ordinance said.","published_at":1522879321,"content_id":"50edd748-0b40-37f8-ac80-1b1958bfc103","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/chicago-suburb-bans-assault-weapons-florida-massacre-183333351.html","content_published_at":1522866813,"content_time":1522866813,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society

found hanged at a mansion outside San Diego in 2011, determining that the brother of the woman's boyfriend was liable for her death. Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found dead on July 13, 2011 at the house in Coronado, Calif. Authorities ruled her death a suicide, but Zahau's mother and older sister disagreed, claiming that Adam Shacknai \u2014\u00a0who called police to report that he had found Zahau's body \u2014 struck her on the head, sexually assaulted and strangled her, and then staged the hanging. \"Why did Adam Shacknai brutally murder Rebecca Zahau?\" C.

Chief Ed Barberini of San Bruno police said that the three\u00a0victims suffered from \"treatable injuries\". Two were shot \"at an adjacent business\". A 32-year-old female was described as being in a serious condition; a\u00a027-year-old female was in a fair condition, and a\u00a036-year-old male was described as being in a critical condition by CNN. He said that the first 911 calls came at 12:46pm, and his officers were on the scene two minutes later. \u201cUpon arriving, officers found a chaotic situation with employees streaming out of the building,\u201d he said. The scenes following the shooting at the headquarters of YouTube in San Bruno, California Credit: Reuters \u201cWe did encounter one victim with apparent gunshot wound towards the front of the building as we arrived. \u201cSeveral minutes later, while conducting a search of the premises, officers located a second individual with a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted. \u201cThere were two more at an adjacent business.\u201d An employee at a nearby Carl's Jr. fast food restaurant said one of the victims came in after being shot. The employee told KTVU the female victim had a gunshot wound to her calf and he tied a makeshift tourniquet around it. None of the victims were named last night, but Fox News reported that one of the victims was the shooter's boyfriend, and police were not treating the incident as terrorism. YouTube shooting - San Francisco Mass shootings by women are exceptionally rare. A FBI study of shootings from 2000 to 2013 found that, of 160 incidents, only six were carried out by a female attacker. President Donald Trump said that he was monitoring events, and wrote on Twitter: \"Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\u2019s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.\" Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube\u2019s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018 Shaken YouTube employees were left reeling from the incident, which was over in less than an hour. Todd Sherman, a product manager in the building, wrote on Twitter:\u00a0 \"We were sitting in a meeting and then we heard people running because it was rumbling the floor. First thought was earthquake.\" Emergency services are on the scene at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California On the way out of the building he \"looked down and saw blood drips on the floor and stairs\". He added: \"Police cruisers pulled up, hopped out with rifles ready and I told them where the situation was.\" Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee, tweeted that he and his colleagues were inside the offices and saw people running and barricaded themselves inside the offices. After around 20 minutes he tweeted again to say that he had been evacuated, and footage from helicopters showed hundreds of employees leaving the sprawling campus, being checked for weapons as they went. Active shooter at YouTube HQ. Heard shots and saw people running while at my desk. Now barricaded inside a room with coworkers.\u2014 Vadim Lavrusik (@Lavrusik) April 3, 2018 Safe. Got evacuated it. Outside now.\u2014 Vadim Lavrusik (@Lavrusik) April 3, 2018 \u201cI was on a video conference with someone in the building when it happened,\u201d one woman, who did not want to be identified, told CNN. \u201cWe were suddenly aware of people running and screaming. The people on the video conference became scared and said: \u2018I have to get out of here.\u2019 \u201cWe called security, who had already been made aware of the incident. We heard on the video conference sounds of people running and screaming, but it was hard to hear anything else at that time.\u201d The woman said her colleague later told her that she did not hear any shots. A female bystander told KTVU television: \"I heard boom, boom, boom. Then I heard it again. It was loud and then like it was going away.\" Local television images show employees being evacuated from the California Youtube campus Credit: Universal News\u00a0 Breaking down, she added: \"I'm having a hard time. Don't get me started on guns.\" In a statement Google, which owns YouTube, said: \"Regarding the YouTube situation, we are coordinating with authorities and will provide official information here from Google and YouTube as it becomes available.\" The San Bruno offices house 1,700 employees in a largely open-plan environment, in four different buildings. YouTube employees can work from treadmill desks, travel around the campus by scooter and bring their dogs to work. The campus also has a lap pool and a putting green for employees to use. There is security at all the buildings, the employee told CNN. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Donald Trump had been briefed and the administration was monitoring the situation. YouTube announced last month that it would ban content promoting the sale of guns and gun accessories as well as videos that teach how to make guns.\u00a0","published_at":1522807244,"content_id":"af3ab86f-9b5f-3785-9bfa-cce9d05869da","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gunshots-heard-outside-youtube-office-201551179.html","content_published_at":1522798505,"content_time":1522798505,"content_relative_time":40,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society

They are proof that you have the power to change your financial circumstances and that you don't have to wait for a miracle to achieve financial freedom. In this final edition of the Money Makeover, we recap their journeys and hope they will inspire you to create your own financial freedom.","published_at":1522016971,"content_id":"4ce5c3a2-81b9-3f21-b2dc-3e8be19e49be","content_url":"https:\/\/city-press.news24.com\/Special-Report\/MoneyMakeover\/money-makeover-the-faces-of-financial-freedom-20180325","content_published_at":1521995136,"content_time":1521995136,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549","post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-c8ffa2e7-2e85-37cc-9857-76a3888a1e3b_a-dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-c8ffa2e7-2e85-37cc-9857-76a3888a1e3b_a-dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/protect-assets-against-stock-market-35oa1li","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Motley Fool","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/retirement\/2018\/03\/25\/how-to-protect-your-assets-against-a-stock-market.aspx","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Qsr8v9PB9hUVERK0VmHM9g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/72WohJ4dveoGyvqv.UlD1A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549--1070191743.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KhGEIK73MGqbaoJNjcp13Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/72WohJ4dveoGyvqv.UlD1A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549--1070191743.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/72WohJ4dveoGyvqv.UlD1A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549--1070191743.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"How to Protect Your Assets Against a Stock Market Crash","summary":"Fears of a stock market crash have risen dramatically so far this year, as many believe that the nine-year bull run for stocks could be giving way to the next bear market. In particular, using asset allocation strategies to diversify your portfolio and ensuring that you've rebalanced to adjust to changing market conditions can go a long way toward protecting your assets from a stock market crash. Various types of investments react differently to stock market crashes, and having a mix of different asset classes can help reduce the impact of a crash. By choosing assets that won't go down as much as stocks in a crash, your overall losses will be less than they would've been if you'd had 100% of your investments in the stock market.","published_at":1521990230,"content_id":"dcb3ddc2-bbdf-3722-bf56-1451f3a26549","content_url":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/retirement\/2018\/03\/25\/how-to-protect-your-assets-against-a-stock-market.aspx","content_published_at":1521987480,"content_time":1521987480,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"57894f85-8e00-3020-bdac-305c18adad71","post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-e78493a7-25a5-30f8-8ad1-0f5ff3f7fbba_a-57894f85-8e00-3020-bdac-305c18adad71","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-e78493a7-25a5-30f8-8ad1-0f5ff3f7fbba_a-57894f85-8e00-3020-bdac-305c18adad71","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/money-troubles-worry-seniors-more-5sq9dq0","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Motley Fool","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/retirement\/2018\/03\/25\/money-troubles-worry-seniors-more-than-death.aspx","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zJCgVvUV0oWp2GptT_GJyQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_wMgbn_A.SyS3ygCAOUCXg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_57894f85-8e00-3020-bdac-305c18adad71-928440321.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/czRI5IeYzzM8X8VCou4nqA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_wMgbn_A.SyS3ygCAOUCXg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_57894f85-8e00-3020-bdac-305c18adad71-928440321.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_wMgbn_A.SyS3ygCAOUCXg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_57894f85-8e00-3020-bdac-305c18adad71-928440321.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Money Troubles Worry Seniors More Than Death","summary":"In a recent study conducted by Bay Alarm Medical, more than 1,000 people were asked to name their biggest fears associated with getting older.

A statement warned reporters to \"be very cautious\" about claims made of the internal workings on Mueller's probe, which have resulted in \"many\" claims which don't stack up. Outlets, including Business Insider, routinely report on the progress of the probe, often citing anonymous sources whose knowledge of the investigation itself is unclear. The practice is a long-standing journalistic convention which protects sources from reprisal for speaking out of turn. Mueller's office does not typically give much on-the-record commentary","published_at":1523972772,"content_id":"9995ccbc-5327-37f8-8117-3578e1619e25","content_url":"http:\/\/businessinsider.com\/robert-mueller-warns-many-stories-on-trump-investigation-not-true-2018-4?IR=T","content_published_at":1523941200,"content_time":1523941200,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Russia investigation","vibe_id":"2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":16,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4","post_id":"v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-304f22f5-2c05-37f7-b8c7-bbb07bc4b69b_a-fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-304f22f5-2c05-37f7-b8c7-bbb07bc4b69b_a-fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/russia-investigation\/v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-304f22f5-2c05-37f7-b8c7-bbb07bc4b69b_a-fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"miamiherald","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/business\/article209088144.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Afn7zyAdfyzY7z.iQS113Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/S7JPLEOftzZ5IhtK7xUgQA--\/dz0xMTQwO2g9NjQxO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4--301528349.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FnS7JOTXc2Us3uPVVUyHyA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NDE7dz0xMTQwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/S7JPLEOftzZ5IhtK7xUgQA--\/dz0xMTQwO2g9NjQxO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4--301528349.jpeg","height":641,"width":1140,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/S7JPLEOftzZ5IhtK7xUgQA--\/dz0xMTQwO2g9NjQxO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4--301528349.jpeg","imgw":1140,"imgh":641,"title":"Defending Trump in Russia probe? It's hardly a dream job","summary":"Several prominent lawyers asked to help represent President Donald Trump in the last year have spurned the assignment at least partly out of concerns he wouldn't pay his bills and doesn't listen to legal advice, according to people familiar with the conversations. The result is that as investigators intensify their focus on the president's inner circle, including his personal lawyer, Trump has been left with a lean legal team that has struggled to add criminal defense firepower. The extra help may be especially needed in the critical months ahead, as special counsel Robert Mueller seeks an interview with Trump and reaches conclusions on whether the president engaged in obstruction of justice.","published_at":1523943134,"content_id":"fb16bf62-5a0d-3d4a-b80e-5d395b3163a4","content_url":"http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/business\/article209088144.html","content_published_at":1523941200,"content_time":1523941200,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Russia investigation","vibe_id":"2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":16,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d14b4e69-2435-304e-90d1-5c077731bf05","post_id":"v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-54098837-20ac-3e8c-b685-f2335f53bf1b_a-d14b4e69-2435-304e-90d1-5c077731bf05","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-54098837-20ac-3e8c-b685-f2335f53bf1b_a-d14b4e69-2435-304e-90d1-5c077731bf05","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/russia-investigation\/v-2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799_c-54098837-20ac-3e8c-b685-f2335f53bf1b_a-d14b4e69-2435-304e-90d1-5c077731bf05","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Associated Press","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.ap.org\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/04\/21\/image001-png_162613.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/comey-says-possible-russians-leverage-over-trump-055012916--politics.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NHVo9OPbUbJQ5oaCpbo0Jg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/831a1c10d07a45389316719edfacdc49_original.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Y5BlLzfl8ZyN2AinqK8jfw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xOTk3O3c9MzAwMDs-\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/831a1c10d07a45389316719edfacdc49_original.jpg","height":1997,"width":3000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/831a1c10d07a45389316719edfacdc49_original.jpg","imgw":3000,"imgh":1997,"title":"Comey speculates Russians may have damaging info on Trump","summary":"In his scathing appraisal of the man who fired him as FBI chief, James Comey cited \"some evidence of obstruction of justice\" in President Donald Trump's actions and speculated that Russians might ...","published_at":1523927555,"content_id":"d14b4e69-2435-304e-90d1-5c077731bf05","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/comey-says-possible-russians-leverage-over-trump-055012916--politics.html","content_published_at":1523889184,"content_time":1523889184,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":3,"vibe_name":"Russia investigation","vibe_id":"2d64fd91-5e6d-33de-8103-abddb6e1a799","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

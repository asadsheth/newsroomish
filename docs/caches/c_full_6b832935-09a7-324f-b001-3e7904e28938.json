Harry and Meghan Markle pictured arriving in Windsor for royal wedding rehearsal","summary":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have arrived at Windsor Castle to rehearse for their wedding, still smiling after a difficult week. Ms Markle appeared in good spirits in the car, as she and the Prince were driven down the Long Walk in Windsor. Fiddling with her engagement ring, she wore a simple white shirt with her hair half up and half\u00a0down for a day of final wedding preparations. Prince Harry, who appeared more solemn, was also dressed down, with a grey jumper and white shirt, still sporting a beard. Hours earlier, Ms Markle had confirmed that her father will not be walking her down the aisle at St George's Chapel, in a statement released through Kensington Palace. In a\u00a0personal statement, Meghan Markle said: 'I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health' Credit: Enterprise News and Pictures \"Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,\" she said. \"I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. \"I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday. \" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive in Windsor by car Credit: Karwai Tang As the bride and groom practised their lines behind closed doors, the military were rehearsing their part in the day through the town. Thousands of people turned out to get a flavour of how Saturday will unfold, when the newlyweds head on a 25-minute carriage ride through the town. Video: Military rehearse for wedding day in Windsor Some 250 members of the armed forces are expected to take part in Saturday's festivities, and Thursday's dry run gave organisers a chance to put some finishing touches to the event. Roads around Windsor were closed as wellwishers basked beneath blue skies and beaming sunshine - weather that is expected to stay around for the weekend. Royal wedding countdown in pictures as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's preparations begin Press from around the world, tourists, locals and royal superfans watched from behind barriers as members of the\u00a0military\u00a0paraded around Windsor and up The Long Walk. There was a heavy police presence with armed officers stationed around town and other officers on top of buildings looking over the crowds. The procession included a horsedrawn carriage, setting the scene for what the world will see on Saturday when the newly married Harry and Ms Markle will be seen by the public after the ceremony. After The Wedding Route Mr Markle is still in Mexico where he is recovering after undergoing heart surgery on Wednesday to implant three stents. The reclusive former TV lighting director, who had been due to walk his daughter down the aisle, was caught up in controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi. He reportedly pulled out of attending the ceremony in St George's Chapel on May 19 to avoid embarrassing his daughter, but then later said before his surgery that he wanted to be part of history and hoped to be there, celebrity gossip website TMZ reported.

In an interview with an Australian radio show, the comedian claimed Ms Markle, who is due to marry Prince Harry on Saturday, will be under \"so much pressure\". Speaking on Nova 969's Fitzy and Wippa radio show, she said: \"This poor girl. Your wedding, everyone says it's your day. It's your day. She's like, no it's not. She has to meet all these foreign dignitaries she's never met before, there's so much pressure. Can you imagine having a worse wedding?\" She added: \"That would suck. Her girls from high school aren't going to be there. It's like a parade, it's like Westminster Dog Show.\" The build-up to the royal wedding has been marred with speculation over whether the bride-to-be's father, Thomas Markle, will attend. Amy Schumer onstage in New York, 2015 Credit: Getty He will be \"heartbroken\" to miss his daughter's wedding, it has been reported. Thomas Markle Jr, the brother of Ms Markle, visited Windsor Castle to see where his sibling will marry Prince Harry. Mr Markle Jr's claims came on the day his father was due to undergo heart surgery, and an entertainment website reported he had successfully had three stents fitted. He told the Mirror: \"My dad will be heartbroken that he cannot be with Meg in Windsor to walk her down the aisle.\" Prince Harry, 33, and Ms Markle, 36, will tie the knot at Windsor Castle on

Markle says she hopes to give her 'sentimental wedding present' to Meghan and Harry in person","summary":"She has orchestrated a string of critical interviews, refused a palace plea for her discretion, and claimed responsibility for the photoshoot that brought the royal wedding into headlines for all the wrong reasons. But Meghan Markle\u2019s estranged half sister has not given up hope of seeing her in person for her wedding to Prince Harry. Samantha Grant, whose father is yet to confirm whether or not he will be attending Ms Markle\u2019s wedding to Prince Harry, has said she would still like to give a \u201csentimental\u201d wedding present to the couple in person, despite not being invited to the Windsor Castle celebrations. Thomas Markle, her father, is allegedly undergoing medical treatment for a heart condition which, in the most recent of many pronouncements, he has said will leave him unable to travel to walk his daughter down the aisle. Kensington Palace have not commented on the claims, with observers left mystified over this week's rapidly developing events. \u00a0 Samantha Grant with Meghan Markle before they lost touch On Wednesday, Doria Ragland, Ms Markle\u2019s mother, flew into Heathrow to be by her daughter\u2019s side, in a planned trip that will now take on extra resonance. Ms Ragland, who has spent time with Prince Harry as his relationship with Ms Markle developed, will provide welcome support for the bride-to-be, whose paternal family have caused major disruption to wedding planning this week. She will meet the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ahead of the wedding, now expected to go alone instead of with her ex-husband Mr Markle. Ms Ragland, who is being looked after by staff at Kensington Palace, was met at the airport by Prince Harry\u2019s assistant private secretary Amy Pickerill, with her luggage - including a dress-sized bag from Burberry - taken through Heathrow's VIP Windsor suite. Thomas Markle, with his daughter Meghan Ms Markle\u2019s friends including Jessica Mulroney, a Canadian stylist, have also landed in the UK, for what Royal watchers will now hope are trouble-free final preparations for the wedding on Saturday. Ms Grant, meanwhile, understood another round of media interviews, in which she appeared on Australian television and spoke directly to gossip website TMZ. Asked whether the palace had ever requested her discretion in her words about Ms Markle during an appearance on Sunrise television, her half sister disclosed: \u201cEarly in the year we were asked not to speak to the public, but I\u2019m pretty adamant about it. \u201cIt was my observation that even family members who didn\u2019t speak to the media were made fun of, they were taunted, they were photographed, they were insulted.\u00a0 Meghan Markle with her mother Doria \u201cI\u2019m not giving them license for them to disparage me like that without at least leveling the playing field for intelligent minds.\u201d Referring to Ms Markle, she told TMZ: \u201cThere's something in this country called freedom of speech. \"She doesn't have a copyright on that and she's not going to tell me that I can't speak about my own life and my father's when it's a matter of public self-defence. \u201cThis is not Great Britain and I am a United States citizen and she's way out of her league by telling me she can't speak.\u201d Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will wed on Saturday Credit: Chris Jackson Ms Grant, along with her brother Thomas Markle Jr, have not been invited to the wedding and no longer has any relationship with her half-sister. Asked by an incredulous-sounding reporter whether she had bought a wedding present for Prince Harry and Ms Markle, Ms Grant said she had found \"something that I thought was really sentimental\u201d. \u201cI'd like to give it to her in person,\u201d she said, promising a \u201csurprise\u201d. \u201cBut if not I would certainly send it.\u201d","published_at":1526508970,"content_id":"afcb9046-2d40-3e3f-91dc-68d5569201ab","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/samantha-markle-apos-apos-something-183445786.html","content_published_at":1526495685,"content_time":1526495685,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":3,"vibe_name":"Royal family","vibe_id":"6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":24,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"987b6534-6d83-37c6-a74c-77f2d3970189","post_id":"v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-d23f3f4f-5a22-3b31-8d27-6b5bccc3c78b_a-987b6534-6d83-37c6-a74c-77f2d3970189","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-d23f3f4f-5a22-3b31-8d27-6b5bccc3c78b_a-987b6534-6d83-37c6-a74c-77f2d3970189","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/royal-family\/v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-d23f3f4f-5a22-3b31-8d27-6b5bccc3c78b_a-987b6534-6d83-37c6-a74c-77f2d3970189","author":"nanook","provider":"W","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.wmagazine.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-07-13\/3b1b2940-493c-11e6-a223-8bb45af493ff_64x64-icons_W.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/two-spice-girls-snubbed-royal-193359991.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/chVFkQEFyq86.I7z4UXHTA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/w_988\/2aa140e782590a5865bdf23f0f5b774a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WdD5RwIs5fcEUs1sUi7EZg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDM0O3c9MzE1OTs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/w_988\/2aa140e782590a5865bdf23f0f5b774a","height":2434,"width":3159,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/w_988\/2aa140e782590a5865bdf23f0f5b774a","imgw":3159,"imgh":2434,"title":"Two Spice Girls Snubbed in Royal Wedding Guest Planning","summary":"You can't \"Say you'll be there\" if you're not invited.

After a day of confusion, in which he appeared to change his plans repeatedly, Thomas Markle announced via US celebrity website TMZ that he was due to have an operation and would not attend the Royal wedding on Saturday. It marked a dramatic turn of events and came just hours after an earlier u-turn, in which he said he would be at the wedding.\u00a0 The furore began on Monday when the 73-year-old said he would avoid the ceremony for fear of embarrassing his daughter in the wake of a controversy surrounding his collusion with the paparazzi. However, on Tuesday he raised hopes of attending after all by saying his daughter had been in touch to reassure him, and was prepared to fly to Britain if his medical condition allowed. Mr Markle is reported to have said: \u201cI hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.\u201d But within hours he appeared to change his plans for a third time, claiming he required heart surgery after falling unwell again. He told the site: \"They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed.\" Playing out via TMZ, the abrupt changes raised further fears for Mr Markle\u2019s well-being. Royal wedding countdown in pictures as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's preparations begin Kensington Palace has not commented on any of the claims, repeating only a plea for understanding and respect for Mr Markle. Meghan Markle, he claimed, harbours \u201cno ill feelings\u201d towards him for the unfortunate episode, in which he was exposed for working with the paparazzi despite Kensington Palace\u2019s repeated insistence that he wished to remain private. The confusion leaves plans for the royal wedding in further disarray, irreversibly overshadowing the marriage of Prince Harry and Ms Markle.\u00a0 Markle family His inclusion in the wedding was only confirmed for the first time on May 4, with the 73-year-old planning to fly from his home in Mexico to Britain to meet the Queen and all senior members of the Royal Family before the big day. Instead, on Monday, he disclosed he had pulled out of walking Ms Markle down the St George\u2019s Chapel aisle \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t want to embarrass the Royal family or his daughter\u201d. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: \u201cThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. \u201cShe and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.\u201d In comments that have not been confirmed or denied by the palace, Mr Markle said his daughter had sent him messages telling him that she loved him and was concerned about him. It is understood that neither she or her husband-to-be Prince Harry hold him accountable for his decision to work with the paparazzi, believing him to have been placed under intolerable pressure by their presence. Doria Ragland, Ms Markle\u2019s mother, is flying to Britain, and is expected to meet the Queen this week as planned. She is expected to be the alternative choice to walk Ms Markle down the aisle.

Tracy Dooley - who was married to Meghan Markle's half-brother\u00a0Thomas Markle Jr - was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25,\u00a0and Thomas, 26. Ms Dooley\u00a0has previously told ITV's Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday, admitting she had not seen Ms Markle for 20 years. She is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she \"will be in the front row cheering them on\" in Windsor. The Dooleys took to Facebook to announce their presence in the capital on Monday evening. Meghan Markle's nephews Tyler and Thomas Dooley and their mother Tracy Dooley Markle arrive at Heathrow airport with an unidentified woman Credit: Constant Media Ms Dooley posted pictures of landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye, writing: \"We're here.\u00a0Yay.\" Her son Tyler uploaded an image of the Imperial War Museum, as well as a photograph of the inside of a hotel room. \"Just touched down in London. Man,\u00a0what a journey so far,\" he wrote. \"We're safe and sound.\" Ms Dooley lives in Medford, Oregon, according to her Facebook, but is originally from Calabasas in California.\u00a0 She is listed as a creative advertising and marketing specialist at Opus Broadcasting - a company responsible for a handful of radio stations, according to its website.\u00a0 On May 3, she shared a link to her personal blog, saying she was travelling to London to \"cover all things Royal wedding\". Upon the family's arrival, the Facebook blog page - called Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles - posted a picture of the trio landing at Heathrow with the caption: \"Just glad to have landed safely and hoping for Tom senior to be well, healthy and\u00a0happy. \"I wish the same for Meghan, Prince Harry, my children, friends, family and those who need our prayers and love. Peace, love and good works.\" In April, the blog's page, which appears to be run by Ms Dooley, shared an article headlined \"Meghan Markle snubs nephew and his\u00a0mum with no invite to Royal wedding.\" It was accompanied with the caption: \"Beyond blessed to be any part of this momentous occasion.\u00a0We'll be front and center at Windsor cheering Meghan and Prince Harry on.\"

nice stuff': Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall offer their opinions on the designers in the running to create Meghan Markle's wedding dress","summary":"With just three days to go until the marriage of Prince Harry to Ms Meghan Markle, excitement is naturally mounting about all aspects of the wedding, including which designer Ms Markle has chosen to create her wedding gown. On Wednesday, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the Yoox Net-a-Porter tech hub in West London where they learnt about the possible uses for artificial intelligence in fashion, met 60 schoolgirls taking part in a coding challenge and browsed rails of British and sustainable designs. Conveniently, a few pieces by designers tipped to be making their future daughter-in-law\u2019s dress were amongst the items available for their perusal. \u201cVery nice stuff,\u201d Prince Charles remarked as Alison Loehnis, Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter President, guided Their Royal Highnesses through pieces from Ralph and Russo\u2019s spring\/ summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection. Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo, founders of the only British label to be accepted by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, are thought to have been chosen by Meghan to create her dress for the daytime ceremony. \u201cHow lovely,\u201d added the Duchess of Cornwall, who wore a pale pink wool crepe skirt suit by Bruce Oldfield, when Loehnis pointed out a floral design by Erdem, another of the favourite contenders. Net-a-Porter's Alison Loehnis shows Charles and Camilla design by British labels Credit: Getty Doria Ragland, Ms. Markle\u2019s mother was pictured on Tuesday leaving her home in Los Angeles carrying a Burberry suit bag, leading to speculation that the British luxury house would be outfitting her- and perhaps other members of the bridal party- on the big day. \u201cThat\u2019s charming,\u201d said the Duchess of Cornwall as she was shown checked items by the label, with a glint of recognition when she came to one of Burberry\u2019s signature trench coats, a design classic she owns herself. Among the examples of sustainable fashion which the Prince and Duchess admired during their tour were Danish brand Carcel which offers employment opportunities for women in prisons and is made with a commitment to zero waste. Prince Charles appeared particularly taken with a patchwork shirt by Outerknown, a label which uses recycled plastic and fishing nets in its production- perhaps an option for Saturday evening\u2019s wedding after-party? Royal wedding | Fashion and Beauty Later in the tour, Loehnis and Federico Marchetti, CEO of Yoox Net-a-Porter, demonstrated their vision for a new kind of homepage, powered by artificial intelligence. Bespoke web pages had been created for the Duchess, including suggestions of outfits she may like to wear for any upcoming garden parties or christenings. \u201cWe wanted to share with Their Royal Highnesses a very human side of technology. Today, our guests had the opportunity to see how artificial intelligence can be about warmth, beauty and craftsmanship,\u201d said Marchetti. The Duchess of Cornwall with schoolgirls taking part in the coding challenge Credit: Getty The Tech Hub tour culminated in Their Royal Highnesses meeting 60 girls from local schools in West London who were putting their coding skills to good use in a T-shirt design competition. The initiative which is a partnership between YNAP and Imperial College London aims to encourage more girls to pursue careers in technology. \u201cIt was great to energise the pupils by showing how coding can really impact products like t-shirts,\u201d observed Loehnis. Charles and Camilla are presented with Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter goodie bags Credit: Getty \u201cThey were curious about the brands which we\u2019d put together and I explained how sustainability is increasingly important to our customers,\u201d Loehnis later said of the visit. \u201cI introduced our newest category which is fine jewellery and watches, explaining how customers are now willing to make these big purchases through their smartphones.\u201d Perhaps not a predicament with the royals are familiar with, given their access to a vast collection of crown jewels and family heirlooms. As Charles and Camilla left \u00a0the YNAP Tech Hub, they were presented with three rather large bags containing gifts from Alexander McQueen and Turnbull and Asser. Could they be the perfect finishing touches to their outfits for Saturday\u2019s royal wedding?","published_at":1526484585,"content_id":"d2a34970-c419-3977-8be5-3613f67d53ec","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/apos-very-nice-stuff-apos-172200098.html","content_published_at":1526491320,"content_time":1526491320,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Royal

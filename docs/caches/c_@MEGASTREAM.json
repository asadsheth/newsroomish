The rock, which has been named \"2018 DV1,\" is quite small, measuring just 23 feet in width, and isn't considered a danger to Earth. However, the same can't be said for the much larger asteroid that is right behind it. On March 7th, the asteroid named \"2017 VR12\" will make its closest approach to Earth, coming within around 870,000 miles. That's a much larger buffer zone, but the rock itself is also a great deal more massive than 2018 DV1. 2017 VR12 is thought to measure over 500 feet wide, and might even be as large as 1,500 feet wide based on the most recent observations. That's large enough to warrant a NASA label of \"potentially dangerous.\" According to NASA, both asteroids should pass safely by our planet and aren't expected to cause much of a headache. That's obviously good news, especially since the smaller of the two, 2018 DV1, will actually be quite close when it makes its pass. 70,000 miles is a mere hair's width in cosmic terms, and is well within the orbit of the Moon which orbits at around 240,000 miles. 2018 DV1 is a fairly recent discovery. Asteroids of this size are very hard to spot until they get much closer to Earth, while larger rocks like 2017 VR12 catch the eye of astronomers from a much greater distance. Even if 2018 DV1 were to strike the planet, it's small enough that it would likely not do very much damage, and certainly wouldn't threaten the planet as a whole. 2017 VR12, on the other hand, has some potential to do serious harm if it were to end up in a collision course with our planet. It's considered a medium sized rock, based on the size of asteroids that have been logged in the past, and it's not even in the same league as the really big ones. Still, at as large as 1,500 feet wide, it's not small. Thankfully, it appears it will easily miss us this time around, and NASA says it's not expected to fly back into our neighborhood again for another 177 years or so.","published_at":1519932575,"content_id":"d44ad17c-263b-3a11-8a5f-324968c0f5c7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/pint-sized-asteroid-close-pass-earth-tomorrow-much-192935443.html","content_published_at":1519932575,"content_time":1519932575,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":8,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":2,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03","post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03_a-e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03_a-e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03_a-e74511a9-4c93-3bc8-a947-e9e860e7ee03","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"AOL.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mcdonald-apos-szechuan-sauce-impossible-194953412.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hf43UcnuxcAP54CWwtzemQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/6238995fc2638a25e351b0c362400794","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3lZWd4Py2rFLVPIQlEFIbw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/6238995fc2638a25e351b0c362400794","height":2667,"width":4000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/6238995fc2638a25e351b0c362400794","imgw":4000,"imgh":2667,"title":"McDonald's Szechuan sauce is impossible to get -- and its causing an uproar on the internet","summary":"The McDonald\u2019s Szechuan sauce, a teriyaki-like dipping sauce that was released in 1998 in promotion with the movie \u2018Mulan\u2019,\u00a0is a prime \u2014 if not THE prime \u2014 example of just that.

The Harden step-back three that tends to follow said crossover, is also a staple of the six-time All-Star's game that we are all accustomed to watching go in with regularity.But this play entered another stratosphere in the realm of Harden highlights thanks to the pause he takes before releasing his shot. Harden gives Johnson a chance to stand and the rest of the Clippers the opportunity to contest his shot, but when the entire court stood still, he launched up a three and sent the Rockets' bench (make sure you watch Trevor Ariza running up the sideline all the way to half court) and Twitter into a frenzy.The Beard and the Rockets have been having their way so far in their first game against the Clippers and first game in Los Angeles since reportedly using a back tunnel to get into the Clippers' locker room after a 113-102 loss last month.Harden had 22 points in the first half to help Houston build a 61-43 advantage.","published_at":1519879688,"content_id":"62fc024e-66b5-3bb6-9fd9-1e7cd23b43ee","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/twitter-goes-wild-james-harden-044808721.html","content_published_at":1519879688,"content_time":1519879688,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":425,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":17,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30","post_id":"v-dd114874-7083-393e-8bf1-0ac1f74868c1_c-0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30_a-0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dd114874-7083-393e-8bf1-0ac1f74868c1_c-0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30_a-0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/white-house\/v-dd114874-7083-393e-8bf1-0ac1f74868c1_c-0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30_a-0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"CNN","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/28\/politics\/hope-hicks-analysis\/index.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cvCGvo7sjp1I_c2ObPKh7A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hemSucuBKAW.v4djXXb62Q--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30-947071609.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MWIgH.HbpGZwqwRWREh7zQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MTk7dz0xMTAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hemSucuBKAW.v4djXXb62Q--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30-947071609.jpeg","height":619,"width":1100,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hemSucuBKAW.v4djXXb62Q--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0a4a2c52-e8ff-329c-9a1b-0602cf9b8a30-947071609.jpeg","imgw":1100,"imgh":619,"title":"Hope Hicks' totally ridiculous explanation for why she quit","summary":"Hicks is not only the third Trump White House communications director to resign in just over a year, but she also leaves: * One day after she spent hours testifying in front of the House Intelligence Committee regarding its investigation into Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

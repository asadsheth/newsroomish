Peters' departure was first reported by BuzzFeed News, which obtained a copy of an email announcing his departure and detailing his reasoning to his colleagues.\u00a0 \"Today, I feel that Fox News is assaulting our constitutional order and the rule of law, while fostering corrosive and unjustified paranoia among viewers,\" Peters wrote in the email. \"Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association. Now I am ashamed.\" Peters continued by saying he thought that Fox News \"degenerated from providing a legitimate and much-needed outlet for conservative voices to a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically ruinous administration.\" Hard to believe it took him this long to realize it, but be assured he hasn't had a total change of heart. Peters, who was briefly suspended from the network \u00a0several years ago for calling then President Obama a \"total pussy\" on live TV over his terrorism strategy, used his goodbye letter to take a dig at him one last time while simultaneously bashing Trump and Fox News' hosts. \"As a Russia analyst for many years, it also has appalled me that hosts who made their reputations as super-patriots and who, justifiably, savaged President Obama for his duplicitous folly with Putin, now advance Putin's agenda by making light of Russian penetration of our elections and the Trump campaign,\" Peters wrote.\u00a0 Fox News wasn't just going to let Peters trash talk the network, however, saying he was using his opinion \"as a weapon in order to gain attention.\" NEW - Statement from Fox News on Ralph Peters email: \"Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention.

Stephanie Soriano said she unknowingly poisoned herself with her regimen of over-the-counter drugs to beat the illness in January, news station WJW reported. \u201cI was taking Tylenol during the day [and] towards the evening as well,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cAt nighttime, so I could sleep, I took NyQuil. Then, I would wake up around 2 to 3 in the morning and take Theraflu as well.\u201d But days later, her health was seemingly worse and she was rushed to University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, according to WJW. \u201cI was coming in and out of consciousness,\u201d she told the news station.

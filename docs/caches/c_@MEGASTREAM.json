along with a photo from when he awarded Hawking with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. Obama is the latest high-profile individual to weigh in on the devastating loss of the scientist, a man who forever changed the world with his groundbreaking work across a number of disciplines. Despite being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in 1963, Hawking spent more than a half century continuing on with his work \u2014 even going so far as to use a computer to enable him to continue speaking to others after being paralyzed.","published_at":1521111342,"content_id":"b02e9818-6ef3-38ab-8318-6996b3c426d2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Barack-Obama-Tweet-Stephen-Hawking-Death-March-2018-44666615","content_published_at":1521111342,"content_time":1521111342,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":11,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":5,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/donald-trump\/v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"POPSUGAR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Trump-Tweet-About-Obama-Staff-Turnover-Rate-44666788","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cdk2qZGBJOBAfGkGC2BlnQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0usQsnybJ0sht0i5FwrcuA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"This Old Trump Tweet Is Coming Back to Haunt Him \u2014 Because, Well, Just Read It","summary":"It's no secret that President Donald Trump isn't the best at keeping officials in his administration around for very long.

First, the Seahawks traded Michael Bennett to the Philadelphia Eagles and not long after decided to release Richard Sherman, who quickly found a new home in San Francisco with the NFC West rival 49ers. Now, Earl Thomas could become\u00a0the latest player to depart the Pacific Northwest. Thomas' future in Seattle has been murky dating back to last season. Following a Week 16 game in Dallas against the Cowboys, the Seahawks safety was captured chatting with Jason Garrett, telling the Cowboys coach that his team should \u201ccome get him\u201d if it could.

And it was very emotional (obviously). We all expected Kate to honor her late father on the big day \u2014 and she did it in a not-so-obvious way. Some thought Kevin would lend her his necklace.

It has a great cast, but I found it to be a bit bland overall. I may be in the minority opinion there, however, as the film was being sold as \u201cso terrifying that Netflix users were saying they had to turn it off.\u201d Well, it turns out that may be a fairly common thing. Netflix has actually just sent me a list of ten films that their data shows them are similarly scary\/horrifying that their users can't actually make it all the way through them. The criteria was that Netflix users made it at least 70% of the way through the movie, but turned it off en masse before finishing it.

Betty Pina, a former military helicopter pilot who flew combat missions in Afghanistan, told KIRO 7\u00a0that during an overnight stay in Minneapolis, the pilot spiked her wine with an unknown substance and she woke up in his bedroom. \"And I'm like, 'Where am I' and immediately I sit up and realize my bra and top is on and I'm sliding off the bed. It's wet and I smell vomit and the blankets and sheets are gathered up at the end of the bed. And I realize my pants and underwear are off,\u201d Pina said of the alleged attack.","published_at":1521028380,"content_id":"4e7c6241-06ee-3aca-912e-fd3ab8ba1bd4","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/travel\/2018\/03\/14\/alaska-airlines-female-co-pilot-claims-male-pilot-drugged-and-raped-her.amp.html","content_published_at":1521028380,"content_time":1521028380,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":19,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df","post_id":"v-050765ad-94f9-3623-bbc7-8ee60ac71887_c-b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df_a-b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-050765ad-94f9-3623-bbc7-8ee60ac71887_c-b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df_a-b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/government-agencies\/v-050765ad-94f9-3623-bbc7-8ee60ac71887_c-b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df_a-b4e57eaa-5be8-36f0-8356-f487a96cc3df","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/oklahoma-become-first-u-state-nitrogen-gas-executions-005019308.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Oklahoma to become first U.S. state to use nitrogen gas for executions","summary":"The state is turning to nitrogen after it and other states became unable to acquire drugs required for lethal injections because of opposition from manufacturers to their products being used for capital punishment.

We've already spent countless hours wondering how they'll proceed. Which of the four quarterbacks will it be? Will they make a move for Penn State running back Saquon Barkley? Could they take a pass rusher for a second straight year? So, of course, the Browns decided to change everything last week by making a flurry of trades, the most important of which saw them land a better-than-average starting quarterback in Tyrod Taylor.

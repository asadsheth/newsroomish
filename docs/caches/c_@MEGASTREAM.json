More than 200 businessmen, princes and government officials were detained in November and imprisoned at the luxury hotel in Riyadh in what the Saudi government said was an anti-corruption drive.\u00a0 According to the New York Times, some of the powerful detainees may have suffered abuse at the hands of their captors as they were coerced into agreements to hand over billions of dollars to the Saudi government in return for their freedom.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia has dismissed the allegations of abuse as \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d.\u00a0 The most dramatic accusation involves Major General Ali al-Qahtani, an aide to a senior Saudi prince seen as a potential rival to the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed, who died in government custody in mid-December.\u00a0 The report was published shortly before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for meetings with the Trump administration Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ Saudi Royal Palace \/ BANDAR AL-JALOUD Sources told the newspaper that the general\u2019s \u201cneck was twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken\u201d and that his body had burn marks which appeared to be the result of electric shocks.\u00a0 General Qahtani was taken to hospital in November but was reportedly returned to his interrogation after being seen by doctors. The government has not offered an official explanation for how he died.\u00a0 The general\u2019s death had been widely reported in Arab and Iranian media previously but not in detail. The US report comes shortly before Prince Mohammed, known by his initials \u201cMBS\u201d, is due in Washington for meetings with the Trump administration.\u00a0 General Qahtani was an aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh who is from a rival line of the Saudi royal family to Prince Mohammed. Prince Turki was himself detained during the November crackdown on allegations of corruption. He was eventually released.

Facebook to exclusively stream 25 MLB games a year","summary":"WASHINGTON (AFP)\u00a0-\u00a0 Facebook and Major League Baseball announced on Friday that the social media giant will exclusively stream 25 MLB games this season. The move marks the first time that one of the major US professional sports leagues has agreed to have regular season games distributed only on Facebook. It is also the latest salvo in a battle between Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo to add more sports content to their online offerings. Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo have been streaming some National Football League (NFL) games and Facebook live-streamed 20 MLB games last season, but they were simulcasts of local television broadcasts.

The financial terms of Uehara's deal were not revealed. The 42-year-old right-handed closer helped the Boston Red Sox win the World Series in 2013 when he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series. He spent nine seasons in MLB, compiling 95 saves and a 2.66 ERA. Prior to going to the U.S., Uehara was a member of the Giants from 1999 to 2008 and was a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award, Japan's version of the Cy Young Award. Last season, Uehara pitched in 49 games for the Chicago Cubs, winning three, losing four and saving two with a 3.98 ERA.

Not a problem, apparently. Although Florial isn't looming as large on the radar as fellow top prospect Miguel Andujar, he's hardly flying under it, either. The 20-year-old center fielder from the Dominican Republic has played in eight games and put together a 1.089 OPS, in part thanks to a league-leading three triples. For many, this is the first real glimpse at one of the most helium-filled prospects in Major League Baseball.","published_at":1520366645,"content_id":"2c1351a7-0582-3d0a-bec5-e52b52a7142c","content_url":"https:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2762752-yankees-20-year-old-phenom-estevan-florial-has-future-5-tool-mlb-star-power","content_published_at":1520337601,"content_time":1520337601,"content_relative_time":221,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":221,"comment_relative_time":221,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1dcbe5d2-d877-3178-9579-631cfb13dafd","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-09619fa9-3000-34ec-a163-e3e7f47d933f_a-1dcbe5d2-d877-3178-9579-631cfb13dafd","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-09619fa9-3000-34ec-a163-e3e7f47d933f_a-1dcbe5d2-d877-3178-9579-631cfb13dafd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/mlb-opening-day-2018-schedule-hp8k1j9","author":"nanook","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/mlb-opening-day-2018-schedule-173946908.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2WfajR3K9WC6haZ__GhxJQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/0a9aa01a4c4b7d5545d56273250dcd68","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tcnJdifc1554XPP66iA7fQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/0a9aa01a4c4b7d5545d56273250dcd68","height":1080,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/0a9aa01a4c4b7d5545d56273250dcd68","imgw":1920,"imgh":1080,"title":"MLB Opening Day 2018: Schedule for all 30 teams","summary":"2018 features the earliest Opening Day in Major League Baseball history.","published_at":1520361976,"content_id":"1dcbe5d2-d877-3178-9579-631cfb13dafd","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/mlb-opening-day-2018-schedule-173946908.html","content_published_at":1520362047,"content_time":1520362047,"content_relative_time":214,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":214,"comment_relative_time":214,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-34705bc6-5237-3e8b-a948-2065091e267c_a-fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-34705bc6-5237-3e8b-a948-2065091e267c_a-fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/mlb-power-rankings-defending-world-2nzju3u","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/mlb\/2018\/03\/06\/mlb-power-rankings-preseason-astros\/396349002\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ilpsiB2n6KQ3QtHTuUVrqg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/12eAR_RmrsmTgFHstTNRvw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119-1490298613.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/t7S8Bk7iVLlzojLfXnd6nA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/12eAR_RmrsmTgFHstTNRvw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119-1490298613.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/12eAR_RmrsmTgFHstTNRvw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119-1490298613.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"MLB power rankings: Defending World Series champion Astros begin season at No. 1","summary":"SportsPulse: As Bryce Harper enters a contract year, the Nationals realize it's possibly now or never for a World Series run.

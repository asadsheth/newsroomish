Daniels acknowledged the obvious: disappointment with a record that dropped to 18-31 with a 10-5 loss to the New York Yankees on Monday at Globe Life Park. Bartolo Colon allowed four homers, two by rookie second baseman Gleyber Torres, for the second time in his last four starts. \"It's been a mixed bag,'' Daniels said. \"Some positive signs with our young players. Some guys scuffling a little bit. \"We said from day one it was critical, the development of these young guys.

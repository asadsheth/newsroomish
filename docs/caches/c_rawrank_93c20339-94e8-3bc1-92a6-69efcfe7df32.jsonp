For Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday combined, the drop was bigger \u2014 down 1.6 percent from 2016. Notably, fewer stores opened on Thanksgiving Day, said Brian Field, senior director of advisory services for ShopperTrak, who said years of data showed that opening on Thanksgiving Day pulled shopping excursions from Black Friday. But the Thursday store closures had the opposite effect. Still, plenty of shoppers hit stores and malls, and many were apparently buying guns.

President Barack Obama opted to spend most Thanksgivings with his family in their upstairs residence at the White House, where Obama's favorite dessert -- pie -- was always abundant, in at least six different flavors. The Obama family also spent some Thanksgivings volunteering at shelters and serving food to the homeless and at-risk veterans. President George W. Bush spent his Thanksgivings in office at both Camp David and his Crawford, Texas, ranch with his family.

It is the latest example of a trip that will prove costly to American taxpayers taken by a commander-in-chief who promised to cut back on frivolous spending across the federal government. Some estimates have pegged the cost of a single round-trip to the estate at $3.6 million, but a more conservative estimate is roughly $2 million per trip, a total mostly made up of the costs to fly on Air Force One, according to The Washington Post.

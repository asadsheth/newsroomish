his mother and his friend before escaping the scene \u2014 possibly leaving the state. Casey Lawhorn called the East Ridge Police Department and told officers he shot his mother, Vi Lawhorn, and his friend, Avery Gaines, early Sunday morning before he drove off, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported. In the now-removed\u00a0Facebook\u00a0post, Lawhorn wrote\u00a0that he shot and killed both adults \"with a stolen .22 [long rifle].\" Mississippi's Jasper County Sheriff's Department said on Sunday evening that Lawhorn's car was found abandoned on Interstate 59, but that Lawhorn was not in the vehicle.","published_at":1523224193,"content_id":"61588ee1-192d-3e95-bfd0-a88f833724f8","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/04\/08\/manhunt-for-tennessee-man-23-who-admits-killed-his-mother-and-his-friend.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fnational+%28Internal+-+US+Latest+-+Text%29","content_published_at":1523236440,"content_time":1523236440,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":17,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

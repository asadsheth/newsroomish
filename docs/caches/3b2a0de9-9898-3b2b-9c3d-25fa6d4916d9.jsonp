The influx of banned insects and animals - which also include snakes, spiders, beetles and tortoises - has prompted fears that the new arrivals could harm China's biodiversity and farming output, or even be used by terrorists. Illicit traffickers evade customs inspectors by only packing small amounts of live animals each time, but the overall trade has been described as \"rampant\" by Chinese media. Authorities have issued warnings against importers and enforced tighter border controls in response to the trade, which has also caused alarm among animal rights groups. More than 42,000 mail and parcel deliveries of banned animals and plants were seized at Chinese ports last year, and harmful species were identified in 5,147 of them, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said. Chinese pet owners are driving a boom in illicit imports of everything from scorpions to beatles A statement posted on the China Quality news website, which is affiliated to the organisation, added: \"They may have no natural enemies in China, so they will likely reproduce in great numbers and pose a serious threat to indigenous species and harm China's ecology, biodiversity and agricultural production if they are not properly taken care of.\" Customs officials also identified that some species, such as the Brazilian \u201ckiller scorpion\u201d, poison dart frogs and poisonous snakes, could be dangerous to the public, or even be \"used by terrorists\", the China Daily said. Pet owning was banned in China under revolutionary leader Mao Tze-tung, who believed it was a bourgeoisie hobby.\u00a0But the rise in urbanisation and Western trends has seen dogs and cats being welcomed into many homes. Families often lavish huge amounts of cash on their pets in China, where there are pet hotels, pet cemeteries and even facilities for pet acupuncture.\u00a0However, Chinese animal lovers are now becoming more adventurous in the species they want to own. Reports in China suggest there is a growing trend for monkeys, foxes and reptiles being traded in China. Pa Chongle, a store run at South China Agricultural University which breeds lizards and snakes, generates 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,300) a month through sales, student Li Yiqun said. \"A lizard costs from 100 to 600 yuan (\u00a312- 70) and a snake from 250 to 800 yuan (\u00a329-93) and we usually sell them when they are a month old,\" Mr Li told The Telegraph. He said most of the animals at Pa Chongle, which roughly translates to 'Crawl Lovers', are sold to \"young white collar workers\". The cross-border trade in animals is tightly regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which China has signed. Animal welfare activists say the illegal transportation of animals can be brutal and cause massive harm to the eco-system where the animal was taken from. Sun Quanhui, from World Animal Protection, said: \"Driven by Chinese demand for having wild animals as pets, each year tens of thousands of wild animals are forced to leave their natural habitat areas and become victims of the wild animal trade. \"These animals are mistreated repeatedly during the capture, transportation and trade process. Batches have died, and those which are lucky enough to survive have lost their freedom and have no way back to their natural habitat.\" Wendy Higgins, from the Humane Society International, said animals endured \"stress, malnutrition, dehydration, and long periods of confinement\" during the transportation. \"And for those who do survive, their suffering can continue as a pet because most people have no idea how to provide the complex environmental or dietary needs of these animals,\" Ms Higgins added. \"Exotic wild animals belong in the wild where they can thrive in the freedom of their natural environment. Their home is not in our home.\" Despite the legal and ethical concerns over cross-border trading of wild animals, The Telegraph found many foreign species being sold openly on the Chinese Internet, including turtles from Brazil, Arctic foxes from the \"North Pole\" and widow spiders from Laos. The spider dealer offered to mail the arachnid from his store in Ningbo, in China's east, to Beijing, within three days, once payment of 90 yuan (\u00a310.50) was received. \"They are definitely from Laos because there are no males in China, so reproduction is impossible,\" the dealer told The Telegraph. When asked how he got the spider into China, he said: \"We have our own sources\".

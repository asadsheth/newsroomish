grid, nearly everything is controlled by computers, and those systems haven't gotten more secure since Russian government hackers triggered an electrical outage in Ukraine over a year ago. Now there are indications that North Korea may be working to follow Russia's lead, and sizing up the U.S. as a target. The company analyzed 163 new security vulnerabilities that surfaced last year in industrial-control components, and found that 61 percent of them would likely cause \u201csevere operational impact\u201d if exploited in a cyberattack. Most of the vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the attacker has already gained access to a plant operations network\u2014only 15 percent actually allow an attacker ingress from the outside.","published_at":1519909523,"content_id":"c5907d36-ae1d-3053-9283-76f4343bd28a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/north-korean-hackers-may-be-developing-malware-that-could-shut-down-the-us-power-grid?source=articles_sum&via=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29","content_published_at":1519903836,"content_time":1519903836,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2ae2e628-65ae-324b-a052-7c3ded91ccb2","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-bda17d14-1309-3049-bea9-275a23b5afb0_a-2ae2e628-65ae-324b-a052-7c3ded91ccb2","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-bda17d14-1309-3049-bea9-275a23b5afb0_a-2ae2e628-65ae-324b-a052-7c3ded91ccb2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-bda17d14-1309-3049-bea9-275a23b5afb0_a-2ae2e628-65ae-324b-a052-7c3ded91ccb2","author":"third_watch","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/japan-no-position-declare-comfort-women-issue-settled-020133568.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/n0NXk4G3aqjX.3k9sN.XuQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-03-01T025903Z_2_LYNXNPEE2027J_RTROPTP_2_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mUL13aDtardpaioEzTtxjQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-03-01T025903Z_2_LYNXNPEE2027J_RTROPTP_2_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES.JPG","height":300,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-03-01T025903Z_2_LYNXNPEE2027J_RTROPTP_2_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":300,"title":"South Korean president lashes Japan over wartime use of 'comfort women'","summary":"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in described Japan's wartime use of \"comfort women\" as a \"crime against humanity\" on Thursday in some of his strongest comments yet, sparking an immediate protest from his key ally in containing North Korea.

Syrian forces have dramatically escalated their attacks on the area, which is mostly controlled by rebel forces who for five years have opposed President Bashar al-Assad's rule. Human rights observers say thousands are injured and more than 500 people \u2014 including around 120 children \u2014 have died during the uptick in fighting, marking this as one of the bloodiest stretches of the eight-year Syrian civil war. The offensive highlights a grim reality about the current state of the war: Assad is winning and has now turned his attention to retaking parts of the country he lost.","published_at":1519817758,"content_id":"a8aefb5b-71ce-356b-9019-0ac7ad930cf0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/2\/28\/17057736\/syria-eastern-ghouta-attack-assad","content_published_at":1519794000,"content_time":1519794000,"content_relative_time":61,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":61,"comment_relative_time":61,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f2004a20-8843-3bfe-9256-23b769bce514","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-d7012a51-da1f-30c7-bf29-aeb36480a69e_a-f2004a20-8843-3bfe-9256-23b769bce514","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-d7012a51-da1f-30c7-bf29-aeb36480a69e_a-f2004a20-8843-3bfe-9256-23b769bce514","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-d7012a51-da1f-30c7-bf29-aeb36480a69e_a-f2004a20-8843-3bfe-9256-23b769bce514","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-apos-shipping-chemical-040350160.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iSSxDHKXQuuYAbigmPkSgQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/e0c8ce487b95f5c8d21a2f1235b9a43b","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BvhFUtUf5hoGhVOqwbCB6w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/e0c8ce487b95f5c8d21a2f1235b9a43b","height":1563,"width":2501,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/e0c8ce487b95f5c8d21a2f1235b9a43b","imgw":2501,"imgh":1563,"title":"North Korea shipping chemical weapons supplies to Syria,\u00a0United Nations investigators say","summary":"North Korea has shipped\u00a0supplies to the Syrian government that could be used to make chemical weapons,\u00a0United Nations investigators have revealed. The disclosure, in a confidential 200-page long report seen by the New York Times, comes as the US and other countries have accused Syria of using chemical weapons on its own civilians, including a suspected chlorine gas attack in Eastern Ghouta in the past few days. The report indicates there have been major flaws in international efforts to isolate both countries, and the new evidence could dampen efforts to bring North Korea to the negotiating table following a diplomatic d\u00e9tente at the South Korean Winter Olympics. The items provided by North Korea reportedly included acid-resistant tiles, valves and thermometers. Investigators also detailed sightings of North Korean technicians working at chemical weapons and missile facilities inside Syria. The report appears to confirm long-standing fears that Pyongyang may be funding its own weapons of mass destruction programme by trading its technological expertise with third parties. It also supports suspicions since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 that President Bashar al-Assad has been assisted by the North Korean regime. People receive treatment at a hospital after alleged chlorine gas attack earlier this month Credit: Getty The possible chemical weapons components were part of at least 40 previously unreported shipments from\u00a0North Korea to Syria between 2012 and 2017 of prohibited ballistic missile parts and materials that could be used either for civilian or military purposes. The UN declined to comment on the report, which was written by a panel of eight experts tasked with checking North Korea\u2019s compliance with sanctions. It may never be publicly released, but a spokesperson stressed that the \u201coverarching message is that all member states have a duty and responsibility to abide by the sanctions that are in place.\u201d Experts who reviewed the document for the Times described it as the most detailed account to date of efforts to circumvent sanctions intended to curb the military powers of both countries. Syria war timeline But they concluded that it did not prove definitively that there was current, continuing collaboration between North Korea and Syria on chemical weapons. Hopes have been rising on the Korean peninsula that talks between South and North Korea over the Olympic Games could be expanded to include the US and eventually lead to a breakthrough over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and weapons programme. On Tuesday, senior US diplomat, Joseph Yun told South Korean newswire Yonhap that he remained \u201cvery hopeful\u201d about the prospect of talks.

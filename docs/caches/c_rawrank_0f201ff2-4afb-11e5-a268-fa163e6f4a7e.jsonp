thanks Trump for intelligence that prevented St Petersburg terror attack","summary":"\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin called US\u00a0President Donald Trump on Sunday to thank the Central Intelligence Agency for relaying information that lead to the arrest of several individuals since Friday suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in St. Petersburg.\u00a0 According to the Kremlin, the information shared by the CIA \u201chelped to track, identify and detain a group of terrorists preparing to set off explosions in St. Petersburg\u2019s Kazan Cathedral, as well as in other public areas,\u201d Interfax news agency reported. Mr Putin asked Mr Trump to relay his thanks to the director of the CIA and the intelligence officers who first received the information. Over the past several days, authorities in St. Petersburg have detained five individuals as part of a terrorism investigation. On Friday, authorities arrested Yevgeny Yefimov, who told a court that he has illegally manufactured explosives and intended to detonate them in Kazan Cathedral on Dec. 17. An associate of Yefimov\u2019s was detained on Saturday in connection to the plot. Three more were arrested on Sunday as part of the investigation. They have been identified in the Russian press as Shamil Omargadzhiyev of Russia\u2019s Dagestan region, Alishkhan Esmurziyev of Russia\u2019s Ingushetia region, and Firuz Kalavurov, a citizen of neighboring Tajikistan. The Federal Security Service (FSB) on Friday also said it had arrested seven members of an Islamic State cell. The agency made a point in its statement of highlighting that the cell was being directed from abroad via Telegram, a popular encrypted messaging app \u2014 leading some to speculate the arrests could be used as a pretence to crack down on the application\u2019s use. Earlier this year, in April, a suicide bomber attacked the St. Petersburg metro. A second, unexploded device was found in a metro station in another part of the city. The attacks highlighted a growing threat of terrorism in Russia, as many Russian-speaking Islamic State fighters began to try to return home from the battlefields of Syria. Mr Putin, according to the Kremlin, told Mr Trump that Russia\u2019s security services would \u201cundoubtedly and without delay\u201d share information pertaining to terrorist threats against the U.S. and its citizens in the future.","published_at":1513613791,"content_id":"e912af8e-2015-3371-a234-5c1cb1dc9a19","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/putin-thanks-trump-intelligence-prevented-183602906.html","content_published_at":1513535762,"content_time":1513535762,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ac94b910-0031-33b1-88a2-74ec4b4b4251","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-22c7a76d-334e-3742-b593-8cece8f3fe1e_a-ac94b910-0031-33b1-88a2-74ec4b4b4251","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-22c7a76d-334e-3742-b593-8cece8f3fe1e_a-ac94b910-0031-33b1-88a2-74ec4b4b4251","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/mystery-swirls-around-powerful-north-2w8diut","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"AOL.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mystery-swirls-around-powerful-north-035535070.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kGVf4h8LVv_rDu0IMz4.OQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/62d829c740cbab635cb5bf5cf8ccd391","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/atmEXnsvRH0mT928Wi4uEw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjYzO3c9MjUwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/62d829c740cbab635cb5bf5cf8ccd391","height":1663,"width":2500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/62d829c740cbab635cb5bf5cf8ccd391","imgw":2500,"imgh":1663,"title":"Mystery swirls around powerful North Korea official as Hwang Pyong-so remains missing","summary":"A North Korean official widely deemed as the nation\u2019s\u00a0second\u00a0most powerful figure has been missing for some time, raising speculation that he has been executed.","published_at":1513483171,"content_id":"ac94b910-0031-33b1-88a2-74ec4b4b4251","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mystery-swirls-around-powerful-north-035535070.html","content_published_at":1513482935,"content_time":1513482935,"content_relative_time":39,"reaction_count":5,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":39,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"935f74c4-eaca-3d59-9af2-c8886072e2af","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-2d295ecd-ea5c-35af-8154-d3f3b9c5d960_a-935f74c4-eaca-3d59-9af2-c8886072e2af","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-2d295ecd-ea5c-35af-8154-d3f3b9c5d960_a-935f74c4-eaca-3d59-9af2-c8886072e2af","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/freedom-wounded-n-korean-soldier-defected-means-100-172105773--abc-news-topstories-59hg0o7","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/freedom-wounded-n-korean-soldier-defected-means-100-172105773--abc-news-topstories.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TqLum1Ij414fqhDlSECKKg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/choco-pie-korean-ht-thg-171218_16x9_992.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bdpULLbVd15FMaWx4S6zHw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTg7dz05OTI7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/choco-pie-korean-ht-thg-171218_16x9_992.jpg","height":558,"width":992,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/choco-pie-korean-ht-thg-171218_16x9_992.jpg","imgw":992,"imgh":558,"title":"Freedom for wounded N.

It was the fastest expansion since 2011, when incomes rose by more than seven percent, a graph issued by Statistics Korea on Friday showed, and came despite the imposition of multiple sets of international sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme. The isolated North is one of the world's most secretive countries and does not release official economic data, not even for GDP growth, leaving observers to compile estimates of their own.","published_at":1513620996,"content_id":"c1b33efd-4694-30c7-b99d-d49238f5a610","content_url":"http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20171218-n-korean-incomes-improving-but-far-below-south-seoul","content_published_at":1513561564,"content_time":1513561564,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":17,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b6d309ad-59d1-30ac-8587-d0b2df6b546b","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-740a09f7-3cac-3800-896e-9d816544a55c_a-b6d309ad-59d1-30ac-8587-d0b2df6b546b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-740a09f7-3cac-3800-896e-9d816544a55c_a-b6d309ad-59d1-30ac-8587-d0b2df6b546b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-740a09f7-3cac-3800-896e-9d816544a55c_a-b6d309ad-59d1-30ac-8587-d0b2df6b546b","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters Videos","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/australia-arrests-man-accused-trying-085846956.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/q5pAaYKfiZLnHuu6adKQ2g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.reutersnews.com\/2017-12-17T085846Z_1_LOP000JGEH92T_RTRMADP_BASEIMAGE-960X540_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES-AUSTRALIA.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cljxZYxR8ZMWh0sTvCKNsQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NDA7dz05NjA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.reutersnews.com\/2017-12-17T085846Z_1_LOP000JGEH92T_RTRMADP_BASEIMAGE-960X540_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES-AUSTRALIA.JPG","height":540,"width":960,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.reutersnews.com\/2017-12-17T085846Z_1_LOP000JGEH92T_RTRMADP_BASEIMAGE-960X540_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES-AUSTRALIA.JPG","imgw":960,"imgh":540,"title":"Australia arrests man accused of trying to sell missile parts for North Korea","summary":null,"published_at":1513519904,"content_id":"b6d309ad-59d1-30ac-8587-d0b2df6b546b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/australia-arrests-man-accused-trying-085846956.html","content_published_at":1513501126,"content_time":1513501126,"content_relative_time":34,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"video_link","aspect":1.7800000000000000266453525910037569701671600341796875},"created_at":0,"comment_time":34,"comment_relative_time":34,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

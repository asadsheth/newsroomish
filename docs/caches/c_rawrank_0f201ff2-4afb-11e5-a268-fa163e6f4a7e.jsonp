Trump's surprise announcement on Thursday that the US will institute tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has upset stock markets, angered US allies around the world and even drawn criticism from members of his own party -- but whether it represents the start of a global trade war is likely to depend on China's reaction. Beijing's immediate response Friday was measured in tone -- urging the US \"to abide by the multilateral trade rules and make contributions to the international trade and economic order\" -- and concerns about potential retaliation for the tariffs have largely centered on China imposing its own punishing economic measures.","published_at":1520286193,"content_id":"894562bc-bac1-3c7c-98b2-097dbd84fc5c","content_url":"https:\/\/us.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/03\/politics\/trump-trade-war-china-geopolitical-reaction\/index.html","content_published_at":1520057202,"content_time":1520057202,"content_relative_time":86,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":86,"comment_relative_time":86,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-35970f35-fde8-3080-94b2-b5bd361ed615_a-0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-35970f35-fde8-3080-94b2-b5bd361ed615_a-0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-35970f35-fde8-3080-94b2-b5bd361ed615_a-0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749","author":"third_watch","provider":"UPI","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Top_News\/US\/2018\/03\/05\/Gallup-North-Korea-cyberterrorism-considered-top-threats-to-US\/6641520260277\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fuA_NneopLARmjFAdfji1A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l_DXkOIt.P8ySxFnddMNwA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749-706621987.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ka5uxZX4dN26fLGTSnpoQA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTg7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l_DXkOIt.P8ySxFnddMNwA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749-706621987.jpeg","height":398,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/l_DXkOIt.P8ySxFnddMNwA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0414b8c6-7bb0-3280-8ac1-f71855a11749-706621987.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":398,"title":"Gallup: North Korea, cyberterrorism considered top threats to U.S.","summary":"March 5 (UPI) -- More than 80 percent of Americans think North Korea and cyber-based terrorism are the most critical threats to the United States, a new Gallup Poll Monday showed.

Decades ago, North Korea presented it to Egypt to commemorate the 1973 war against Israel, when North Korean pilots fought and died on the Egyptian side. But now the statue has come to signify another aspect of Egypt's ties to North Korea: a furtive trade in illegal weapons that has upset President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's otherwise cozy relationship with the United States, set off a painful cut in military aid, and drawn unremitting scrutiny from UN inspectors.

Talks at Monday's\u00a0dinner were centred on a possible summit between the two nation\u2019s leaders, raising hopes of a breakthrough on the hermit kingdom\u2019s nuclear programme. A report by the official Korean Central News Agency said Mr Kim told the delegation he wanted to \"write a new history of reunification\" and also\u00a0discussed how to ease military tensions in the region. \u201cHearing the intention of President Moon Jae-in for a summit from the special envoy of the south side, he exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement,\u201d it said after yesterday\u2019s meeting without detailing what that agreement was. Mr Moon, the South Korean president, had dispatched Chung Eui-yong, his national security head, and Suh Hoon, his intelligence chief, to lead a 10-member delegation on a two-day trip to the North Korean capital.

Mr Kim\u2019s dinner invitation was confirmed by South Korea\u2019s presidential office, who said that it began at 6pm local time. The envoys were carrying a letter from Mr Moon to hand to their host. Photos provided by the president\u2019s office, also known by the Blue House, showed the delegation walking resolutely in dark suits across the tarmac after landing in Pyongyang after the short flight from Seoul. They were welcomed by Ri Son-gwon, chief of a North Korean agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. \u201cI plan to hold in-depth discussions on various ways to continue talks between not only the South and the North, but also the North and the United States and the international community,\u201d Mr Chung said shortly before his departure. Mr Moon and his aides have repeatedly stressed the importance of talks between Washington and Pyongyang, and for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. things facts you didn't know about north korea The issue has been a sticking point in finding a diplomatic resolution to ongoing tensions about Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The North Korean foreign ministry issued a statement at the weekend mocking US demands that it denuclearise as \u201cmore than ridiculous.\u201d Analysts, however, pointed out that while the envoys\u2019 visit could\u00a0facilitate a future\u00a0leaders summit, that the nuclear issue could not be avoided. \u201cMoon clearly wants to go,\u201d said Robert Kelly, professor of political science at South Korea\u2019s Busan University. \u201cThe real trick is making sure the North Koreans don\u2019t turn a summit into an anti-American prestige-seeking one. It\u2019s got to deal with the nuclear weapons one way or another.\u201d","published_at":1520238090,"content_id":"c08aa3a5-f902-3ab2-9eef-f3484c311d52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/kim-jong-un-surprise-move-100653065.html","content_published_at":1520293370,"content_time":1520293370,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean

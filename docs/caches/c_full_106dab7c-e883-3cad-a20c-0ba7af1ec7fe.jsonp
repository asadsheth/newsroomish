Researchers from Germany's Technical University of Munich want to help, however\u00a0\u2014 and they are turning to some of the same A.I. tools to help them in their fight. What they have developed is an algorithm called XceptionNet that quickly spots faked videos posted online.","published_at":1523569252,"content_id":"22c170fa-75e5-3cc2-9c5e-c62f8937c09c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/cool-tech\/face-swap-recognition-algorithm\/","content_published_at":1523567235,"content_time":1523567235,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence","vibe_id":"106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":22,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"711b6581-85f8-3221-9ff7-adc0f55e7a0c","post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-d506d9e1-2abd-3c6a-8c17-f9a445fe0ee4_a-711b6581-85f8-3221-9ff7-adc0f55e7a0c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-d506d9e1-2abd-3c6a-8c17-f9a445fe0ee4_a-711b6581-85f8-3221-9ff7-adc0f55e7a0c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/discriminating-algorithms-5-times-ai-552uuai","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"New Scientist","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/?p=2166207","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Discriminating algorithms: 5 times AI showed prejudice","summary":"Modern life runs on intelligent algorithms.

League' Was A Sad Failure In Studio Leadership","summary":"Warner Bros.' big-budget superhero team-up event film Justice League has finally completed its theatrical run worldwide, and is available on home entertainment. With $656 million in global receipts, the film became one of the year's biggest financial disappointments at the box office and another poorly received entry in the studio's struggling attempts to get their shared DC Comics cinematic universe on firmer footing. While there are plenty of factors contributing to\u00a0Justice League's inglorious financial outcome, the bottom line is this: the film's failure was due to a failure in leadership. A combination of overall bad reviews and weak audience grades hurt Justice League's performance, as did the baggage it carried from the troubled critical and audience reception of its direct narrative predecessor Batman v Superman\u00a0(which I'll always defend as being far, far better than its reputation).","published_at":1521808628,"content_id":"a9b3dd1e-2afb-3c31-8c13-4c4efa6db38d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/markhughes\/2018\/03\/23\/justice-league-was-a-sad-failure-in-studio-leadership\/","content_published_at":1521808200,"content_time":1521808200,"content_relative_time":10,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":10,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0ae1e79c-ce4a-3de0-9ec9-2dcc085bad6d","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-4ae4f270-fa11-34b6-9ef3-8239098ea1ce_a-0ae1e79c-ce4a-3de0-9ec9-2dcc085bad6d","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-4ae4f270-fa11-34b6-9ef3-8239098ea1ce_a-0ae1e79c-ce4a-3de0-9ec9-2dcc085bad6d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/terminal-trailer-starring-margot-robbie-66cwfh3","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Den of Geek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\/uk\/movies\/terminal\/56261\/terminal-trailer-starring-margot-robbie-and-simon-pegg","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0nqQ15CmAPv5fMMz9cRSRw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LTc6w.fjMqIm59RpO2PkeQ--\/dz0zMDAwO2g9MTY5Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0ae1e79c-ce4a-3de0-9ec9-2dcc085bad6d--1658211502.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kYI8osIeVB1TNo_t2hLByA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjk3O3c9MzAwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LTc6w.fjMqIm59RpO2PkeQ--\/dz0zMDAwO2g9MTY5Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0ae1e79c-ce4a-3de0-9ec9-2dcc085bad6d--1658211502.jpeg","height":1697,"width":3000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LTc6w.fjMqIm59RpO2PkeQ--\/dz0zMDAwO2g9MTY5Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0ae1e79c-ce4a-3de0-9ec9-2dcc085bad6d--1658211502.jpeg","imgw":3000,"imgh":1697,"title":"Terminal trailer, starring Margot Robbie and Simon Pegg","summary":"The last time that Margot Robbie produced and starred in a film - the first time, in point of fact - it resulted in the Oscar-nominated\u00a0I, Tonya. A delirious fourth-wall breaking anti-biopic biopic, the picture netted Robbie her first Academy Award nomination for playing infamous figure skater Tonya Harding and earned her co-star Allison Janney the actual Best Supporting Actress statue. As visible in the trailer's cryptic, Alice in Wonderland quoting tease, the basic conceit of this film is being kept close to the chest, but its talent and dreamscape visuals certainly catch our attention.

Beautifully paced and intelligently told, the resulting story is worth staying in on a Friday night for. Sarah Hughes Altered Carbon Netflix, from today\u00a0 \u201cThe first thing you\u2019ll learn is that nothing is as it seems,\u201d intones the solemn voice-over in this adaptation of Richard Morgan\u2019s excellent novel from 2002. Netflix\u2019s latest foray into hardcore science fiction follows a prisoner who, after 250 years in suspended animation, returns to life in a new body with one chance to win his freedom: solving a mind-bending murder. It\u2019s stylishly shot, and features a strong cast, including James Purefoy, Joel Kinnaman, and Hamilton star Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry.\u00a0 Anglo-Welsh Cup:\u00a0Northampton Saints v Harlequins BT Sport 1, 7.15pm Out-of-sorts Northampton, who\u2019ve won just one of their last eight Premiership games, face Harlequins in the Anglo-Welsh Cup at Franklin\u2019s Gardens. The last time these teams met, in December, Quins ran in seven tries, with Dave Ward, Danny Care and Tim Visser among the scorers, as Saints slumped to an embarrassing 50-21 defeat at Twickenham.\u00a0 Super League:\u00a0St Helens v Castleford Tigers\u00a0 Sky Sports Main Event, 7.30pm The Totally Wicked Stadium host the action as St Helens and Castleford Tigers get their seasons under way. These sides last met in the semi-finals of last year\u2019s competition in September, with the Tigers winning a dramatic match at the Mend-a-Hose Jungle 23-22 after extra-time, setting up a Grand Final meeting with Leeds Rhinos. Celebrity 5 Go Barging Channel 5, 8.00pm Last year, four celebrities gave us laughs as they took to the canals of England and Wales for the first run of this series. Now it returns with a new motley crew \u2013 Tom Conti, Diarmuid Gavin, Tessa Sanderson, Tony Christie and Penny Smith \u2013 and this time they are heading to France. So expect some crashes and fireworks. A Vicar\u2019s Life BBC Two, 8.30pm; not Wales The likeable series about vicars in Herefordshire continues with assistant curate Father Matthew Cashmore joining a relief effort taking aid to refugees in Calais, while his boss, the Reverend Ruth Hulse comes up with a novel way of boosting church attendance.\u00a0 Nigel Slater\u2019s Middle East BBC Two, 9.00pm; not Wales Nigel Slater is the sort of company you want on a food journey: enthusiastic, interesting and curious about the places he visits. This new series sees him heading throughout the Middle East, starting off in the food paradise of Beirut before moving on to the Beqaa Valley. Hits, Hype & Hustle: An Insider\u2019s Guide to the Music Business BBC Four, 9.00pm The music industry guide concludes with a focus on reunions, presented by PR man Alan Edwards. \u201cIt was supposed to be edge of the seat stuff but, in reality, it was end of the pier,\u201d he says, with a wicked grin, of the Sex Pistols reunion he engineered. Elsewhere, we\u2019re treated to footage of Debbie Harry performing with a giant pair of horns on her head. SH Celebrity Big Brother: Live Final Channel 5, from 9.00pm This series of the reality show, which is celebrating the year of the woman, apparently, reaches its finale. Sadly, the all-female house was short lived and the series has been reduced to the usual mix of crude comments and bed-hopping. SH King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 Sky Cinema Premiere, 8.00pm Guy Ritchie\u2019s combat-heavy Camelot is a very silly place. It sets up Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) as a Moses figure who\u2019s sent to Londinium when Vortigern (Jude Law) overthrows Camelot. What follows is a quick-witted caper, but the sword-pulling scene is sabotaged by a David Beckham cameo that saps the moment of its mythic excitement. Sorcerer (1977) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 10.45pm Given the wild success that William Friedkin had achieved with The French Connection (1971) and The Exorcist (1973), the catastrophic failure of Sorcerer, a thrillingly downbeat action film about truck drivers, counted as the bitterest blow of his career: he\u2019s always talked about it as his favourite film. Indeed, it\u2019s far too technically accomplished and conceptually bold to have deserved such short shrift. This Is 40 (2012) \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Channel 4, 12.10am Judd Apatow revisits two characters from his 2007 hit Knocked Up. Leslie Mann, Apatow\u2019s wife, and Paul Rudd play a stressed-out Los Angeles couple whose 40th birthdays bookend the film. Apatow and Mann\u2019s real-life daughters also play their children. It\u2019s a perceptive comedy on middle-age and one that guarantees big laughs alongside some of Apatow\u2019s most pertinent observations on love. Saturday 3 February\u00a0 Hard Sun: Agyness Deyn Hard Sun BBC One, 9.30pm Five weeks in, and the BBC\u2019s relentlessly dark, eye-wateringly violent thriller is not making much more sense than it did at the outset. All we really know is that those unlikely cops Hicks (Jim Sturgess) and Renko (Agyness Deyn) are still racing around London trying to outsmart MI5, using their belief that the world will end in a little under five years to justify doing indescribably horrible things to some indescribably horrible people.\u00a0 The bloody opening to this episode (suffice to say it involves an ice axe) follows on from last week\u2019s ending in which uber-spook Grace Morrigan (Nikki Amuka-Bird) helpfully gave Renko\u2019s psychopath son Daniel (Jojo Macari) details of who it was that raped his mother at the age 14, with predictable consequences. And guess who\u2019s given the job of investigating the case?\u00a0 That\u2019s the sort of circular plotting that gives Neil Cross\u2019s drama its pace, intensity and throbbing sense of paranoia. But the only thing that\u2019s truly mysterious here is how Hicks and Renko, with the security forces still breathing down their necks in pursuit of the flashdrive containing \u201cproof\u201d of the impending apocalypse, have any time left for the day job. Gerard O\u2019Donovan Hugh\u2019s Wild West BBC Two, 6.00pm;\u00a0 NI, 6.30pm; Wales, 5.30pm Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall heads for the Somerset Levels to witness a spectacular \u201cmurmuration\u201d of starlings. He also discovers how one native species of butterfly was rescued from the brink\u00a0 of extinction. \u00a0 The Voice UK ITV, 8.00pm The singing contest\u2019s second series on ITV continues to plod along, with singer Olly Murs making no great impact on the show, as yet. The blind auditions enter their fifth week with more contestants hoping that their performances will be enough to make the coaches spin their chairs. Casualty BBC One, 8.20pm Jeremy Hunt may not have predicted this year\u2019s winter NHS crisis, but the writers of Casualty did. Here, the emergency department is in gridlock, with trolleys blocking corridors and ambulances queuing outside to admit patients. It\u2019s just as well then that new junior doctor Bea Kinsella (Michelle Fox) is keen to get stuck in. Or is it? Grand Tours of Scotland\u2019s Lochs BBC Two, 8.30pm In an unexpectedly explosive edition, Paul Murton visits Loch Shin, where a meteor hit the Highlands 1.2 billion years ago. Then, at Kylesku, he recalls how Britain\u2019s \u201cX Men\u201d helped to destroy one of Germany\u2019s greatest battleships during the Second World War. \u00a0 Johnny Cash\u2019s\u00a0 Bitter Tears Sky Arts, 9.00pm This documentary celebrates one of the Man in Black\u2019s lesser-known works, his 1964 album Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian. It was a pioneering \u2013 and at the time controversial \u2013 album, which he used to draw attention to the long-running oppression of America\u2019s native peoples. The film also covers the making of a commemorative tribute album by Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, Kris Kristofferson and other country music stars. Spiral BBC Four, 9.00pm & 10.00pm The sixth series of this wonderfully gritty French policier, that\u2019s been fraught even by its own standards, comes to a nail-biting climax. As gangster Drissa Camara (Narcisse Mame-Zollo) is betrayed over a gold deal, Captain Laure (Caroline Proust) and her detective team get the break they need in the Mercier case and lawyer Jos\u00e9phine (Audrey Fleurot) realises that sticking to her story could place her in real jeopardy. Hamlet (1948, b\/w)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 London Live, 3.00pm This version of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet was adapted and directed by Laurence Olivier, who also starred as the troubled Prince of Denmark. Despite winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, purists felt that Olivier had taken liberties with the text, condensing four hours into two and removing the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. But the action remains tight and Olivier is magnificent. Suffragette (2015)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Channel 4, 9.00pm Never mind the respectable cast and period costumes \u2013 Sarah Gavron\u2019s fiery film about the fight for women\u2019s suffrage is far from genteel. Carey Mulligan is on form showing the transformation of Maud from bystander to activist with riveting emotional precision. As Abi Morgan\u2019s script strips away the reasons for her to fall back into line, her nerve soars through the roof. The Talented Mr Ripley (1999)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 BBC Two, 10.30pm Anthony Minghella\u2019s glossy take on Patricia Highsmith\u2019s novel is an engaging noir thriller with a pitch-perfect ending. New York wannabe Tom Ripley\u2019s life changes when he begins lusting after the lifestyle of an errant playboy (Jude Law) in Italy. Matt Damon is suitably sinister in the lead role, with Philip Seymour Hoffman equally as magnificent as a bulldozer who ruptures Tom\u2019s cosy idyll. Sunday 4 February Endeavour: Shaun Evans and Roger Allam Endeavour ITV, 8.00pm With the likes of Black Mirror, we live in an age of increasingly inventive television, but sometimes what we all need is a nice straightforward period procedural to relax in front of on a Sunday night. Russell Lewis\u2019s Endeavour, now returning for a fifth series, ticks all the boxes. There\u2019s a solid cast, anchored by Shaun Evans, as the young, less grumpy, more awkward Endeavour Morse; some nice if occasionally a little precise period detail (although I did like the throwaway reference to boxer Freddie Mills); and\u00a0 a plot that\u2019s just twisty enough to allow viewers to play \u201cguess the killer\u201d.\u00a0 This opening episode is a pretty bleak affair, centring around a missing Faberg\u00e9 egg and a series of seemingly unlinked deaths which (topically) turn out to have their origins in a riotous stag party. Along the way, Endeavour deals with an eager but unwanted new underling (Poldark\u2019s Lewis Peek) and crosses swords with a sharp-witted \u201cgood-time girl\u201d (Charlotte Hope), who delivers some home truths about his tendency to put women on pedestals. Meanwhile, the wonderful Roger Allam continues to steal every scene as Detective Chief Inspector Fred Thursday. Really someone should just give him his own show. Sarah Hughes Six Nations\u00a0Rugby Union: Italy v England\u00a0 ITV, 2.15pm Kicking off their defence of their title, England are at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where they face Italy. Eddie Jones\u2019s prospects for winning an unprecedented three championships in a row have been given a major boost: Jack Nowell, Chris Robshaw, Maro Itoje and Mike Brown, who were all doubts, have all been miraculously passed fit. Italy gave the champions a scare at Twickenham last term by taking a 10-5 half-time lead, but England eventually prevailed 36-15, with Nowell and Danny Care among the scorers.\u00a0 Premier League Football: Liverpool v\u00a0Tottenham Hotspur \u00a0 Sky Sports Main Event, 4.15pm Having bounced back from their defeat at Swansea with a 3-0 victory against Huddersfield \u2013 thanks to goals from Emre Can, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah \u2013 Liverpool host Spurs, who are one place beneath them in fifth. When these sides met in October, two goals from Harry Kane (who else?) helped Spurs to a comprehensive 4-1 victory.\u00a0 Call the Midwife BBC One, 8.00pm Prepare for a real weepy as Nurse Crane (Linda Bassett) and Trixie (Helen George) try to find out what secret a pregnant mother and her family are hiding. Elsewhere, Shelagh (Laura Main) worries that her new au pair isn\u2019t making friends.\u00a0 The Biggest Little Railway in the World Channel 4, 8.00pm The eccentric yet compelling journey comes to an end as Silver Lady heads towards Inverness. Will bad weather and issues with batteries bring this great experiment to a halt? Inside Number 10 BBC Parliament, 8.00pm We know all about the pressures of being Prime Minister but what\u00a0 about those real-life Sir Humphrey Applebys, the Cabinet Secretaries, aka the powers behind the throne? This interesting new series sees Sue Cameron interview all five living former Cabinet Secretaries about the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.\u00a0 \u00a0 McMafia BBC One, 9.00pm The action hots up considerably in this penultimate episode\u00a0 as Alex\u2019s (James Norton) lies unravel. But it\u2019s the Aleksei Serebryakov (as Alex\u2019s father Dimitri)\u00a0 who continues to steal the show. Meanwhile, there\u2019s an excellent vignette featuring nemesis Vadim (Merab Ninidze) chopping\u00a0 wood semi-clothed, presumably in homage\u00a0to Vladimir Putin. Maltese: The\u00a0Mafia Detective Channel 4, 10.00pm It might not be the\u00a0 most original series but this Italian import is among the most stylish. The setting is the Seventies and we open with a bang as maverick but honest cop Dario Maltese (Kim Rossi Stuart) finds himself dragged back to the corrupt Sicilian society he left years before.\u00a0 Arena: Stanley and his Daughters BBC Four, 10.00pm What is it really like to be the child of a genius? That question haunts\u00a0 the subjects of this fascinating film about the artist Stanley Spencer and his two daughters, Shirin and Unity. Now 91 and 87, Shirin and Unity were estranged for most of their lives after being separated as children.\u00a0\u201cI do feel that you were jealous of me for a time,\u201d says Unity while Shirin looks askance. What follows is a complex\u00a0 and complicated story\u00a0 of art, betrayal, love\u00a0 and loss which also allows us to view Spencer\u2019s work anew.\u00a0 American Football: Super Bowl LII Sky Sports Main Event, 11.00pm &\u00a0BBC One, 11.15pm Hot dogs and Buffalo\u00a0wings at the ready, as the New England Patriots, looking to win back-to-back Super Bowls, take on Philadelphia Eagles in Minneapolis at the US\u00a0Bank Stadium. The New England Patriots\u00a0overcame the Jackonsville Jaguars to set up a finale against the Eagles, who are playing in the showpiece for the first time since 2005, when they lost to the Pats. Much of the attention will be on the Patriots\u2019 40-year-old quarterback Tom Brady, who is attempting to become the first player to win six Super Bowl rings.\u00a0 \u00a0 Jane Eyre (1943, b\/w)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC Two, 2.10pm Deep focus and shadows give Robert Stevenson\u2019s version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s 1847 novel an extra tinge of Gothic atmosphere. Orson Welles, who provides his Mr Rochester with a hammy melancholy, is an omniscient presence but Joan Fontaine, who had a tendency to be outshone by more dynamic leading men (Cary Grant, Laurence Olivier), is formidable as Jane. Look out for Elizabeth Taylor as the ill-fated Helen Burns. Shark Tale (2004)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Channel 4, 4.40pm Some of Hollywood\u2019s most famous actors, including Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie (as well as director Martin Scorsese) provide the voices in this comedy animation about a mafia shark family and a little wrasse (Smith) who becomes a hero after surviving a shark encounter. It\u2019s not as good as Finding Nemo but much better than Ice Age. Plenty of gags for grown-ups, too. Yves Saint Laurent (2014)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC Two, 12.25am This window into the world of French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent tells a compelling if not especially potent story. It was made with the blessing of his partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9, and charts almost the entire trip, from Saint Laurent\u2019s upbringing in French Algeria to his rise to stardom at Christian Dior and the sexy, druggy, lucrative whirl that followed. Pierre Niney gives good doe-eyed fragility in the title role. Monday 5 February Moving On: Sue Johnston and Paula Wilcox star in Tuesday's episode Moving On BBC One, 2.15pm Jimmy McGovern\u2019s long-running anthology series, beginning its ninth run with another five stories spread across a week, is an exemplar of daytime drama, unafraid to tackle difficult issues and frequently promoting the work of novice writers or directors. That it occasionally settles said issues a little too neatly is understandable \u2013 no one wants gale-force McGovern over tea and biscuits \u2013 but they reliably make a virtue of the short running-time to deliver intensity and coiled emotion. Stories later in the week (at 2.15pm every afternoon and 2.45pm on Friday) include Sue Johnston\u2019s grieving widow seeking comfort in an unlikely place and Samantha Bond\u2019s registrar forced\u00a0 to re-evaluate her own marriage after an unwelcome discovery.\u00a0 The gripping opener, however, is written by and stars Jodhi May as Rachel, a woman wrestling with the news that the teacher who abused her as a child is back working in the area. Sinead Cusack supplies doughty support as Rachel\u2019s guilt-stricken mother, but May is hauntingly good as a woman torn between exposing her abuser\u00a0 and the potential impact that reopening old wounds may have on her marriage and children. Gabriel Tate My Life: Locked\u00a0 In Boy CBBC, 5.30pm This is a moving account of a 10-year-old whose cerebral palsy left him unable to communicate for eight years. Beginning with an alphabet board and his mother\u2019s help, Jonathan now has a reading age beyond his years, writes poetry and is petitioning MPs to improve education for children with his condition. \u00a0 Horizon: My Amazing Brain: Richard\u2019s War BBC Two, 9.00pm An extraordinary document of both personal fortitude and scientific endeavour, Fiona Lloyd-Davies\u2019s film follows the recovery of her husband, former UN peacekeeper Richard Gray, from a stroke. \u00a0 Next of Kin ITV, 9.00pm Danny (Viveik Kalra) tries to thwart the plans of the terror cell, Omar (Mawaan Rizwan) takes matters into his own hands and Guy (Jack Davenport) faces powerful enemies. Once again packing its excitements into the closing minutes after a lengthy, patient build-up, this decent thriller concludes tomorrow. \u00a0 The Bulger Killers: Was Justice Done? Channel 4, 9.00pm Rather than reliving the terrible event itself, Matt Smith\u2019s thoughtful film gathers together legal experts and those involved in the case to debate the sufficiency of the eight years served by John Venables and Robert Thompson for the murder of James Bulger in 1993. \u00a0 The X-Files Channel 5, 9.00pm After a patchy revival\u00a0 last year, The X Files rediscovers its mojo with an 11th series opener high on fun and intrigue. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) lies hospitalised after a seizure, so Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) goes in search of their son as war looms between humans and aliens. Hull\u2019s Headscarf Heroes BBC Four, 9.00pm Steve Humphries\u2019s documentary meets the redoubtable Yvonne Blenkinsop, leader of the \u201cheadscarf\u201d campaign against Hull\u2019s trawler companies whose questionable attitude towards crew safety cost 58 lives in a series of tragedies in 1968. \u00a0 Active Shooter: America Under Fire Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm In 2013, a gunman\u00a0 killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard. This documentary features an interview with the killer\u2019s sister, still wrestling with his descent into violence. Rear Window (1954)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Film4, 4.40pm Wonderful in its simplicity and compelling in its execution, this belongs in the first rank of Hitchcock\u2019s canon. The director presents a vignette of life through the lens of photographer L B \u201cJeff\u201d Jeffries (James Stewart), immobilised by a broken leg during a blistering heatwave. Events take an interesting turn when he suspects one of his neighbours across the courtyard may have murdered his wife. Lincoln (2012)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 9.00pm Daniel Day-Lewis is on marvellous, and Oscar-winning, form as Abraham Lincoln, in Steven Spielberg\u2019s intelligent, focused and robust film about the battle to abolish slavery. The film makes no attempt to cover the entire, unwieldy life of its subject. Instead, it dwells solely on the final months of Lincoln\u2019s presidency, during which the political and personal stakes were never higher. Tommy Lee Jones co-stars. The Silence of the Lambs (1991)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Channel 5, 10.00pm Anthony Hopkins triumphs in this creepy thriller as the psychotic Dr Hannibal Lecter who is recruited by trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to track down a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill. No matter how many times you watch this film, Hopkins\u2019s menacing performance \u2013 and his lip-smacking relish for human body parts \u2013 will always have you on the edge of your seat. Tuesday 6 February Flatpack Empire: James Futcher at SAPA aluminium factory Flatpack Empire BBC Two, 9.00pm There can\u2019t be many urbanites in the UK who haven\u2019t puzzled over the assembly instructions for a piece of Ikea furniture, let alone had the odd experience of being funnelled like a mouse in a maze through one of the firm\u2019s vast depot-like stores. For this series, the Swedish company has granted a camera crew \u201cworldwide access\u201d \u2013 from their design headquarters in Sweden to Indian furniture factories and Polish sawmills \u2013 to film the \u00a333 billion corporate Goliath\u2019s global operations over the course of a year. Perhaps the biggest surprise (and certainly the thing that Ikea wants us most to know about) is their current move \u2013 unthinkable previously \u2013 into collaborations with prestige independent designers and other brands, such as audio giants Sonos and fashion designer Virgil Abloh. Among the more interesting is a project with British furniture designer Tom Dixon.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not a sofa-bed, it\u2019s a bed-sofa, but it\u2019s really it\u2019s a platform for living,\u201d says Dixon, a mite grumpily, likening his role to that of a \u201cbenign parasite, where I can make a living out of this huge beast\u201d. Maybe they\u2019ll call the finished product \u201cthe bed bug\u201d instead of the Swedish names that us Brits struggle to pronounce. Gerard O\u2019Donovan Back in Time for Tea BBC Two, 8.00pm Sara Cox heads up this northern edition of the food-oriented time travel show. Tonight, the conditions that working class Yorkshire folk had\u00a0 to endure 100 years ago come as a shock for the Ellis family from Bradford, especially when one of them mistakes a mangle for a pasta maker. \u00a0 What Would Your\u00a0 Kid Do? ITV, 8.00pm Jason Manford puts parents\u2019 knowledge of their offspring to the test, as children are filmed performing tasks exploring creativity, risk-taking and rule breaking while Mum and Dad have to predict what happens next. Simple and dependably entertaining. Elizabeth: Our Queen Channel 5, 9.00pm Documentaries about the Royal family seem to be appearing at an ever-increasing rate. And now here\u2019s Channel 5\u2019s sprawling eight-part entry, covering her life and reign and hearing from former prime ministers, friends, royal household members and special advisors. Portrait Artist of the Year 2018 Sky Arts, 8.00pm This week\u2019s celebrity sitters are Game of Thrones star Conleth Hill, model Rachel Hunter and actor Stefanie Martini. But, as ever, it\u2019s not so much the well-known faces as the gentle competitiveness and warm interaction between the contestants that makes this portrait painting competition so very engaging. \u00a0 Art, Passion & Power: The Story of the Royal Collection BBC Four, 9.00pm In the final episode of\u00a0 his series on the breathtaking treasures of the Royal Collection, Andrew Graham-Dixon meets the Prince of Wales and explores the last 150 years \u2013 when, as he puts it, \u201cwomen took charge\u201d and used art to help steer the monarchy through times of turbulent change.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a period\u00a0 in which the Royal family\u2019s changing tastes, from Faberg\u00e9 eggs to the Queen Mother\u2019s more \u201cdaring\u201d art acquisitions, neatly demonstrate\u00a0 \u201cthe determined emergence of a modern monarchy\u201d. Inside No 9 BBC Two, 10.00pm;\u00a0 NI, 11.15pm The fourth series of Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton\u2019s darkly comic anthology has\u00a0 been a creepy delight.\u00a0 In Tempting Fate they\u2019ve kept one of the best for last, as a team of contractors clearing\u00a0 out a reclusive hoarder\u2019s council flat unleash a terrible curse. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 9.00pm Everything you\u2019d expect from Michael Bay is here with bells on \u2013 the macho provocation, the sound and fury, and the diabolical pleasure in reducing everything to rubble and bloody mush. However, as a gruelling epitaph to lives wasted, this true-life Libyan shoot-\u2019em-up starring John Krasinski is maddeningly effective and there\u2019s a strange purity to it. Slumdog Millionaire (2008)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 More4, 9.00pm Eight Oscars, seven Baftas and four Golden Globes cemented Danny Boyle\u2019s energetic adaptation of Vikas Swarup\u2019s novel Q & A as a triumph. The chaotic beauty of Mumbai is exuberantly brought to life to tell the story of an uneducated orphan (an endearing performance from Dev Patel) from the slums who is on the verge of winning a fortune on the Hindi version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. \u201971 (2014)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 11.50pm Jack O\u2019Connell excels in a near-wordless role as a naive squaddie who gets stranded on the streets of Belfast in 1971 and must throw himself on the mercy of loyalist allies, who are no certain guarantees of sanctuary. It\u2019s a tense, at times almost unbearable watch as we\u2019re wrong-footed all the time by the combinations of terror, guilt, manoeuvring, expediency and revenge that motivate even the most minor of characters. Wednesday 7 February My Millionaire Migrant Boss My Millionaire Migrant Boss Channel 4, 9.00pm Initially, this one-off documentary \u2013 following Pakistani multi-millionaire Marwan Koukash as he puts four unemployed Brits through their paces for two weeks, before deciding whether or not to give them a job at his swanky Liverpool hotel \u2013 seems like an odd attempt to make The Apprentice on the Dole. But park that knee-jerk criticism right there because what actually unfolds is a thoughtful film in which the tough-but-likeable Koukash refuses to either play to the camera or write off his four eager contenders. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s all plain sailing: bubbly Georgia\u2019s chronic unpunctuality soon causes issues, while Koukash, who grew up\u00a0 in a war zone, seems unsure of how to deal with 25-year-old Joe\u2019s lack of confidence. The most entertaining moments, however,\u00a0 come in the hotelier\u2019s relationship with the apparently lazy Heidi, who admits early on that she isn\u2019t really sure why she has to have a job before adding: \u201cI can\u2019t really find out what I want to do.\u201d A less interesting programme would have ensured that Heidi\u2019s role was to infuriate both Koukash and the viewers at home \u2013 instead what emerges is surprisingly touching. Sarah Hughes Stacey Dooley: Face to Face with ISIS BBC Three, from 10.00am This harrowing film follows Shireen, a Yazidi woman, as she returns to Iraq with reporter Stacey Dooley for a reckoning with her past. The pair face down soldiers and officials, many of whom seem intent on ensuring that those past atrocities are never mentioned. The final confrontation between Shireen and Anmar, an Islamic State commander, sees the latter squirm blankly as the former finally and movingly gives voice to her pain.\u00a0 Eurovision:\u00a0 You Decide BBC Two, 7.30pm Six lucky contestants battle it out for the dubious honour of becoming Britain\u2019s entrant to the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest. Among the hopefuls are\u00a0 a 16-year-old former Britain\u2019s Got Talent finalist, two former\u00a0 The Voice UK contestants\u00a0 and a Eurovision\u00a0 backing singer. \u00a0 Kirstie and Phil\u2019s Love It or List It Channel 4, 8.00pm The dynamic duo are in Windsor this week, where they meet the Farhall family who can\u2019t decide whether they should sell their four-bedroom detached home. A Stitch in Time BBC Four, 8.30pm This series about the history of fashion comes to an end with a look at the story behind Marie Antoinette\u2019s famously risqu\u00e9 portrait in her chemise. Butchart unpicks the meaning behind the painting, looking at what the unhappy French queen was trying to convey while also considering how and why her intended message backfired. It\u2019s a lovely conclusion to a hugely enjoyable series \u2013\u00a0 here\u2019s hoping for a swift return. The New Builds Are Coming: Battle in the Countryside BBC Two, 9.00pm; Scotland, 11.15pm Richard Macer\u2019s topical documentary concludes with the focus shifting towards those responsible for the Cullham new builds. \u201cNobody has a right to\u00a0 a view,\u201d states one architect. Maybe not,\u00a0but as Macer talks to all involved, so it becomes increasingly clear that this is not an issue that can be easily solved. \u00a0\u00a0 Girlfriends ITV, 9.00pm Kay Mellor\u2019s drama reaches its conclusion as Sue (Miranda Richardson) and Gail (Zo\u00eb Wanamaker) discover that Linda (Phyllis Logan) hasn\u2019t exactly been honest with them about her relationship with her late husband. Harvey (1950, b\/w)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Film4, 11.00am James Stewart stars as Elwood Dowd, a middle-aged, wide-eyed dreamer who spends his days getting tipsy with his best friend, a six-foot-three invisible white rabbit called Harvey. His sister Veta (an Oscar-winning Josephine Hull) tries to reform him and a comedy of errors ensues. Henry Koster\u2019s adaptation of Mary Chase\u2019s play is breezy, but has a lot to say about the importance of tolerance. Tango & Cash (1989)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ITV4, 9.00pm Bringing together two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest action heroes, this silly shoot-\u2019em-up is strangely appealing. Sylvester Stallone is Tango, a slick, sophisticated drug squad cop. Cash (Kurt Russell) is his uncultured rival on the force. And they don\u2019t get on. But when they are framed and sent to prison, they\u2019re forced to work together. It\u2019s pure Eighties bombast, with Yazoo and Alice Cooper on the soundtrack. Harmonium (2016)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Sky Cinema Premiere, 10.10pm Koji Fukada\u2019s subtle, slow-burning thriller tells of how a family\u2019s fragile domestic bliss is forever altered when an old friend comes to stay and teaches the daughter (Momone Shinokawa) to play the titular instrument. It\u2019s an elegant and gripping film, with a tragic twist halfway through, and rightly won the prize in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival. Thursday 8 February James Bulger: A Mother's Story James Bulger: a Mother\u2019s Story ITV, 9.00pm Opening with the sound of Jon Venables describing in a matter-of-fact manner how he and fellow 10-year-old Robert Thompson beat and stoned toddler James Bulger to death on a railway track, this documentary relives one of the most horrifying murders of the last century in often very difficult detail. Structured around an interview between Trevor McDonald and Bulger\u2019s mother,\u00a0 Denise Fergus, it exerts an awful grip while never quite deciphering the murder itself. Fergus recounts her unimaginable trauma, police and social workers describe their parts in the events and McDonald describes the trajectory of the case, from abduction to sentencing and an aftermath that has seen Fergus surround her house with CCTV cameras and Venables convicted of child pornography offences. The statements of the two killers \u2013 both, we are reminded, with troubled backgrounds \u2013 in particular are chilling: manipulative, jokey\u00a0 and fearful.\u00a0 The resilience and courage of Fergus, meanwhile, is admirable and unflinching some\u00a0 25 years on: \u201cThe day\u00a0 I stop speaking about James,\u201d she explains,\u00a0 \u201cis the day I join him.\u201d Gabriel Tate Death in Paradise BBC One, 9.00pm Another surreally absurd case for Jack Mooney (Ardal O\u2019Hanlon), as the leader of a spiritual retreat is strangled while his fellow members are deep in group meditation.\u00a0 \u00a0 Trouble at the Zoo BBC Two, 9.00pm The images and stories that came out of Cumbria\u2019s South Lakes Safari Zoo last year were deeply troubling, forcing management to step down in the face of evidence that almost 500 animals had died there\u00a0 in under four years.\u00a0 Jack Rampling\u2019s challenging observational documentary follows staff trying to keep the institution open in the face of widespread scepticism and queries whether zoos have a place in modern society. \u00a0 Dale Winton\u2019s Florida Fly Drive Channel 5, 9.00pm Scraping the barrel scarcely covers this new series in which the erstwhile Supermarket Sweep host traverses\u00a0 the Sunshine State to check out Walt Disney World, shopping centres and spiritualists. \u00a0 Derry Girls Channel 4, 10.00pm One of the big comedy hits of the year so far, Lisa McGee\u2019s evocative, ribald sitcom set\u00a0during the Troubles ends with Erin (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) getting her big break as editor\u00a0 of the school magazine. But with great power comes great and\u00a0 largely unwanted responsibility. Nazi Victory: the Postwar Plan UKTV Play, from today Starting (confusingly enough) on the Yesterday channel next week, this engaging new series explores what might have happened in the event of a Nazi victory in the Second World War, from the fifth columnists planted in the United States through to his plans for concentration camps and national monuments in Britain. The latter forms the basis of this opening episode. \u00a0\u00a0 Britannia Sky Atlantic, 9.00pm Jez Butterworth\u2019s compellingly berserk drama rampages through its fourth episode as Kerra (Kelly Reilly) is cast out by her father, King Pellenor,\u00a0 for parlaying with the Romans. How dare\u00a0 she betray the Cantii clan? He throws her\u00a0 to the mercy of the Druids \u2013 let\u2019s just hope that she doesn\u2019t meet\u00a0 the same fate as her mother. Meanwhile, former Druid Divis (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) suspects that there is more to General Aulus (David Morrissey) than meets the eye. Lucy (2014)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 9.00pm In this brilliant, bombastic sci-fi romp from Luc Besson, Scarlett Johansson (always worth watching) plays a drug mule who is dosed with an experimental substance that increases her brainpower by an untold degree. Space-time becomes a flick book, and Lucy\u2019s the girl to rifle through its pages. Besson described it as La Femme Nikita plus Inception plus 2001: A Space Odyssey: that\u2019s ambitious, egotistical, and mostly right. The Hurt Locker (2008)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 TCM, 9.00pm Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) won the Best Director Oscar (the first woman to do so) for her blistering drama about a bomb disposal unit leading a perilous existence in Iraq. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as a reckless maverick who delights in putting himself in harm\u2019s way, while the jittery cinematography stokes up the suspense to almost unbearable levels. Ralph Fiennes puts in a nice cameo as a military contractor. The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Film4, 10.45pm This startling debut by Marielle Heller shows the funny side of a teenager\u2019s explorations into her sexuality as a 15-year-old wannabe cartoonist Minnie (Bel Powley) seduces her mother\u2019s 35-year-old boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard). Heller\u2019s nimble direction and clever script ensure that the film never paints either Minnie or Monroe entirely as victim or predator. Friday 9 February Winter Olympics 2018: the BBC presenting team Live Winter Olympics 2018 Opening Ceremony BBC One, 10.30am These are interesting times on the Korean peninsula, which will no doubt bring an added frisson to the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea. More than 3,000 athletes from 90 countries are expected to march\u00a0 in the ceremony, which will feature a historic moment when the North and South Korean teams march together under a unified flag. History is also being made with the disqualification of Russia from the contest due to its state-sponsored doping scandal, although, controversially, 169 Russian athletes will\u00a0 still compete under a designated Olympic flag.\u00a0 The setting for the occasion is the 35,000- seater Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, and\u00a0 the following three hours of coverage comes from sure-footed BBC favourite Clare Balding, who\u2019ll also present highlights on BBC Two\u00a0 at 7.00pm on BBC Two. Team GB has set its sights on a record five medals, including perhaps its first in skiing. It\u2019s expected that North Korean artistes will perform at the ceremony in a spirit of cooperation, and while we can\u2019t expect anything as glorious as Danny Boyle\u2019s madcap mega-party for London 2012, we hope for a memorable kick-off to these historic Games. Vicki Power Jamie and Jimmy\u2019s Friday Night Feast Channel 4, 8.00pm Actor Josh Hartnett joins his co-hosts to whip up a beloved ramen dish as the cookery show concludes its fifth series. Jamie Oliver prepares a game curry before trotting off with pal Jimmy Doherty to investigate a new method of farming. Requiem BBC One, 9.00pm Creepy noises and unexplained presences continue to unsettle incomer Matilda (Lydia Wilson) in this thriller. Determined to find out if she\u2019s the child who disappeared from a Welsh backwater 24 years ago, Matilda begins to anger reluctant locals with her questions. Jamestown Sky One, 9.00pm A dramatic series of events in this episode provides an inkling of the high-stakes in store for season two of this glossy period piece based on the shipments of English brides to the American colonies in 1619. The opener sees Alice (Sophie Rundle) give birth and Jocelyn (Naomi Battrick) face tragedy.\u00a0 Will & Grace Channel 5, 10.00pm The sharp-as-ever sitcom veers into sentimentality with the death of Rosario, the maid that Karen (Megan Mullally) loved to torment. But it\u2019s nicely counterbalanced by Jack\u2019s (Sean Hayes) hilarious funeral speech and a punchy cameo\u00a0 from Minnie Driver. The Graham\u00a0 Norton Show BBC One, 10.35pm There are performers on a well-deserved victory lap feature here. Debra Messing and Eric McCormack soak up praise for the Will & Grace revival (see preview, left), actress Saoirse Ronan basks in the glow of her third Oscar nod, and Keala Settle performs the Oscar-nominated This Is Me from The Greatest Showman. \u00a0The Bold Type Amazon Prime,\u00a0 from today This fun comedy drama follows friends Jane (Katie Stevens), Kat (Aisha Dee) and Sutton (Meghann Fahy) working at a glossy magazine in New York. In the first episode, Jane is asked to write about her ex, while Kat attempts to convince an artist to be featured. Grand Prix Driver Amazon Prime,\u00a0 from today Michael Douglas narrates this behind-the-scenes look at McLaren\u2019s F1 team during their difficult 2017 season. The four half-hour episodes take us inside McLaren\u2019s mission control during troublesome test drives. Baywatch (2017)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 Sky Movies Premiere, 8.00pm Baywatch the TV show became a phenomenon, but everything about Baywatch the movie is big, brash and bombastic. Dwayne Johnson is preposterously buff in the role of chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon, while Zac Efron as new recruit Matt Brody is in full-on idiot mode. A cameo by David Hasselhoff, however, appearing to the strains of Jimi Jamison\u2019s theme I\u2019ll Be Ready, will raise a smile. Looper (2012)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 BBC Two, 11.05pm It\u2019s impossible not to be tickled by the playful logic of this sleek sci-fi film that ticks along with pocket-watch precision. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a \u201clooper\u201d \u2013 an assassin whose targets are zapped back to him from 30 years in the future, before his contract expires and his final target is his future self. It sounds confusing, but works, and has a great cast that includes Emily Blunt, Bruce Willis and Piper Perabo. The Cabin in the Woods (2012)\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 5STAR, 11.20pm Don\u2019t be fooled by its young cast (including a pre-Thor Chris Hemsworth) and stereotypical teenage-horror appeal: Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard\u2019s clever detonation of the scary movie is very good, with the genre\u2019s most original plot twist in years. The story, however, is a classic one: five friends visit a cabin in the woods, where they encounter more than they bargained for.

Jon Rahm nails Xander Schauffele's golf ball, sends it rocketing off green","summary":"It's rare, but there are times when crazy scenarios occur in golf and all is OK. Jon Rahm and Xander Schauffele got a glimpse of that Thursday. The star 20-somethings are paired together in the opening two rounds of this week's Waste Management Phoenix Open and proved their talents with rounds of 4-under 67 (Rahm) and 3-under 68 (Schauffele) to put themselves in the top 10 when they reached the clubhouse.

The film, directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Chadwick Boseman, thus offers a very different view of Africa than the one presented by President Trump when he reportedly referred to some African nations as \u201csh\u2014hole countries\u201d during a recent Oval Office immigration meeting. The cast and creators of Black Panther\u00a0have long expressed\u00a0the importance of representation onscreen, and at the world premiere Monday night in Hollywood, they discussed how the film itself serves as a rebuttal of Trump's purported remarks.

Adapted from Richard K. Morgan's celebrated 2002 book, Altered Carbon is second-generation future noir, and its riffing on Blade Runner is, if inferior to Blade Runner 2049, nonetheless handled stylishly.","published_at":1517210295,"content_id":"19bfdf15-e9c3-37d0-8c61-0ad67dff652b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/netflixs-new-sci-fi-blockbuster-series-altered-carbon-is-bootleg-blade-runner?source=articles_sum&via=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29","content_published_at":1517263215,"content_time":1517263215,"content_relative_time":93,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":93,"comment_relative_time":93,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-637f2da2-ada9-31a1-9c52-5763f0c23f4a_a-8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-637f2da2-ada9-31a1-9c52-5763f0c23f4a_a-8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-637f2da2-ada9-31a1-9c52-5763f0c23f4a_a-8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42","author":"third_watch","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/uk.businessinsider.com\/meghan-markle-will-make-a-speech-at-her-wedding-2018-1","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tLcPOdaXGbjIFcBkLCLg7w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ss2M3TtgJthweEKdQZGX3A--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTEyO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42-315076649.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xy0GsOO.XxxK_hQ4mVpcnA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MTI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ss2M3TtgJthweEKdQZGX3A--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTEyO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42-315076649.jpeg","height":512,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ss2M3TtgJthweEKdQZGX3A--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTEyO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8c0c477a-b5d5-3e79-859d-35825dcb0f42-315076649.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":512,"title":"Meghan Markle is defying another tradition and will make a speech at her wedding to Prince Harry","summary":"Meghan Markle has apparently said she will make a speech after her wedding to Price Harry.

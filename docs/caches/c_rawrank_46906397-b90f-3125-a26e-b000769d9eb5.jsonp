Not necessarily knowing how tall Sylvester Stallone was in real life, it was shocking to see Hogan tower above his co-star and toss him around the ring in Rocky III. It spawned research to learn that Hulk Hogan was, in real life, a man that stood 6-foot-7 and weighed over 300 pounds, a behemoth by any standard. No sooner was that discovery made, though, than one would inevitably see Hulk Hogan standing next to a man who made him look as small as Thunderlips made Rocky look. Back then, it was easy to enjoy and be amazed by Andre the Giant, but it was impossible to process how he could be real.","published_at":1523316740,"content_id":"660fa844-c179-32f6-af1e-d33940ed2d2a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/review\/andre-giant-review-1100653","content_published_at":1523305137,"content_time":1523305137,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":21,"comment_relative_time":21,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d2a8ab13-71cd-336b-9507-49e427508fa5","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-12e3e657-b640-38de-a7fd-fa6e118b6d6d_a-d2a8ab13-71cd-336b-9507-49e427508fa5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-12e3e657-b640-38de-a7fd-fa6e118b6d6d_a-d2a8ab13-71cd-336b-9507-49e427508fa5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/lucasfilm-digital-scans-lead-star-qai0e93","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Screen Rant","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/star-wars-digital-actors-scans-carrie-fisher\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Lucasfilm Has Digital Scans of All Lead Star Wars Actors","summary":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi VFX supervisor Ben Morris reveals it's standard procedure at the studio to digitally scan the lead actors of the films to have on file. The galaxy far, far away has always been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of filmmaking technology, but it wasn't too long ago Lucasfilm generated some controversy due to their innovative advancements. As many know by now, 2016's\u00a0Rogue One featured a CGI recreation of the late Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, and the final scene starred a digitally de-aged Carrie Fisher as the 19-year old Princess Leia from\u00a0A New Hope.

Marvel Set Photos Reveal New Look At Mystery Character","summary":"As filming for\u00a0Captain Marvel, the MCU's first female-led movie, continues in Los Angeles, the latest batch of photos from the set reveal a new look at Lashana Lynch in character as, well, we're not sure yet as details of who she's playing have been kept under wraps so far. As you can see from the images below, though, it looks like she may be a friend of Brie Larson's Carol Danvers, given that she's wearing an outfit that's similar to the one that Larson's rocking. If you'll recall, Lynch was a late-in-the-day replacement for DeWanda Wise, who had to drop out of\u00a0Captain Marvel\u00a0due to scheduling conflicts with her TV show\u00a0She's Gotta Have It. Rumours previously stated that Wise was playing Monica Rambeau, who's one of the other\u00a0heroes who's gone by the name Captain Marvel in the comics.","published_at":1523297898,"content_id":"32a6872f-0b52-371b-95f3-acc63c86a581","content_url":"http:\/\/wegotthiscovered.com\/movies\/captain-marvel-set-photos-lasana-lynch\/","content_published_at":1523279212,"content_time":1523279212,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0877424a-694a-3f87-ad7a-3c0911a488e6","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-008ec8fd-24b9-395d-bf41-c3cb8e84182b_a-0877424a-694a-3f87-ad7a-3c0911a488e6","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-008ec8fd-24b9-395d-bf41-c3cb8e84182b_a-0877424a-694a-3f87-ad7a-3c0911a488e6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/why-disney-t-spider-man-zvx69kk","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Fortune","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/why-disney-t-spider-man-151533020.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za09GSNwtE6hhzKsZk_Ajg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fortune_175\/2b65c3dbe71ec290f5479e7de3aed43e","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/g_44MsgEqLxwhVVIIoS60w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fortune_175\/2b65c3dbe71ec290f5479e7de3aed43e","height":683,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fortune_175\/2b65c3dbe71ec290f5479e7de3aed43e","imgw":1024,"imgh":683,"title":"Why Disney Can\u2019t Use Spider-Man or the Avengers at Its Orlando Location\u2014Even Though It Owns the Marvel Brand","summary":"California Adventure has an Avengers expansion on the way, but don't expect one in Orlando.","published_at":1523297898,"content_id":"0877424a-694a-3f87-ad7a-3c0911a488e6","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/why-disney-t-spider-man-151533020.html","content_published_at":1523286933,"content_time":1523286933,"content_relative_time":26,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":26,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d42cde1e-2edd-375e-b8b4-98607a03aef9","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-7fc9f681-ac7d-3e11-966d-cec8d9f70491_a-d42cde1e-2edd-375e-b8b4-98607a03aef9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-7fc9f681-ac7d-3e11-966d-cec8d9f70491_a-d42cde1e-2edd-375e-b8b4-98607a03aef9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/star-wars-15-weird-facts-26w81hv","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Screen Rant","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/star-wars-facts-darth-vader-helmet\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Star Wars: 15 Weird Facts About Darth Vader's Helmet","summary":"Darth Vader is easily one of the most well-known villains in history.

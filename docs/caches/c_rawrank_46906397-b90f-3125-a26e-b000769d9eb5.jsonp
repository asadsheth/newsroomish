Vaughan and Adrian Alphona-created comic book series about six teenagers who discover that their parents are part of an evil crime organization called The Pride -- and that they themselves have inherited their parents' powers and abilities. While Runaways ended up going in a different direction -- as a Hulu TV series that ended its first season this past January -- the film version was in development for several years. At one point, Drew Pearce, creator of the British TV series No Heroics (a superhero spoof), was tapped in 2010 to write a screenplay for the movie, a job that ended up being his first professional sale in Hollywood. Den of Geek spoke with Pearce at the press junket for Hotel Artemis, a new dystopian noir thriller which he wrote and made his feature directorial debut on, and asked him for his thoughts on that script and how it might have fit into what became the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","published_at":1526902738,"content_id":"d7d103cf-a00e-3894-8efc-d934676f95fd","content_url":"http:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\/us\/movies\/runaways\/273638\/the-runaways-movie-you-never-saw","content_published_at":1526886000,"content_time":1526886000,"content_relative_time":9,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":9,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e4b954ce-9cf3-3600-9f09-f664dde92379","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-21da48e9-1126-3f3c-8842-061d8ea132a5_a-e4b954ce-9cf3-3600-9f09-f664dde92379","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-21da48e9-1126-3f3c-8842-061d8ea132a5_a-e4b954ce-9cf3-3600-9f09-f664dde92379","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/italy-vivo-film-produce-abel-3f94o20","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Variety","provider_url":"http:\/\/variety.com","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-01-04\/9424f7a0-b2ba-11e5-9973-4bedbed702ba_0fc26244a3776a6703fec753a6b2c61c.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/italy-vivo-film-produce-abel-092229414.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ucW4j_vV91Pmw9Z.x31Hhw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/variety.com\/ead288af6b3bc7a82fc0e67788a4cd55","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8RhBAWzP7RpkCb56SgrKPQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDA5O3c9MzUwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/variety.com\/ead288af6b3bc7a82fc0e67788a4cd55","height":2409,"width":3500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/variety.com\/ead288af6b3bc7a82fc0e67788a4cd55","imgw":3500,"imgh":2409,"title":"Italy\u2019s Vivo Film to Produce Abel Ferrara\u2019s \u2018Siberia\u2019, Other New Films (EXCLUSIVE)","summary":"Vivo Film, Italian indie known for recent standout titles such as \u201cNico, 1988\u201d and \u201cDaughter of Mine,\u201d has boarded Abel Ferrara\u2019s long-gestating \u201cSiberia\u201d as its main producer.

The provision eliminates the interest deduction on such loans, a move that could cost a borrower several hundred dollars a year, depending on the loan amount. Currently, borrowers can write off the interest on home equity loans of up to $100,000. It's one of several provisions in the bill that would reduce the financial perks homeowners have long enjoyed through their tax returns, a swing away from a policy that for decades has been aimed at encouraging homeownership.","published_at":1513681487,"content_id":"fc62bcf8-aace-3ce6-94ae-46db8c3d4088","content_url":"http:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/business\/2017\/12\/18\/bad-news-homeowners-tax-bill-would-eliminate-write-off-home-equity-loans\/LNnFLJg4cGpIowr435iKdI\/story.html","content_published_at":1513660680,"content_time":1513660680,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":13,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"68ed8914-dcfc-3001-ae95-d0b040d3daf9","post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-ef7f7f0a-6a1c-3a5d-952c-409ed7e0af5f_a-68ed8914-dcfc-3001-ae95-d0b040d3daf9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-ef7f7f0a-6a1c-3a5d-952c-409ed7e0af5f_a-68ed8914-dcfc-3001-ae95-d0b040d3daf9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/intel-amd-micron-much-2018-4zwgxrc","author":"nanook","provider":"Barrons.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/intel-amd-micron-much-to-like-in-2018-despite-slowing-market-growth-says-wells-1513626932?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Intel, AMD, Micron: Much to Like in 2018, Despite Slowing Market Growth, Says Wells","summary":"The chip industry is threatened by slowing growth, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t buy into stocks of top companies such as Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU) and Advanced\u00a0Micro Devices\u00a0(AMD), according to a report this morning from David Wong of Wells Fargo.

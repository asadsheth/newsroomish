These were not patches of snow and ice, but rather plumes of smoke from the island's biggest wildfire\u00a0on record, burning through miles of thawed peatland. Black carbon particles from smoke plumes can darken Greenland's vast ice sheet, contributing to more heat absorption and more melting. Scientists who studied the wildfire said that nearly a third of the soot landed on Greenland's ice sheet. They warned that much bigger blazes could move through the icy island in the future, and the emissions from these fires could contribute to further melting of the already thinning ice sheet. \"I think it's a warning sign","published_at":1523619270,"content_id":"6fbe9b23-e1bf-38a4-8e9b-9080654f4a0e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/62297-greenland-biggest-wildfire-warning-sign.html","content_published_at":1523617800,"content_time":1523617800,"content_relative_time":104,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-b6392085-3155-3041-97e7-202390cc3e09_a-1b9e9613-3dda-3a70-96b6-dd366d182c01","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/ok-town-threatened-wildfire-evacuated-2l3i2kg","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"wsfa.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.wsfa.com\/story\/37949102\/ok-town-threatened-by-wildfire-evacuated","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4iyl8zqsQUGBmqcVbpj8fQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kzig3JUsdk5fkNPfaIL3Gg--\/dz04NDY7aD00NzI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1b9e9613-3dda-3a70-96b6-dd366d182c01-1977977146.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/upoZIX1ASPtDH0kw2q4w8g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NzI7dz04NDY7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kzig3JUsdk5fkNPfaIL3Gg--\/dz04NDY7aD00NzI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1b9e9613-3dda-3a70-96b6-dd366d182c01-1977977146.jpeg","height":472,"width":846,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kzig3JUsdk5fkNPfaIL3Gg--\/dz04NDY7aD00NzI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1b9e9613-3dda-3a70-96b6-dd366d182c01-1977977146.jpeg","imgw":846,"imgh":472,"title":"OK town threatened by wildfire evacuated","summary":"VICI, OKLAHOMA (CNN) - The entire town of Vici\u00a0- with a 2014 population of 715 - has been evacuated because of a wildfire.\u00a0 Officials rescued two hunters trapped by the blaze in Dewey County, but a 54-year-old man is still missing.\u00a0 About 800 homes are threatened in this northwest Oklahoma town, and at least three have been destroyed so far.\u00a0 Police said they believe the fire has caused more damage in areas they can't access.\u00a0 Strong winds are fanning the flames.

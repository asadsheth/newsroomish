The BLM, a division within Interior, later estimated the early detection of the fire by the drone saved $50 million in land and infrastructure value that could have otherwise been lost. \"I think that is a pretty compelling example of how drones work,\" Mark Bathrick, director of Interior's Office of Aviation Services, said in an interview.","published_at":1520792166,"content_id":"8be6bf5d-648a-32dc-9e87-ffdca0c79a8a","content_url":"http:\/\/www.oregonlive.com\/wildfires\/index.ssf\/2018\/03\/the_next_wildfire_season_start.html","content_published_at":1520744400,"content_time":1520744400,"content_relative_time":66,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-d1180356-a5c0-33fe-ae52-dc63323a5667_a-54ac8f95-c9c3-3637-81e4-958b92624e58","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/residents-forestry-officials-clash-over-57764r5","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"San Francisco Chronicle","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/news\/article\/Residents-forestry-officials-clash-over-Sunriver-12742943.php","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EVoKPhLf5UNcaIJTeNN_WQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KjWMMDJ2FjmagRo77Oneew--\/dz01MDA7aD0yNjE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_19f76f3a-8ccc-3a54-9696-c1180de301e1--1830893255.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CA5FmNwK7cMJseUmngKH_g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNjE7dz01MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KjWMMDJ2FjmagRo77Oneew--\/dz01MDA7aD0yNjE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_19f76f3a-8ccc-3a54-9696-c1180de301e1--1830893255.jpeg","height":261,"width":500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KjWMMDJ2FjmagRo77Oneew--\/dz01MDA7aD0yNjE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_19f76f3a-8ccc-3a54-9696-c1180de301e1--1830893255.jpeg","imgw":500,"imgh":261,"title":"Residents, forestry officials clash over Sunriver wildfire","summary":"BEND, Ore.

(AP) \u2014 A teenager charged in juvenile court with starting an explosive wildfire in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge last fall by tossing a lit firecracker into the woods pleaded guilty Friday in a deal that spares him time in custody. The boy, who was 15 at the time, has not been identified by authorities because of fear for his safety after an angry backlash from those who consider the scenic gorge a cherished playground on Portland's doorstep. He appeared in Hood River County Court with his parents, who followed the hearing with the help of an interpreter. The teen's family emigrated to the U.S. in 2000 from Ukraine and lives in Vancouver, Washington.

From the devastating blazes that reduced more than a million acres of California to ashes late last year to the ferocious flames that tragically killed 66 people in Portugal, 2017 was a record year for wildfires. Across southern Europe, lives were lost and homes destroyed as dry, hot weather and strong winds led to a doubling of the usual number of forest fires; meanwhile, in the US the forest service spent a record $2bn tackling the problem. Furthermore, while 2017 was a dramatic year, experts fear we could see more of the same in the years ahead as a combustible combination of climate-change induced extreme weather and increasing levels of human activity in fire-risk areas fuels longer and more severe fire seasons.","published_at":1518617010,"content_id":"83171e47-71fd-35ec-a33f-6826e0d220e8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theengineer.co.uk\/aerial-firefighting-technology\/","content_published_at":1518597022,"content_time":1518597022,"content_relative_time":663,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-aed5dda4-d8d3-3ae9-90bd-933721645164_a-79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/couple-still-rebuilding-fort-mcmurray-1nxkzl5","author":"nanook","provider":"globalnews.ca","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/4022197\/couple-who-are-still-rebuilding-after-fort-mcmurray-wildfire-wins-1m-lottery-prize\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j1UJD7YsWsavdPbcv.BO4A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4zmWzyHd.kKIPTBl0V2ucg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716--1915603790.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LLjx0x_aR0iCdOtMEXSlIQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00ODA7dz03MjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4zmWzyHd.kKIPTBl0V2ucg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716--1915603790.jpeg","height":480,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4zmWzyHd.kKIPTBl0V2ucg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716--1915603790.jpeg","imgw":720,"imgh":480,"title":"Couple who are still rebuilding after Fort McMurray wildfire wins $1M lottery prize","summary":"A Fort McMurray man, who bought a winning Lotto 649 ticket while visiting his ailing father in Newfoundland, says he and his wife plan to use their $1 million prize to finish rebuilding their home after the 2016 wildfire.

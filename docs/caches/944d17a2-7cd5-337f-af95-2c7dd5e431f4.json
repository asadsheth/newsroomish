Fire department spokeswoman Amy Bastman says the first blaze broke out Sunday afternoon in Elysian Park and was knocked down in about 15 minutes. A short time later, three more fires were reported in the area and all were doused within about an hour. No injuries were reported and no structures were threatened. Bastman says the largest fire burned on an embankment near Solano Avenue Elementary School. She says the similar locations of the fires and the brief time frame makes them suspicious.","published_at":1529332331,"content_id":"f32b45fc-11d9-3c60-8991-f09dd488ecb5","content_url":"http:\/\/www.cbs8.com\/story\/38447488\/series-of-los-angeles-brush-fires-investigated-as-arson","content_published_at":1529332380,"content_time":1529332380,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-6a3538d0-bbfd-3256-a4bf-b6fe8a5c0a0a_a-841c3012-0531-382b-8a8e-b5fb42c1e667","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/equine-microchips-help-unite-horses-68g5mrg","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"KDVR

In the wake of the most destructive fire season in California history, peaking with the fast-burning Wine Country blazes that killed 41 people and wiped out nearly 9,000 homes and other buildings, pressure to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire has been immense.

The divisions inside her government over the customs issue were laid bare on Tuesday when Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said proposals for a customs partnership with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc were \"crazy\". May's decision to leave the EU's customs union, which sets tariffs for goods imported into the bloc, has become one of the main flashpoints in the Brexit debate, pitting companies and pro-EU campaigners against eurosceptics in parliament.","published_at":1526298037,"content_id":"c5ca7510-e402-31f5-8cfb-48093de2d384","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trust-brexit-uk-pm-may-says-ministers-squabble-123854489.html","content_published_at":1526223451,"content_time":1526223451,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

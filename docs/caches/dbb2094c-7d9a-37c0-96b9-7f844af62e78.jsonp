The disclosure, signed by Trump and released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, did not describe the purpose or the recipient of the original 2016 payment to a \"third party\" made by Cohen, for which he was reimbursed by Trump. Rudy Giuliani, who recently became the Republican president's new personal attorney, has said Trump reimbursed Cohen for the original, $130,000 payment, which was made shortly before Trump's victory in the Nov. 8, 2016 presidential election.","published_at":1526493881,"content_id":"e55c8e3b-0fb8-322f-b739-082dd5b66586","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-repaid-attorney-cohen-2016-payment-made-behalf-174124189.html","content_published_at":1526500457,"content_time":1526500457,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Politics","vibe_id":"dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-84d1c3cd-bf92-351b-bc58-bcc38199669c_a-1995c0ad-bbf8-3e84-a2cb-97303e5f4d42","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-84d1c3cd-bf92-351b-bc58-bcc38199669c_a-1995c0ad-bbf8-3e84-a2cb-97303e5f4d42","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Reuters","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-02-01\/973af590-e89a-11e6-b294-9bc8096ac008_reuters.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/house-speaker-ryan-moves-stop-republican-revolt-immigration-150750015.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yZRH4MILvTcTMwrMaoL74g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-16T171218Z_1_LYNXNPEE4F1GU_RTROPTP_2_USA-IMMIGRATION-CONGRESS.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/R3cshePgHzjQqhRO6imB4A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-16T171218Z_1_LYNXNPEE4F1GU_RTROPTP_2_USA-IMMIGRATION-CONGRESS.JPG","height":300,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-16T171218Z_1_LYNXNPEE4F1GU_RTROPTP_2_USA-IMMIGRATION-CONGRESS.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":300,"title":"House Speaker Ryan seeks to head off Republican revolt on immigration","summary":"By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan sought to head off revolts on Wednesday from the right and center of his Republican Party as lawmakers battled over legislation that would protect young illegal immigrants from deportation. At a morning news conference after huddling privately with rank-and-file Republicans, Ryan warned a small group of moderates that it would be a \"big mistake\" if they kept pushing a procedural maneuver to force a series of votes on four separate immigration bills. Some Republicans worried such a debate could lead to a bipartisan immigration bill passing that might anger conservative Republicans at an inopportune time, with November elections approaching.","published_at":1526490044,"content_id":"1995c0ad-bbf8-3e84-a2cb-97303e5f4d42","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/house-speaker-ryan-moves-stop-republican-revolt-immigration-150750015.html","content_published_at":1526503865,"content_time":1526503865,"content_relative_time":1,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Politics","vibe_id":"dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

The success of the Cubs and Astros, who both went through 100-loss seasons on their way to a World Series title, has been used by many to justify the practice. As Dave Sheinin writes in this piece, tanking is not limited to just baseball. Sheinin also provides a good definition of tanking when he writes that it is \u201cthe systematic writing-off of entire seasons by franchises hoping to rebuild for future success through the draft,\u201d although in MLB, more than in other sports, that system also includes the acquisition of cheap minor league ballplayers.","published_at":1520865868,"content_id":"f07c596e-5c4a-373b-9afb-396297ca2d5e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bleedcubbieblue.com\/2018\/3\/12\/17104896\/tanking-mlb-mike-moustakas-free-agency-tank-tax","content_published_at":1520830800,"content_time":1520830800,"content_relative_time":37,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":37,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"e36d905a-5bda-317f-a213-dafe5919e89a","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-81b97d2a-a5ab-3e93-96e1-b8dd6d761b9c_a-e36d905a-5bda-317f-a213-dafe5919e89a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-81b97d2a-a5ab-3e93-96e1-b8dd6d761b9c_a-e36d905a-5bda-317f-a213-dafe5919e89a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/twitter-goes-goal-deal-major-5r1m2cy","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Digital Trends","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/twitter-major-league-soccer-deal\/?src=rss","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZOEzCyvY0QkH_2MBISMxWw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LVK2aveJ10UDbHwzaxB5wA--\/dz03MjA7aD0zNzY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e36d905a-5bda-317f-a213-dafe5919e89a-1495730469.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0bhucAKFOkDiC2jUjJSUIg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzY7dz03MjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LVK2aveJ10UDbHwzaxB5wA--\/dz03MjA7aD0zNzY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e36d905a-5bda-317f-a213-dafe5919e89a-1495730469.jpeg","height":376,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LVK2aveJ10UDbHwzaxB5wA--\/dz03MjA7aD0zNzY7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e36d905a-5bda-317f-a213-dafe5919e89a-1495730469.jpeg","imgw":720,"imgh":376,"title":"Twitter goes for goal with new deal for Major League Soccer games","summary":"The social media giants are continuing with efforts to bring live sports action to their users, with both Twitter and Facebook announcing deals in recent days.

Facebook said Friday that recorded broadcasts also will be available globally, excluding select international markets. The package, MLB's first digital-only national broadcast agreement, precludes teams from televising those games on their regional sports networks.

With the addition of pitcher Gerrit\u00a0Cole and a full season with former Cy Young winner Justin Verlander, it's not surprising the defending champion Houston Astros are the team to beat in 2018 and No. 1 in USA TODAY Sports' first installment of power rankings. Nine of the top 10 teams\u00a0were playoff clubs in 2017. The Milwaukee Brewers, No. 7, aim to disrupt the field with the addition\u00a0of outfielders Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain.\u00a0 The Miami Marlins, who dumped their entire outfield, including NL MVP Giancarlo Stanton,\u00a0\u00a0finished at the bottom of the rankings.\u00a0 From 1","published_at":1520347996,"content_id":"fb7e4b19-f254-32f6-bb6f-f88e1c756119","content_url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/mlb\/2018\/03\/06\/mlb-power-rankings-preseason-astros\/396349002\/","content_published_at":1520347562,"content_time":1520347562,"content_relative_time":171,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":171,"comment_relative_time":171,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"67b198f1-9ea2-3988-8e84-f76542eee9d1","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-c777daee-9f07-3242-9922-dbce4df98826_a-67b198f1-9ea2-3988-8e84-f76542eee9d1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-c777daee-9f07-3242-9922-dbce4df98826_a-67b198f1-9ea2-3988-8e84-f76542eee9d1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/teams-next-winters-big-spenders-3d1bfik","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ESPN.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/mlb\/insider\/story\/_\/id\/22658229\/mlb-which-teams-next-winter-big-spenders","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4deaSfh7f3_jICtZBdwJog--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IynL6dw3Uu5cJWV1xH7JyQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_67b198f1-9ea2-3988-8e84-f76542eee9d1-2013558682.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WVw4zlOSe175VdW.qeIT4Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Mjk7dz0xMjk2Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IynL6dw3Uu5cJWV1xH7JyQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_67b198f1-9ea2-3988-8e84-f76542eee9d1-2013558682.jpeg","height":729,"width":1296,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IynL6dw3Uu5cJWV1xH7JyQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_67b198f1-9ea2-3988-8e84-f76542eee9d1-2013558682.jpeg","imgw":1296,"imgh":729,"title":"Which teams should be next winter's big spenders?","summary":"When it comes to the bottom-line total of wins and losses, rebuilding can be a difficult time for fans, even with the knowledge that it's part of a long-term plan for future success.

Jake Arrieta Fell from Cy Young Winner to Scaring Away MLB Teams","summary":"Jake Arrieta doesn't have a job in early March. That's an absurd statement. Arrieta won the National League Cy Young Award in 2015 and was an All-Star in 2016. His results took a dive last season, as we'll discuss, but his right arm didn't fall off. He's a high-upside pitcher with the potential to front a starting rotation. What happened? How did Arrieta plummet from award-winning grace to March unemployment? The most obvious culprit is his agent, Scott Boras. Boras has built a legend by landing his clients gaudy paydays. In November, he called Arrieta \"a big squirrel with lots of nuts in his trees,\" per Bob Nightengale of USA Today.

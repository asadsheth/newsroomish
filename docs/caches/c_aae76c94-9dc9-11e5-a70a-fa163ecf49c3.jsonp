The rookie right-hander thought it had healed enough for him to pitch effectively when he took the mound again Tuesday night in front of a sellout crowd eager to see Ohtani's next incredible feat. Instead, the blister and the powerful Boston Red Sox were far too much to overcome. Mookie Betts led off with the first of his three homers, and the Red Sox chased Ohtani after just two innings in a 10-1 victory over the Angels. Ohtani (2-1) yielded four hits and three runs on 66 pitches before exiting with a blister on his pitching hand.

North Korea has been attempting to shift to nuclear energy since the 1960s but progress has been hampered by a lack of funding and international sanctions designed to inhibit the regime\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.\u00a0 The Soviet Union helped to construct the first 2-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon in 1965, while North Korean scientists have since probably developed the skills and equipment required to build a facility similar to a Soviet-era RBMK-1000 light water graphite reactor - the same type that was in use at Chernobyl.\u00a0 And while a relatively simple design, the political pressure to \u201ccrank up more power to generate electricity inevitably leads to an increased risk of disasters associated with human errors as well as imperfect operation and protection systems\u201d, Mr Shcheka wrote in the study, published on the 38 North website operated by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\u00a0 \u201cThe concern is that the North Koreans may attempt to launch nuclear power plants with substandard and poorly tested reactors\u201d, he said. \u201cDoing so would keep with the North Korean tradition of sacrificing safety standards to accelerate construction of high-priority industrial facilities.\u00a0 \u201cSoviet technical specialists who assisted the DPRK in the 1960s repeatedly noted North Koreans\u2019 willingness to cut corners in terms of safety standards for the sake of construction speed\u201d. Operating even marginally beyond the capacity of these reactors \u201ccan cause rapid irreversible consequences\u201d that lead to soaring internal pressures that would destroy the plant.\u00a0 \u201cBased on the reactor\u2019s power generating capability, and depending on weather conditions, such as strength and direction of the wind, up to 100 million people in North and South Korea, the eastern provinces of China, in the south of Russia\u2019s Far East and on the west coast of Japan could be exposed to mortal danger\u201d, Mr Shcheka said. North Korea\u2019s nuclear progress - estimated yields per test The study makes no mention of an impact on the United Kingdom, although trace amounts of radiation were detected in Britain in the aftermath of the meltdown of three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant in north-east Japan in March 2011.\u00a0 Mr Shcheka points out that work on the 100 megawatt reactor at Yongbyon was started in 2010 and is still in the experimental phase, although it is likely that North Korea has undeclared nuclear facilities for research and its weapons programme that may have similarly low levels of safety standards.\u00a0","published_at":1524197424,"content_id":"b8071bea-391e-36a1-96eb-727d9477a394","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-nuclear-reactor-puts-040732543.html","content_published_at":1524197252,"content_time":1524197252,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean

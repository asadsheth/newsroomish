Trump, who is currently at his Florida resort meeting with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, said Tuesday that the U.S. and North Korea were holding direct talks at \u201cextremely high levels\u201d in preparation for a possible summit with Kim.","published_at":1524017444,"content_id":"6ebdb3e4-35fe-34b2-bc41-ef0e8a5e7fd0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/?p=10797420","content_published_at":1524004986,"content_time":1524004986,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3f1df74-78df-3143-94e0-db49ccccc38d_a-4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3f1df74-78df-3143-94e0-db49ccccc38d_a-4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Fox News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2018\/04\/17\/us-japan-summit-underway-with-trump-and-abe-showcases-special-relationship.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/84qBPbYy.VnXuV3yP0jCfg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c3BYVwVQXLQQpnkYH.e_Xw--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0-197471753.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Kcgmuwmj0biqP2jDrZj07w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c3BYVwVQXLQQpnkYH.e_Xw--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0-197471753.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c3BYVwVQXLQQpnkYH.e_Xw--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0-197471753.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"US-Japan summit underway with Trump and Abe showcases 'special relationship'","summary":"The U.S.-British alliance \u2013 a bond forged in blood in two world wars, is the so-called \u201cspecial relationship\u201d most people fawn over.

Experts from the government's chemical defence laboratory at Porton Down, just six miles from where Sergei Skripal was targeted in Salisbury, were understood to be urgently trying to identify the chemical. The former Russian spy and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia, who was with him at the time, were rushed to Salisbury District Hospital, where a major incident was declared, amid fears the mysterious substance could result in further casualties. One theory being explored was that the substance could be the deadly nerve agent, VX, which was used last year in the murder of Kim Jong-nam\u00a0- the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The chemical was first developed by the British firm, ICI, in the 1950s, but was put to deadly use by Saddam Hussein in an attack against the Kurds in 1988. Yulia Skripal was on holiday visiting her father when they both collapsed in a Salisbury street Kim Jong-nam\u00a0was killed last February at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, when two women approached him and smeared cloths soaked with VX nerve agent across his face. The fast-acting toxin began to attack his nervous system and despite being able to alert officials, he was dead within 20 minutes. VX, which is the most deadly of all nerve agents, was first developed in the 1950s and is a tasteless and odorless liquid, which can be fatal for humans on skin contact. It penetrates the skin and disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, leading to a loss of consciousness, paralysis and eventually fatal respiratory failure. Counter-terror police, who are now leading the investigation into the Salisbury poisonings, will also be examining the 2012 death of Russian whistleblower, Alexander Perepilichnyy, who died in mysterious circumstances. Kim Jong-nam was assassinated with the nerve agent VX Credit: Shizuo Kambayashi\u00a0\/AP He was initially thought to have died of natural causes while out jogging, but traces of a deadly chemical was later found in his stomach. It was later suggested he could have been poisoned using the plant Gelsemium elegans, which had been secreted in the sorrel soup he ate shortly before he died. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the British Army\u2019s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment, said the attack had all the hallmarks of a toxic airborne nerve agent. A police tent covers the spot where Sergei Skripal and his daughter collapsed in Salisbury Credit: Frank Augstein\u00a0\/AP One theory being explored by counter-terrorism experts is that the substance was contained in an aerosol that was sprayed in the faces of Mr Skripal and his daughter. Officials have said there is no danger to the wider public, but have warned emergency workers who attended the scene, to be wary if they develop itchy skin or eyes or suffer from breathing problems. Video: CCTV shows 'persons of interest' in Salisbury Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who is now chief executive of Avon Protection Systems, told The Telegraph that\u00a0VX was one possibility in the Salisbury incident. He said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s a radiological isotope like polonium-210 that we saw with, Alexander Litvinenko, mainly because it takes considerable time to take effect. \u201cWith Litvinenko it wasn\u2019t obvious for two or three days. It would appear that whatever they took or were given or were attacked with, is rather quicker than that.\u201d Alexander Litvinenko, pictured in a UK hospital bed, was poisoned by a radioactive isotope Credit: PA Witnesses reported seeing Mr Skripal holding his hands in the air and shaking violently after he collapsed. Mr de Bretton-Gordon said: \"The shaking hands, and also I have also seen it described as him appearing to be frozen, that is sort of what nerve agents do, because they destroy your nerves.\u201d He also said the precautions taken by police, including the use of protection suits, is what would be expected, if they thought they were dealing with a toxin or nerve agent. Deadly toxins The other deadly toxins under the microscope Other deadly toxins which are likely to be tested for include the likes of Anthrax and Sarin, will be being tested for. Anthrax Anthrax, which is an infection caused by a bacteria, is invisible and odourless and can cause a painful death if inhaled into the lungs. In less concentrated doses it can cause severe itchiness and shortness of breath. Emergency workers, including the police who attended Mr Skripal, were warned be alert if they developed either of these conditions. Sarin Sarin, which was originally developed in Germany in the 1930s as a pesticide, is used in chemical warfare as a nerve agent. It can be absorbed through the skin, or by breathing it in and exposure to large amounts can lead to a painful death.","published_at":1520368512,"content_id":"ce136bdd-fe6d-30f0-9cd2-509c8024e645","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/russian-spy-may-targeted-deadly-172757245.html","content_published_at":1520412586,"content_time":1520412586,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean

Talks at Monday's\u00a0dinner were centred on a possible summit between the two nation\u2019s leaders, raising hopes of a breakthrough on the hermit kingdom\u2019s nuclear programme. A report by the official Korean Central News Agency said Mr Kim told the delegation he wanted to \"write a new history of reunification\" and also\u00a0discussed how to ease military tensions in the region. \u201cHearing the intention of President Moon Jae-in for a summit from the special envoy of the south side, he exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement,\u201d it said after yesterday\u2019s meeting without detailing what that agreement was. Mr Moon, the South Korean president, had dispatched Chung Eui-yong, his national security head, and Suh Hoon, his intelligence chief, to lead a 10-member delegation on a two-day trip to the North Korean capital.

Mr Kim\u2019s dinner invitation was confirmed by South Korea\u2019s presidential office, who said that it began at 6pm local time. The envoys were carrying a letter from Mr Moon to hand to their host. Photos provided by the president\u2019s office, also known by the Blue House, showed the delegation walking resolutely in dark suits across the tarmac after landing in Pyongyang after the short flight from Seoul. They were welcomed by Ri Son-gwon, chief of a North Korean agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. \u201cI plan to hold in-depth discussions on various ways to continue talks between not only the South and the North, but also the North and the United States and the international community,\u201d Mr Chung said shortly before his departure. Mr Moon and his aides have repeatedly stressed the importance of talks between Washington and Pyongyang, and for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. things facts you didn't know about north korea The issue has been a sticking point in finding a diplomatic resolution to ongoing tensions about Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The North Korean foreign ministry issued a statement at the weekend mocking US demands that it denuclearise as \u201cmore than ridiculous.\u201d Analysts, however, pointed out that while the envoys\u2019 visit could\u00a0facilitate a future\u00a0leaders summit, that the nuclear issue could not be avoided. \u201cMoon clearly wants to go,\u201d said Robert Kelly, professor of political science at South Korea\u2019s Busan University. \u201cThe real trick is making sure the North Koreans don\u2019t turn a summit into an anti-American prestige-seeking one.

Park fled North Korea at the age of 13,crossing the partly frozen Yalu River into China in 2007. She says she endured repeated sexual exploitation at the hands of a human trafficker and watched as her mother was sold off and forced to marry a Chinese farmer.

A classified military exercise last week, attended by Army chief of staff\u00a0General Mark Milley\u00a0and head of Special Operations Command\u00a0General Tony Thomas, tested hypothetical scenarios of how US troops would mobilise and strike if ordered to into a potential war, reported the New York Times. The \u201ctabletop exercise\u201d, held over a few days in Hawaii, thrashed out the challenges that could hamper a US\u00a0assault on North Korea\u2019s sizeable military. It determined that US casualties could be amplified by the Pentagon\u2019s limited ability to evacuate injured troops daily, and by the possibility that Pyongyang could retaliate with chemical weapons. Civilian casualties would far outweigh the initial toll on US troops, and could potentially reach hundreds of thousands, commanders were told. North Korea war puff While the US stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea, the capital, Seoul, a city of about 24 million, lies within range of the formidable firepower of North Korea\u2019s artillery stationed along the border. The potential human costs of any war were so high that, at one point in the exercise, General Milley remarked that \u201cthe brutality of this will be beyond the experience of any living soldier\u201d said the Times. Pentagon chiefs cautioned that the planning session did not mean that a decision has been made to go to war with the intention of curbing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. At a glance | US national missile defence On the back of a diplomatic d\u00e9tente with South Korea during the Winter Olympics, Pyongyang indicated that it was willing to open up dialogue with Washington. President Trump\u2019s response that \u201cwe want to talk also\u201d but \u201conly under the right conditions\u201d has created a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution. But America\u2019s insistence that denuclearisation must be on the table remains an entrenched sticking point. The unpredictable situation has sparked fears among US military leaders of a \u201cladder of escalation\u201d, where a stray incident could cause a military crisis to spiral out of control. South Korea flexes its military muscle after North's nuclear test Defence Secretary\u00a0Jim Mattis\u00a0has said a war with North Korea would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d but has reportedly ordered top Pentagon officials to be ready for any possible military action. Among the plans discussed last week was the redeployment of a large numbers of surveillance aircraft from the Middle East and Africa to the Pacific to support ground troops. Planners also looked at how American forces stationed in Japan and South Korea would be involved.","published_at":1520005697,"content_id":"8cf02fd8-4e4a-3a1a-bc87-3c4fda68c8b0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-war-could-apos-154447300.html","content_published_at":1520005487,"content_time":1520005487,"content_relative_time":126,"reaction_count":2,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-08d57c4d-71b2-32c4-a75b-696af517d55c_a-bcbe009d-ffb5-3f93-b9b5-dbd9211ea643","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-08d57c4d-71b2-32c4-a75b-696af517d55c_a-bcbe009d-ffb5-3f93-b9b5-dbd9211ea643","author":"third_watch","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/satan-2-putin-tells-u-121319520.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/59nPyUjN8W_9HMOjxR1M3w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/e5454b0e1cabe40c0b7c97fed574ed52","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JJN.9bd1FvwG8biMji_Luw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD05NTI7dz0xNDgwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/e5454b0e1cabe40c0b7c97fed574ed52","height":952,"width":1480,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/e5454b0e1cabe40c0b7c97fed574ed52","imgw":1480,"imgh":952,"title":"Satan 2: Putin Tells U.S. 'You Will Listen To Russia Now' as he Deploys Hypersonic Nuclear ICBM","summary":"Russian\u00a0President Vladimir Putin said Russia is developing a new generation of advanced nuclear weapons including a hypersonic intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can reach almost anywhere in the world and cannot be shot down by anti-missile systems.

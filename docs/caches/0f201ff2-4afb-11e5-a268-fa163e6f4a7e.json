Talks at Monday's\u00a0dinner were centred on a possible summit between the two nation\u2019s leaders, raising hopes of a breakthrough on the hermit kingdom\u2019s nuclear programme. A report by the official Korean Central News Agency said Mr Kim told the delegation he wanted to \"write a new history of reunification\" and also\u00a0discussed how to ease military tensions in the region. \u201cHearing the intention of President Moon Jae-in for a summit from the special envoy of the south side, he exchanged views and made a satisfactory agreement,\u201d it said after yesterday\u2019s meeting without detailing what that agreement was. Mr Moon, the South Korean president, had dispatched Chung Eui-yong, his national security head, and Suh Hoon, his intelligence chief, to lead a 10-member delegation on a two-day trip to the North Korean capital.

Mr Kim\u2019s dinner invitation was confirmed by South Korea\u2019s presidential office, who said that it began at 6pm local time. The envoys were carrying a letter from Mr Moon to hand to their host. Photos provided by the president\u2019s office, also known by the Blue House, showed the delegation walking resolutely in dark suits across the tarmac after landing in Pyongyang after the short flight from Seoul. They were welcomed by Ri Son-gwon, chief of a North Korean agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. \u201cI plan to hold in-depth discussions on various ways to continue talks between not only the South and the North, but also the North and the United States and the international community,\u201d Mr Chung said shortly before his departure. Mr Moon and his aides have repeatedly stressed the importance of talks between Washington and Pyongyang, and for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. things facts you didn't know about north korea The issue has been a sticking point in finding a diplomatic resolution to ongoing tensions about Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The North Korean foreign ministry issued a statement at the weekend mocking US demands that it denuclearise as \u201cmore than ridiculous.\u201d Analysts, however, pointed out that while the envoys\u2019 visit could\u00a0facilitate a future\u00a0leaders summit, that the nuclear issue could not be avoided. \u201cMoon clearly wants to go,\u201d said Robert Kelly, professor of political science at South Korea\u2019s Busan University. \u201cThe real trick is making sure the North Koreans don\u2019t turn a summit into an anti-American prestige-seeking one. It\u2019s got to deal with the nuclear weapons one way or another.\u201d","published_at":1520314399,"content_id":"c08aa3a5-f902-3ab2-9eef-f3484c311d52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/kim-jong-un-surprise-move-100653065.html","content_published_at":1520293370,"content_time":1520293370,"content_relative_time":8,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-21cc3e20-8c82-31f9-a63c-3ad21d9dd6f7_a-9bb9b464-1de3-38f0-b3d8-3ce7cd3cbed5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-21cc3e20-8c82-31f9-a63c-3ad21d9dd6f7_a-9bb9b464-1de3-38f0-b3d8-3ce7cd3cbed5","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/n-koreas-kim-seoul-envoys-discuss-easing-tensions-230540074.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kcyil.MJhqbHN3olpLVWZQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/ef6c7d00bba92afd28fbee0542cc4d1ec5b92d79.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DGtd42TDNEiXPShx9eu20Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/ef6c7d00bba92afd28fbee0542cc4d1ec5b92d79.jpg","height":682,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/ef6c7d00bba92afd28fbee0542cc4d1ec5b92d79.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":682,"title":"Kim Jong Un and Seoul envoys discuss possible inter-Korean summit","summary":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un discussed a possible summit with envoys from the South's President Moon Jae-in, both sides said Tuesday, in the latest step of an Olympics-driven rapprochement on the divided peninsula.

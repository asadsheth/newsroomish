One of the Cold War's strangest dramas began in 1965 when Charles Robert Jenkins, then a 24-year-old army sergeant nicknamed \"Scooter\" from tiny Rich Square in North Carolina, disappeared one January night while on patrol near the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. At an emotional court martial in Japan in 2004, Jenkins - who had never gone to high school - said he deserted to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and escape combat in Vietnam.","published_at":1513104841,"content_id":"870524f8-83ac-35e9-abd3-bcadce735151","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-soldier-deserted-north-korea-1965-dies-aged-023747546.html","content_published_at":1513091290,"content_time":1513091290,"content_relative_time":9,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-a171e2d8-22b9-3cba-b99c-5440621c2e6a_a-83ddd048-2abd-3d92-bcdd-d2aa57792a24","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-a171e2d8-22b9-3cba-b99c-5440621c2e6a_a-83ddd048-2abd-3d92-bcdd-d2aa57792a24","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"POPSUGAR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Donald-Trump-Kim-Jong-un-Hair-Swap-Meme-43868468","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RBIY.8YhfF00VMLhfk5QXQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Q8r2mCZU2XAwgKpdoRhlQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_83ddd048-2abd-3d92-bcdd-d2aa57792a24--1684243319.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Drxo.EgO4eaDnWGzDoSkeg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Q8r2mCZU2XAwgKpdoRhlQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_83ddd048-2abd-3d92-bcdd-d2aa57792a24--1684243319.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5Q8r2mCZU2XAwgKpdoRhlQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_83ddd048-2abd-3d92-bcdd-d2aa57792a24--1684243319.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"An Evil Genius Swapped Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un's Hair and We Can't Look Away","summary":"President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un may be dominating the news right now with a looming threat of all-out war, but it certainly isn't keeping the internet from poking a bit of fun at the two superpowerful men.

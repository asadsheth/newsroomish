Salma Hayek and Kristen Stewart were also among 82 actresses, female producers and directors who marched arm in arm to demand equality and \u201ca safe workplace\u201d seven months after the fall of Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul accused of rape and sexual harassment. The protest highlighted that only 82 films directed by women have been selected for the festival\u2019s prestigious Palme d\u2019Or competition in its 71-year history, compared with 1,645 directed by men. Blanchett, who is presiding the jury this year awarding the coveted Palme d\u2019Or award, one of the film industry\u2019s highest honours, said: \u201cWe demand that our workplaces are diverse and equitable so they can best reflect the world in which we live.\u201d Cate Blanchett made a speech demanding workplace equality\u00a0 Credit: Dominique Charriau\u00a0\/Wireimage She said female stars were calling for \u201ca world that allows all of us, in front and behind the camera, to thrive shoulder to shoulder with our male colleagues.\u201d Jane Campion is the only female director to have won the Palme d\u2019Or, for her 1993 film, \u201cThe Piano\u201d. The march up the red-carpeted steps came before an unprecedented move by the festival to sign \u201cstrong commitments\u201d on parity and diversity on Monday. Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the festival director, said he supported the march as a way for women \u201cto affirm their presence\u201d. \u00a082 actresses, female producers and directors who marched arm in arm to demand equality Credit: Dominique Charriau\/WireImage Just hours earlier, Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, France\u2019s minister for gender equality, revealed that several women attending the event had called a special helpline for women to report sexual harassment at the festival. \u201cA female responder who took one of the calls escorted an\u00a0Anglo-Saxon woman to a police station to file a complaint on Friday night,\u201d Ms Schiappa said. The term \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 is used in French to mean someone from an English-speaking country. Neither the complainant nor the alleged attacker have been identified.\u00a0 The line was set up for the first time this year following four alleged attacks at the festival in previous years by\u00a0 Weinstein. Salma Hayek was among the women at the red carpet protest Credit: ALBERTO PIZZOLI\/AFP The #MeToo movement has thrown the spotlight on harassment and 40,000 flyers were handed out at this year\u2019s festival reminding guests that sexual harassment can be punished in France by three years in prison and a \u00a340,000 fine. Cannes has also come under scrutiny over the small number of female directors selected for its competition. Mr Fr\u00e9maux insisted that the festival chooses films solely for their quality, but he has promised to make selection committees gender-balanced. After the march, the festival screened Eva Husson\u2019s \u201cGirls of the Sun,\u201d which tells the story of Kurdish women fighters. Husson, a French director, is one of only three women whose films are among the 21 selected for the competition this year. The others are Nadine Labaki\u2019s \u201cCapernaum\u201d and Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s \u201cHappy as Lazzaro\u201d, which are to premiere next week.","published_at":1526218599,"content_id":"44eb247b-6a93-3c63-9948-1c62cf42eeea","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/cate-blanchett-leads-82-woman-170953097.html","content_published_at":1526144993,"content_time":1526144993,"content_relative_time":293,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Harvey Weinstein","vibe_id":"3d3bc94f-6dda-3fd6-80e5-7faadd89a194","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-3d3bc94f-6dda-3fd6-80e5-7faadd89a194_c-2174dbdc-fc0b-3503-81fe-80eed131aba5_a-b230cc29-7619-3b5a-b24b-b04bbc511b84","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/harvey-weinstein\/ronan-farrow-woody-weinstein-3wojs8a","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"the Guardian","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2018\/may\/13\/ronan-farrow-interview-woody-allen-harvey-weinstein-me-too","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/318bSjtb78HdX9AB13bF.A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nPmdddy_wvsUlbHQWpvhUA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b230cc29-7619-3b5a-b24b-b04bbc511b84-1120979448.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/awIyDUEDmkDR5LvwRYk3fg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nPmdddy_wvsUlbHQWpvhUA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b230cc29-7619-3b5a-b24b-b04bbc511b84-1120979448.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nPmdddy_wvsUlbHQWpvhUA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b230cc29-7619-3b5a-b24b-b04bbc511b84-1120979448.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Ronan Farrow: Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein and me","summary":"Ronan Farrow, the son of Mia and Woody Allen, is the Pulitzer-prize winning journalist whose expos\u00e9 triggered #MeToo.

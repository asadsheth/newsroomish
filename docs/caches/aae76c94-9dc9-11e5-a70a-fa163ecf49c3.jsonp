Both players are scheduled to be free agents and could command\u00a0contracts well in excess of $250 million. The\u00a0Yankees and\u00a0Phillies have been linked to both players, since both clubs should have deep pockets for free agency. But at least when it comes to Machado, the Phillies have an ace up their sleeve: farm director\u00a0Joe Jordan, per Philly.com. Jordan, now the Phillies farm director, was responsible for drafting Machado with Baltimore's third overall pick in 2010.

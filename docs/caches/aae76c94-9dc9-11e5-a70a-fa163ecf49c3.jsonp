At one point in losing Western Conference Final Game 7 to Golden State, Houston missed 27 consecutive threes and made just seven of 44 in all. If you are wondering why a New York Post baseball columnist is writing about this, here it is: If you can live by the three, die by the three in the NBA, could you live by avoiding No. 1 in the majors and die by it as well?

There's a reason when you see Brewers gear in public, it's the old baseball glove logo. However, as SNY reporter Steve Gelbs pointed out on Twitter, the logo is even better than a lot of people realize. As Gelbs notes, there is an \"M\" and a \"B\" -- the Brewers' initials -- blended into the logo. The great thing about this tweet is that it's presented like something that's common knowledge by now, but it couldn't be more obvious that Gelbs knows full well that he's about to blow everyone's mind. He wasn't wrong. Other people noticed before Gelbs pointed it out, it just took a little while.

Noah Syndergaard was placed on the disabled list Tuesday, retroactive to May 26, for a strained ligament in his right index finger. The pitcher was examined at The Hospital for Special Surgery on Tuesday for soreness in his finger. The 25-year-old is 4-1 with a 3.06 ERA this season, and while he hadn't yet been the Syndergaard of old, he had been a source of consistency for a Mets rotation that has experienced anything but. Fellow ace Jacob deGrom already had a DL stint himself earlier this season and Jason Vargas has been brutal in four of five starts since coming off the DL. Steven Matz and Zack Wheeler have also been up and down.

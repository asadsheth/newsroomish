They traded Todd Frazier in an offseason that was overstuffed with third basemen, not the previous trade deadline, when he was an all-star on pace to hit 45 or 50 homers. They traded Johnny Cueto when he had a couple of months left on his contract, not a year-plus, when he would have netted all of the prospects. Brandon Phillips rejected trades that would have helped. And, of course, they traded Aroldis Chapman in the two-month window when teams pretended to care about his domestic violence case, which meant they got a modest return.

The Reds hadn't changed managers so early in a season since Tony Perez was fired after 44 games in 1993. It's the first time since 2002 that a manager has been fired in April, according to ESPN. Four managers were fired that April, including Phil Garner after an 0-6 start with the Tigers that matched the quickest hook in major league history.

Still, the Red Sox are in rarified historical air. As ESPN noted, Boston's 15-2 start has been matched by only six other teams since the beginning of the live-ball era in 1920.

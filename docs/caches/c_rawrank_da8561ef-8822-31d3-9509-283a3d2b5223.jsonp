As the government rolls out \u00a314 billion of welfare cuts, the think tank warned that these were damaging the prospects of eight million low- and middle-income households, offsetting the impact of any increase in the national living wage. The report, \u201cThe Living Standards Outlook,\u201d looks at what may happen with household incomes and inequalities over the next five years, examining in some detail the real spending power of typical households and the distribution of income. Low to Middle Income households (LMI) are defined as those families, including single parent families, that are part of the bottom half of the non-pensioner income distribution.","published_at":1522016426,"content_id":"29ffc6f2-947b-3998-912e-09354da07ae2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.wsws.org\/en\/articles\/2018\/03\/24\/reso-m24.html","content_published_at":1521867600,"content_time":1521867600,"content_relative_time":90,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":90,"comment_relative_time":90,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"221c9386-6fbd-3ca1-917d-73889cb51b44","post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-7468ffd2-bf7b-3a6d-8344-bf6553fcf4fc_a-221c9386-6fbd-3ca1-917d-73889cb51b44","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-7468ffd2-bf7b-3a6d-8344-bf6553fcf4fc_a-221c9386-6fbd-3ca1-917d-73889cb51b44","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/stocks-bonds-offer-better-value-3csat90","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"morningstar.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/news\/market-watch\/TDJNMW_20180321375\/update-do-stocks-or-bonds-offer-the-better-value-over-the-coming-decade.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"UPDATE: Do stocks or bonds offer the better value over the coming decade?","summary":"By almost any metric, U.S. investors have been better off in the stock market than in fixed income over the past decade, with equities seeing little in the way of volatility or pullbacks (http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/the-last-time-stocks-were-this-quiet-was-the-year-the-beatles-went-on-ed-sullivan-2017-12-14), along with growth that far eclipsed the gains seen in bonds.

Pueblo Fire Department spokesman Erik Duran said the fire is believed to have originated at an established homeless camp in the area, but its direct cause is currently unknown. The area had coincidentally been visited by emergency responders from multiple agencies earlier in the day during a homeless outreach program.","published_at":1522998168,"content_id":"1a2bc02e-81fa-3941-a553-efb3d03d22e8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.chieftain.com\/news\/pueblo\/wildland-fire-near-u-s-and-i--bypass\/article_06aec87e-3846-11e8-890b-17912e53b533.html","content_published_at":1522872900,"content_time":1522872900,"content_relative_time":142,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":142,"comment_relative_time":142,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"38d4fb6d-5c89-39b0-b856-85959fbb2f29","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-c745795a-a057-360d-8d43-c9a2144a4a3b_a-38d4fb6d-5c89-39b0-b856-85959fbb2f29","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-c745795a-a057-360d-8d43-c9a2144a4a3b_a-38d4fb6d-5c89-39b0-b856-85959fbb2f29","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/california-fights-wildfires-aggressively-%E2%80%94-4r4k16n","author":"nanook","provider":"Whittier Daily News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.whittierdailynews.com\/2018\/04\/04\/california-fights-wildfires-aggressively-but-prevention-takes-a-back-seat\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ca6LJJsp5tBPuS6X0z4AEQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x7E2ndDsbG9AweFJ0MoQtA--\/dz04MTA7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_38d4fb6d-5c89-39b0-b856-85959fbb2f29--340470224.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zvXHTEyZU39TmFDINL19IQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NDU7dz04MTA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x7E2ndDsbG9AweFJ0MoQtA--\/dz04MTA7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_38d4fb6d-5c89-39b0-b856-85959fbb2f29--340470224.jpeg","height":545,"width":810,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x7E2ndDsbG9AweFJ0MoQtA--\/dz04MTA7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_38d4fb6d-5c89-39b0-b856-85959fbb2f29--340470224.jpeg","imgw":810,"imgh":545,"title":"California fights wildfires aggressively \u2014 but prevention takes a back seat","summary":"Dave Kinateder has a keen eye for trees. \u201cIt's a ticking time bomb,\u201d he said, gazing across the dense, green carpet of trees near Quincy, a small community high in the northern Sierra Nevada.

I know they were old (my cat was 19!) but it seems so wrong that they would all die this way. Is it my imagination or are cats and dogs getting cancer more often than the used to? A: It's a fact: If we're lucky to live long enough, we'll all get cancer. It's just how aging mammalian cells fail. Mistakes in the repair mechanism of cells, many of them genetically preprogrammed, will lead to a failure of proper self-editing. Affected cells will lose their normal control mechanisms and the new tissues they comprise will grow abnormally.

FIVE. YEARS.

And lived with a women [sic] for a little while in yet another city.\"\u00a0 Apparently the woman who adapted Panther kept him until she couldn't any longer, and ultimately gave him to her parents\u2014who just so happened to be @ngvhi's neighbor. So, for over a year, Panther (whose name changed to Charlie) was literally living his best indoor cat life right next door. \"These happen to be the neighbors that bought a Siberian husky that quickly turned out to be too much to handle. I started taking care of him until they asked if I wanted to fully adopt him,\" she continued. Yep that's right, this story also involves a doggo. The neighbors took in her cat, unknowingly, and she ended up with their dog.\u00a0 of course I said yes which is why last year I adopted my beautiful baby boy trotsky.

THEY\u2019D LIVED TOGETHER BEFORE,\" @ngvhi wrote.\u00a0 \"Our neighbors were as flabbergasted as us and insisted we keep him because he really was ours. we (I was overruled) decided to give him back since he was comfortable there and we already have a dog and cat,\" she tweeted.\u00a0 \"It was heartbreaking but I can\u2019t even be sad bc today was truly surreal.

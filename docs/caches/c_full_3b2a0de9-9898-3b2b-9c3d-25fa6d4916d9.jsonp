Here are some tips to teach your dog to not jump on people. \u2014 Global Animal The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) Dogs greet each other nose-to-nose and want to do the same with us. Since our noses are not at their level, they jump up to reach them. Does your dog jump on you as if he's got springs on his feet? Like it or not, we humans are to blame. We not only permit this behavior, we encourage it. We know we shouldn't encourage jumping, but a fuzzy puppy is just too cute to resist.

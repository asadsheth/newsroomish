She was unmanageable, aggressive toward children and other pets, and came within two hours of being destroyed. Now she's up for a national award as a hero dog. Each time Ruby was returned to the East Providence shelter of the Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, volunteer dog trainer Patricia Inman worked with her to make her more adoptable.

Police acting on a tip from a neighbor who saw a post about the animal on social media visited the man's home in Yongsheng county, Yunnan province, and found the 176-pound bear being kept in a cage. The man, identified only by the surname Yang, told investigators he had found what he thought was a puppy while foraging for mushrooms in the mountains near his home in April 2015 and only realized it wasn't a dog when it grew large. Asian black bears are considered a protected species in China and those found to be keeping them without forest authority approval can face fines of up to $475, but authorities said Yang was not fined because the bear was found to be in good health and the man cooperated with the investigation.","published_at":1520959661,"content_id":"c65ad35c-3699-3f50-9ef2-7ddfd2ddb62c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Odd_News\/2018\/03\/13\/Chinese-man-with-pet-bear-initially-thought-it-was-a-puppy\/9771520958619\/","content_published_at":1520959307,"content_time":1520959307,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"3424a39c-11f3-32ff-8afa-98a0c31a335c","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-b51696a7-eb99-386a-bb0e-b106270c17e2_a-3424a39c-11f3-32ff-8afa-98a0c31a335c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

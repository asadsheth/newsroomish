This response is commonly known to dog parents as jumping out of bed because the dog is about to barf. It is normal for dogs to get an occasional upset stomach just as we do. Causes vary from environmental to physiological related changes due to weather, seasonal or food allergies, eating something they shouldn't have, or aging. Dogs cannot tell us that they are sick or just how sick they are, so unless your dog has a diagnosed stomach or intestinal issue, it can be difficult to really know if the issue is mild or severe.

However, accidents happen, and it's always a good time to educate yourself on how common dog bites really are. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control found that at least 42 percent of all dog bites happen to children under the age of 14, and that number has continued to increase with time. So, as a parent, what can you do? We spoke with Dr. Evan Weiner, director of emergency medicine at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, who explained what measures should be taken if a dog bites your child.

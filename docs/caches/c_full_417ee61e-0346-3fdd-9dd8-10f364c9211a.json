Afghanistan\u2019s farmers grew more than 1,250 square miles of opium poppy last year, paving the way for potentially unseen levels of heroin production. The bumper crop has the potential to make up to 900 tonnes of high purity, export quality heroin the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime said. Afghan opium already provides more than 90 per cent of the world\u2019s heroin and 95 per cent of that found on Britain\u2019s streets.\u00a0 The trade also finances militant groups such as the Taliban, forcing the UK to spend tens of millions in the past 15 years trying to destroy poppy crops. But production in Helmand province alone, the capital of opium growing where Britain spent eight years trying to wean Afghans off the crop, has risen by 79 per cent in a single year. An Afghan farmer walks along the poppy field on the outskirts Mazar-i-Sharif Credit: \u00a0FARSHAD USYAN\/AFP \u201cWith the record high of production in 2017, a wave of high quality, low cost heroin is expected to reach consumer markets across the world,\u201d the UN warned. It said \u201cunprecedented amounts of heroin\u201d will reach drug users \u201cwith increased consumption and related harms as a likely consequence.\u201d Poor security and the Kabul government\u2019s lack of control in swathes of the country were blamed for the burgeoning trade. Opium now dwarfs all other sectors of the Afghan economy, despite a 17-year-long international aid campaign to try to rebuild the country after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001. The crop was worth up to \u00a35bn, or nearly a third of the country\u2019s entire GDP, while legal exports are worth only around seven per cent. Many billions more are made further down the drugs pipeline, as it is smuggled across the Middle East into Europe. Impoverished farmers are now increasingly reliant on the crop, and it is now the backbone of Afghan agriculture, making efforts to curb the trade harder. The UN said: \u201cThe 2017 record levels of cultivation and production further show the dependency of Afghanistan\u2019s rural economy on opium cultivation.\u201d","published_at":1527001222,"content_id":"ed0b84bb-32d0-3e2e-b6af-b128c010a695","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/apos-unprecedented-apos-surge-cheap-145734907.html","content_published_at":1527001054,"content_time":1527001054,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"War in Afghanistan","vibe_id":"417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":31,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409","post_id":"v-417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a_c-233a68a1-3e59-3719-8317-f5ff9b4412b7_a-350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a_c-233a68a1-3e59-3719-8317-f5ff9b4412b7_a-350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/war-in-afghanistan\/v-417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a_c-233a68a1-3e59-3719-8317-f5ff9b4412b7_a-350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409","author":"nanook","provider":"CBS Local","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/newyork.cbslocal.com\/2018\/05\/21\/state-university-of-new-york-places-high-ranking-sergio-a-garcia-on-leave-due-to-suspect-claims\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HFujwwOxla9fOMBQu0IGbA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gnJj87imqBIO3bVycmnoSg--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409-1397323198.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TNJCWEQ.wxhvfQaCOTrh1w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gnJj87imqBIO3bVycmnoSg--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409-1397323198.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gnJj87imqBIO3bVycmnoSg--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_350fc4dc-e7e2-3957-9052-762963f6d409-1397323198.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"High-Ranking SUNY Official Reportedly Resigns Due To Suspect Claims","summary":"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 A highly paid New York state worker is under fire for exaggerating his experiences and qualifications.

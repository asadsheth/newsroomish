Leaning out of his car window to shout a friendly greeting, the Prince left the object of Frankie O\u2019Leary\u2019s affection open-mouthed with shock and not a little impressed. Fast-forward to 2018 and that young lady is now his wife, with Corporal of Horse O\u2019Leary to return the romantic favour as he takes a starring role in Prince Harry\u2019s own wedding. CoH O\u2019Leary, who got to know Prince Harry as his radio operator in Afghanistan in 2007, will be riding at the front of the carriage carrying the newlywed Prince and Meghan Markle around Windsor, in a remarkable moment in both of their lives. Describing the Prince as \u201ca man of courage, a man of honour, a genuinely honest, kind man\u201d, he joked that he had \u201cpulled a cracker\u201d in Ms Markle. CoH Frankie O'Leary who served with Prince Harry in Afghanistan Credit: Julian Simmonds CoH O\u2019Leary joined colleagues at the Hyde Park Barracks, Knightsbridge, on Wednesday,\u00a0where the ceremonial regiment is preparing for their official role at the wedding. They will provide a staircase party at St George\u2019s Chapel and a mounted Travelling Escort for the carriage ride through Windsor. Asked for his memories of serving with the Prince, he said he showed the same love of a joke and trying to keep spirits up as any other fellow soldier, coping with being tired and hungry with \"that touch of British officer class\u201d. On how his former superior, for whom he used to make sausage and beans for breakfast every day, had changed, he admitted: \u201cHe\u2019s got a really untidy beard. If he was still serving he\u2019d be in trouble.\u201d But none of his memories compared with how the Prince accidentally helped while he was on one of his first dates with Niina, walking back to barracks in Windsor. Corporal of Horse Frankie O'Leary and his wife Niina \u201cHe [Prince Harry] saw me walking with a young lady,\u201d CoH O\u2019Leary said. \u201cUnbeknownst to me, he was driving on his own, just going for a spin like you do as an English prince. \u201cHe wound the window down and said \u2018see you later, Frank\u2019. I was like, \u2018see you later, Sir\u2019. \u201cI carried on walking. The young lady was a few steps behind me with her jaw on the floor like \u2018...was that\u2026?\u2019 \u201cI played it cool.\" Pressed on how the story ended, he disclosed: \"She became my wife.\u201d The Household Cavalry prepare for the Royal wedding Credit: Julian Simmonds CoH O\u2019Leary will be one of 24 soldiers and two officers in the Travelling Escort on May 19, with Corporal Major Dan Snoxell, who was in Prince Harry\u2019s troop for more than a year, joining the Cavalry lining the chapel staircase. Commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Regiment Lieutenant Colonel James Gaselee, whose\u00a0sister was a bridesmaid at Prince Charles and Diana's wedding and whose father trained Charles as an amateur jockey,\u00a0will command the travelling mounted escort. Prince Harry joined The Blues and Royals in April 2006 and served with the Household\u00a0Cavalry\u00a0Regiment, based in Combermere Barracks in Windsor, undertaking two tours of Afghanistan and rising to the rank of captain. On the morning of the wedding, the serving soldiers will spend hours cleaning their breast plates, helmets, swords and the dreaded thigh-high jack boots they wear, which can take hours to turn from a dull surface to patent-like leather. They will also have to make sure all the tack on their horses is in pristine condition and ready to be seen by the thousands of spectators who will line the wedding route in Windsor. Master Tailor Adam Blackmore-Heal makes adjustments to a uniform in preparation for the Royal wedding Credit: Julian Simmonds Cpl Major Snoxell, 32, told how the Prince had remained in contact since he left the Army, including sending a message of congratulations to a talented new recruit. Asked whether Prince Harry\u2019s experience with the Blues and Royals would mean he spots any mistakes from his former colleagues during the procession, CoH O\u2019Leary said: \u201cHe may well give me some abuse about my sword position or my riding position, who knows. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be more excited by the fact he\u2019s pulled a cracker and he gets to take her home.\u201d Of excitement building for the wedding day, he added: \u201cIt will be a wonderful occasion. It\u2019s Britain, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019ll be flags, horses, a castle, men in armour, men in big furry hats, drums beating. \u201cNo-one does it better.\u201d","published_at":1525884214,"content_id":"9e84a33a-d115-341a-8c40-0dabf013562a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/soldier-served-prince-harry-ride-200000323.html","content_published_at":1525896000,"content_time":1525896000,"content_relative_time":119,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"War in Afghanistan","vibe_id":"417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":119,"comment_relative_time":119,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa","post_id":"v-417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a_c-a3c1da46-ca93-392e-8f4a-8c9a87f16473_a-141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a_c-a3c1da46-ca93-392e-8f4a-8c9a87f16473_a-141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/war-in-afghanistan\/v-417ee61e-0346-3fdd-9dd8-10f364c9211a_c-a3c1da46-ca93-392e-8f4a-8c9a87f16473_a-141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa","author":"third_watch","provider":"https:\/\/www.oneindia.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.oneindia.com\/india\/earthquake-tremors-felt-kashmir-valley-delhi-ncr-2693087.html?utm_source=\/rss\/news-india-fb.xml&utm_medium=63.243.230.7&utm_campaign=client-rss","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N3pUKwzPR4QBjiRTWJgGtA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Uc8qfaqgZNucEm0zDt63Lg--\/dz02MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa--1808859640.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NlYPmh1Zw1Iil.ptwnGuAw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NTA7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Uc8qfaqgZNucEm0zDt63Lg--\/dz02MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa--1808859640.jpeg","height":450,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Uc8qfaqgZNucEm0zDt63Lg--\/dz02MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_141ee8db-12a9-3538-b903-e87c281a40fa--1808859640.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":450,"title":"Tremors felt across Kashmir valley, Delhi-NCR after 6.2 magnitude quake hits Afghanistan","summary":"Earthquake tremors were felt in Delhi-NCR and Kashmir on Wednesday afternoon after an earthquake of magnitude 6.2 struck Afghanistan and Pakistan.

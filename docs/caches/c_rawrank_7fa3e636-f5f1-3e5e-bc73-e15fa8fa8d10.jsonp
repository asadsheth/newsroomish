Sir Richard Branson\u2019s train company stoked political controversy last year when it emerged its joint venture which runs the East Coast mainline with Stagecoach would have to hand the keys to the franchise back years early. The pair were accused of overbidding for the franchise by Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, while the companies blamed macroeconomic factors and uncompleted Network Rail upgrades for preventing the joint venture from hitting its targets.\u00a0 The companies have also reiterated that they have met the financial obligations of the contract, including using all of a \u00a3165m parent company bond, put in place at the start of the franchise to ensure the Government receives its payments if a rail operator is struggling. \u00a0 \u00a0 Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is under political fire over the collapse of the East Coast mainline franchise agreement Credit: John Robertson\/John Robertson \u00a0 But transport minister Jo Johnson has responded to a written question from Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, stating his department is \u201ckeeping Virgin\u2019s eligibility for current and future bids under close scrutiny and constant review\u201d. The comments come just a couple of months after Mr Grayling extended Virgin Trains\u2019 contract on the West Coast mainline through to 2019.\u00a0 The Secretary of State defended the decision by stating Virgin was the majority shareholder on the West Coast line, unlike the East Coast which is 90pc controlled by Stagecoach. Any rebuke of Virgin Trains by the Government seems unlikely to involve removing its ability to bid for future rail franchises though.\u00a0 \u00a0 Labour manifesto policy | Rail \u00a0 Mr Grayling has said there are \u201cno adequate legal grounds\u201d to restrict either company from bidding for future rail contracts. Mr McDonald said: \u201cLabour believes franchise failure must mean forfeit so it is good that the Government is reviewing the company\u2019s right to bid for rail franchises.

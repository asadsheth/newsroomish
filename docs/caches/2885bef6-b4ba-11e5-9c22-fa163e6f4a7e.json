The proposed Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance was filed with the Deschutes County clerk last week. The county in central Oregon tends to be conservative, with most rural voters voting for Donald Trump. Gun control advocates, meanwhile, are collecting signatures to qualify a measure for the statewide ballot that would restrict assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines.","published_at":1524513863,"content_id":"00a5b542-30df-3f72-a224-0cd11e271fb8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2018\/apr\/23\/effort-in-oregon-county-would-ban-enforcing-gun-co\/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS","content_published_at":1524513469,"content_time":1524513469,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Gun control debate","vibe_id":"2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-55c3ab37-92a1-3f28-aba3-3412f5196a3e_a-6f20d947-4bf6-3f03-af33-45ce52c02577","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/gun-control-debate\/why-kentucky-dad-keeping-ar-3f70wv7","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Time","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.time.com","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-01-26\/09bccbd0-c46f-11e5-851b-2f7c2e153f2a_d2f592afeb9263b1727d436e299e2bda.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/why-kentucky-dad-keeping-ar-161812883.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5fNTDd4upCfq.JhrjJl0uA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/time_72\/5e00c15e4a451655757b2fa99b6030d5","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PnHGjkpZIDrrtdsbai4cyw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMTMzO3c9MzI0Njs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/time_72\/5e00c15e4a451655757b2fa99b6030d5","height":2133,"width":3246,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/time_72\/5e00c15e4a451655757b2fa99b6030d5","imgw":3246,"imgh":2133,"title":"Why a Kentucky Dad Is Keeping His AR-15 After His Daughter Was Wounded in a School Shooting","summary":"\"Please stop talking about AR-15s.

Sales of smart speakers are expected to nearly double in the US, to $3.8 billion, from last year according to Lesley Rohrbaugh and Steve Koenig, researchers with the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the annual CES trade event. Being able to order items, select music, get information, and more by speaking to digital assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana has been such a hit that pressure will be on for more ways to interact with machines using voice, the researchers predicted.","published_at":1515441682,"content_id":"6b14cf20-3ea7-3c6f-8464-d2cde3b894a7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/virtual-aide-market-wildfire-ces-gadget-show-025807302.html","content_published_at":1515380287,"content_time":1515380287,"content_relative_time":69,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

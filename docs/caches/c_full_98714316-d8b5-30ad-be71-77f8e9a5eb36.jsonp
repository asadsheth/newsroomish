The world's second richest man took part in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Tuesday, during which he was asked about his thoughts on cryptocurrency. The technology has soared in popularity over the past year as the price of Bitcoin soared to almost $20,000.\u00a0 Part of the appeal of the digital cash is the anonymity it grants holders. It uses decentralised technology for secure payments and storing money that doesn't require banks or people's names. But while that feature is lauded by some, Mr Gates said it was not \"a good thing\". \u201cThe Governments [sic] ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing,\u201d Mr Gates wrote. Bitcoin | Your essential guide He also noted that\u00a0cryptocurrency can be used easily to purchase drugs online \u00a0and had \u201ccaused deaths in a fairly direct way\u201d. \u201cRight now cryptocurrencies are used for buying Fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and cryptocurrencies is super risky for those who go long,\u201d he said.\u00a0 One Reddit user pointed out that people can also buy drugs with regular cash.\u00a0 \u201cYes \u2013 anonymous cash is used for these kinds of things but you have to be physically present to transfer it which makes things like kidnapping payments more difficult,\u201d he said. What is cryptocurrency, how does it work and why do we use it? The criticism contrasts with his praise of it in 2014 when \u00a0he said Bitcoin is \"better than currency,\u201d and that it \u201cis exciting because it shows how cheap (transactions) can be\u201d. He has also praised the technology behind it.\u00a0\u00a0During a BackChannel interview in 2015, he said people needed to \u201cdraw on the revolution of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin alone is not good enough.\u201d And as a sign of the benefits he sees in the field, the\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation partnered with cryptocurrency firm Ripple in October\u00a0in a bid to help those around the world who are unable to use or access banks.\u00a0 Ripple has been soaring in popularity and has been closing in on Bitcoin's market lead.","published_at":1519767258,"content_id":"adca57c5-2cbf-3b8f-8d9a-04d68335bf83","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/bill-gates-warns-cryptocurrency-apos-012551844.html","content_published_at":1519781151,"content_time":1519781151,"content_relative_time":44,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":44,"comment_relative_time":44,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80","post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-6574240e-c6ad-38df-a012-e65071bc9676_a-4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-6574240e-c6ad-38df-a012-e65071bc9676_a-4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-6574240e-c6ad-38df-a012-e65071bc9676_a-4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80","author":"third_watch","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/goldman-sachs-outlook-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-2018-2","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EhkOcEIBh50hLrkYpR3Wjw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/UHf3h_Bypock_PwJfItxWA--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80-1576992589.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qHXyOJs3.R6g0zvqa6tpVQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNzU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/UHf3h_Bypock_PwJfItxWA--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80-1576992589.jpeg","height":375,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/UHf3h_Bypock_PwJfItxWA--\/dz03NTA7aD0zNzU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e652710-c718-3722-935e-9ac1c85b4f80-1576992589.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":375,"title":"Goldman Sachs investment chief: Bitcoin is definitely a bubble, Ethereum even more so","summary":"Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani is the CIO of the Private Wealth Management Group at Goldman Sachs where she guides the investment strategy for clients with over $10 million in assets.

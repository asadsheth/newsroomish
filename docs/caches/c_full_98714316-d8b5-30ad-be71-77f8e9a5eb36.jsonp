Some other crypto-currency fell even up to 80%. We are intuitively knowing that bitcoin is worth to invest at the current price range than when it is at around $16,000 or $20,000. But how exactly do we know it is at its bottom? No we don't, unless we are big whales who manipulate the price of crypto-currency market. However there some few simple calculations out there to calculate is it reasonable to invest in crypto-currency now.

Sets Its Sights on Decentralization in 2018","summary":"In 2015, Bitcoin developers Jake Yocom-Piatt and David Collins were getting frustrated with Bitcoin. The way they saw it, although Bitcoin started off as a decentralized system, over time, miners and a select group of developers had gained too much control over the protocol. In an attempt to create a system with a more open governance structure, the two launched Decred (short for \u201cdecentralized credit\u201d) on February 8, 2016.\u00a0\u00a0Decred is based on an alternative implementation of bitcoin called btcd, written in Google\u2019s programming language Go. The project\u2019s core ideas stem from a white paper titled \u201cMemcoin2: A Hybrid Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake Cryptocurrency.\u201d Similar to Bitcoin, Decred has a 21 million supply cap. But unlike Bitcoin, 1.68 million (8 percent) of Decred\u2019s coins were pre-mined. Of those, half went to pay developers who contributed to the project early on, while the other half was airdropped (given out for free) to ensure a wide distribution in the network.In Decred\u2019s consensus system, proof of stake works alongside proof of work to give coin holders more of a voice in the system. Anyone who owns decred can buy tickets to participate in the protocol. The price of tickets (currently around $8,000) fluctuates based on demand to ensure that around 41,000 tickets are active in the network at any given time. When you buy a ticket (a process known as \u201cstaking\u201d) your coins are temporarily locked up for several months. When a new block is created, five tickets are chosen at random to verify the block and vote on outstanding issues. As an incentive to participate, voters get 6 percent of the block reward.Now headed into its third year, Decred recently released its 12-month roadmap. Bitcoin Magazine spoke with project lead Yocom-Piatt to get a sense of the highlights of the roadmap.Autonomous TreasuryDecred\u2019s most important project, by far, is its treasury system. Last year, Decred applied voting to unactivated consensus changes in the daemon. Similar to how soft forks get activated in Bitcoin, stakeholders in Decred vote by flipping a version bit in a block header. Once a majority threshold is reached, the new code activates automatically. \u00a0Now, Decred wants to completely decentralize the control of its development funds. (Other projects are working toward similar goals, but if Decred pulls this off, it could be among the first to fully disintermediate the handling of treasury funds.)As it stands, 10 percent of Decred block rewards go into a development fund to create a consistent cash flow for the project. Right now, control of the funds (currently valued at $28 million) is in the hands of the Decred Holdings Group LLC. Plans are to pass control of those funds to the community via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a type of smart contract that requires stakeholders to approve all spending. \u00a0How it works is, anyone in the community will be able to submit a development proposal for a small fee. Ticket holders can then vote on the proposals they want to fund. Once a proposal is approved, users can create their own decentralized autonomous entity (DAEs) to govern the release of those funds.\u201cFor most practical purposes, you can consider a DAO and a DAE to be identical in function,\u201d Yocom-Piatt explained. \u201cFor Decred, there will be the project-level Decred DAO, which is effectively a government entity whose actions are dictated by the stakeholders, and then individual users can form their own DAEs, similar to how you or I could form a C-corporation or LLC here in the U.S. to start a business.\u201dBoth the DAO and DAEs will exist on-chain, but proposal submission and voting will take place off-chain in a version-control system dubbed \u201cPoliteia,\u201d which is anchored to the blockchain via timestamps. This means nobody can surreptitiously modify a proposal.\u201cEvery hour, there is an anchor dropped into the Decred blockchain that allows you to basically say [that] all the information that is in this Git repository existed on or before a given date,\u201d said Yocom-Piatt. \u201cIt is like a time-ordered version of Github that you cannot fake.\u201dWork on Politeia is nearly done, says Yocom-Piatt. Decred just needs to add a voting element before deploying the platform on the mainnet. He thinks Decred could have the DAO up and running by the end of 2018, but DAEs may not happen until 2019. Both types of smart contracts will be written in Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language (remember, Decred is a fork of Bitcoin) but will require extensions in the form of new opcodes. Decentralized ExchangeIn another ambitious undertaking, Decred is looking to remove trusted third-parties from the process of moving funds in and out of Decred. This way, someone holding, say, bitcoin, can trade their bitcoin for decred directly, without going through an external exchange. Key to this idea is the atomic swap, smart contracts that authorize cross-chain trades based on whether participants can publish a hash preimage. Decred completed the first on-chain atomic swap between Decred and Litecoin in October 2017. The next step is to create a decentralized exchange that is distinct from the majority of its peers. \u201cEveryone else who has used [atomic swaps] to date, has done so in an attempt to capture a fee on the swaps, either as an explicit fee or via an intermediate blockchain or a token that is used to coordinate the swap,\u201d Yocom-Piatt said. In contrast, Decred wants to implement atomic swaps in a way that captures no revenue, so that, eventually, other exchanges are no longer needed. \u201cThis isn't about finding a way to compete with other exchanges for trading fees; it is about eliminating them,\u201d he said. \u00a0Decred\u2019s goal in 2018 is to come up with a formal proposal for a decentralized exchange and put the proposal on Politeia for stakeholder approval. \u00a0Consumer-Oriented ApproachOn-chain transactions on Decred take five minutes on average to settle (they take 10 minutes on Bitcoin), which is awkward at best when you want to pay for something on the spot. Decred is planning to implement the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution that allows transactions to be handled instantly off-chain and settled on-chain later, so that users can initiate transactions on the fly. (Lightning is also a central component in enabling atomic swaps.)Specifically, Decred is implementing lnd, the open-source lightning daemon spearheaded by Lightning Labs. The bulk of the work in porting lnd from Bitcoin is nearly complete, says Yocom-Piatt. He adds that the work has been challenging. That is because Lightning was built with Segregated Witness, and, even though Decred is a fork of Bitcoin, Decred still lacks many of the changes that were bundled into Bitcoin\u2019s Segregated Witness changeset. \u201cThere are some outstanding issues with transaction signatures that still need to be sorted out, at which point testing can begin,\u201d he said.Some instant transactions, like point-of-sale, are particularly useful if you make them with your mobile phone, similar to Apple Pay. To that end, Decred is looking to add simplified payment verification (SPV) support to its wallet, so that mobile clients only need to download a small part of the blockchain to verify transactions.But Decred wants to implement SPV in a way that preserves privacy. Right now, many light wallets do not support SPV and instead rely on a central server for checking balance and transaction details. To do this efficiently, the server needs access to your public key, meaning the service can see all of the addresses you use. Meanwhile, most existing SPV clients rely on bloom filters to receive only the transactions relevant to a user\u2019s local wallet. The problem is bloom filters leak information about their users to all the nodes they connect with. To step around this issue, Decred is using a new light-client protocol by Lightning Labs known as compact filters, which offer most of the benefits of a centralized light wallet, without the negative privacy aspects of bloom filters. \u00a0\u201cIt drastically reduces the amount of data you need to download to have a functional client,\u201d said Yocom-Piatt. \u201cIt is just the headers and some filters, basically 66 MB vs 2.1 GB for entire chain.\u201d He said SPV support should be available to users in the spring. Undisclosed Privacy PlansIn Bitcoin, transactions are traceable. In 2018, Decred wants to introduce a proposal for a unique privacy feature that will allow users to send untraceable payments. Decred remains tight-lipped on the matter, other than to say it will take a different approach than Monero and Zcash. Yocom-Piatt\u2019s final comment on the matter: \u201cWe are going to deliver something working as opposed to just declaring what our plans are.\u201d Also on the to-do list, Decred plans to make several scaling improvements to its protocol and it will be updating the graphical user interface (GUI) on its Decrediton wallet to support SPV, mobile, Politeia voting and the Lightning Network. \u00a0\u00a0While many cryptocurrency projects are viewed mainly as a store of value, Decred is steering itself toward a future as a functional payment system, and it wants to be among the first to get there. \u201cOur goal for 2018 is to cut the head off the snake, so nobody can cut the head off the snake later,\u201d Yocom-Piatt concluded.

The report further indicates that the use would be to develop and operate a cryptocurrency mining facility. \u201cPort Executive Director Patrick Reay said his agency has been working with Ant Creek LLC for about six months on the development of a blockchain facility.\u201d\u201cOur purpose is to generate assessed value and create jobs,\u201d Reay stated. The Ant Creek proposal looks to bring up to 20 jobs and $10 million in private investment to the city.Some areas are concerned about the power consumption of crypto mining, such as Plattsburgh, New York, where they are considering banning mining, while other areas such as Quebec, Canada, are welcoming it. Reay said the Port of Walla Walla doesn\u2019t share Plattsburgh\u2019s concern over electricity. \u201cThe Port of Walla Walla, as a municipal entity, is not in the electrical business, as we do not sell electrical service,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe have two electrical providers in Walla Walla County, Columbia REA and Pacific Power.\u201d This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine.","published_at":1520958398,"content_id":"8783de34-ca57-365e-afe9-46e4a430e610","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/bitmain-explores-more-sites-bitcoin-162638354.html","content_published_at":1520958398,"content_time":1520958398,"content_relative_time":74,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":74,"comment_relative_time":74,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fa901c9d-95dc-3435-b037-e8198b2a1bdd","post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-32504090-490b-39b9-9fb2-4ce963685f6a_a-fa901c9d-95dc-3435-b037-e8198b2a1bdd","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-32504090-490b-39b9-9fb2-4ce963685f6a_a-fa901c9d-95dc-3435-b037-e8198b2a1bdd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-32504090-490b-39b9-9fb2-4ce963685f6a_a-fa901c9d-95dc-3435-b037-e8198b2a1bdd","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Bitcoin Magazine","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/york-legislator-proposes-bitlicense-alternative-192631990.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EDdLCVpbiRhn0S6.9iVTXg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/bitcoin_magazine_673\/0c4802d7434427eede6f4ab1c8d853e9","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O9oPcGgOHBnowVpmFnDCLg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NDQ7dz04MDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/bitcoin_magazine_673\/0c4802d7434427eede6f4ab1c8d853e9","height":444,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/bitcoin_magazine_673\/0c4802d7434427eede6f4ab1c8d853e9","imgw":800,"imgh":444,"title":"New York Legislator Proposes BitLicense Alternative for Cryptocurrency Users","summary":"New York State Assembly legislator Ron Kim (D-40) has unveiled a bill that intends to protect cryptocurrency investors and ease the bureaucratic burden on crypto-related businesses. It\u2019s the first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill in New York to make it past studies and commissions and into the hands of the legislative branch. Kim introduced the legislation on March 13, 2018, after he met with blockchain industry leaders on the subject.Known as The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act (A9899), the bill relates to \u201cthe audit of cryptocurrency business activity by third party depositories and prohibits licensing fees to conduct such cryptocurrency business activity.\u201dIf it were to take effect, the legislation would make amendments to Section 9 of New York\u2019s Banking Law. With the addition of section 9-x, the law would mandate that any cryptocurrency business or entity be subject to routine audits by a public or third-party depository service. These audits would require that individuals and businesses alike safeguard assets with proper security measures, provide adequate insurance for account holder assets and produce proof-of-asset ownership. Any entity in full compliance will receive a digital New York Seal of Approval to reassure consumers that the outlet is trustworthy and secure. This seal would ideally replace the BitLicenses currently issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services, doing away with this fee-based license in favor of one earned by audit. Kim believes that earlier efforts to regulate the space have put enormous burdens on businesses trying to grow and operate in the cryptocurrency space. \u201cWhat New York needs now,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201care common-sense laws and security procedures to provide a degree of clarity for both businesses and the public. This legislation will give consumers and companies the confidence needed for widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in New York.\u201dWhile the bill is the first of its kind for New York legislators, this isn\u2019t Kim\u2019s first foray into cryptocurrency. As a precursor to the landmark legislation, Kim recently published a brief report titled \u201cThe Future of Bitcoin in NY.\u201d His research identifies unregulated exchanges as \u201cthe weak point\u201d in the blockchain ecosystem. This vulnerability, coupled with the cost of a BitLicense, has left New York lacking in legitimate crypto-companies and consumer confidence.According to a statement from Kim\u2019s office, there are currently fewer than 10 BitLicense holders in the entire state of New York, even though there are some 1,000 active job postings in New York for the blockchain industry. It\u2019s Kim\u2019s hope that the new legislation will foster a friendlier environment for companies in the space; one that will attract more business and generate increased revenue by connecting consumers with reliable, state-vetted entities.Throughout 2017, the United States government remained relatively quiet on the subject of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. While other countries are beginning to outline clear regulations and legislative guidelines, U.S. investors have had their ears filled with conflicting talk from the SEC, the CFTC and various state legislatures. So far, however, it\u2019s been a busy year for the United State\u2019s regulatory efforts, both on federal and state levels, and The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act is yet another installment in a growing series of litigation that finally broaches the topic of cryptocurrency regulations. If anything, the legislation may set a precedent for consumer protections in the industry, as well as a more lenient regulatory approach that might encourage job growth in the industry.

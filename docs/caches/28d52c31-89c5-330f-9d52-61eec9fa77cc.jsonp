McKinley and later expounded on by space journalist James C. Bennett, is back in fashion. Last week, tech journalist Ramin Skibba wrote an op-ed for The Hill where he analogised some of the challenges of 21st century space exploration to those faced in the maritime environment.\u00a0[1]\u00a0Skibba wrote that the United States is \u201cin dire need of a single national organisation dedicated to authorising and regulating activities in orbit and beyond.\u201d\u00a0[2] If we are to apply the maritime analogy to space governance as Skibba suggests, it only makes sense to look to the US Coast Guard as a model for that agency.

Unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, depending on your point of view \u2014 the large chunk of twisted metal found sitting silently amongst the foliage has a much more mundane explanation. First discovered by a pair of Chinese power plant workers traveling to their job, the object did indeed come from space, but it was made right here on Earth. The large metal cone was actually the nosecone fairing from a recent Chinese rocket launch, according to the country's space agency. The country sent its Long March 4C rocket skyward on May 20th to deliver a communication satellite into orbit. The launch, which was conducted at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in the Sichuan province, went just fine, but apparently space agency officials lost track of where the rocket's nosecone was going to land. The spot where it crashed down is largely woodland, but it's not terribly far from some populated villages. In fact, the officials investigating the UFO-turned-space-junk recruited some villagers to help carry and store the fairing for \"safekeeping.\" Authorities eventually transported the nosecone back to the launch center by people who are actually paid to handle that sort of thing. The launch of the relay satellite was part of China's newfound ambitions for exploring the Moon. The country plans to launch and land a probe and rover on the dark side of the Moon, which would be a first for humanity. The date of that launch is still up in the air, but the current timeline sees the country completing its goals by the end of 2018. Let's hope no more space junk falls on any Chinese villages in the process.","published_at":1527612333,"content_id":"547ded58-0854-31f2-a739-2ac6e75d6d81","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/chinese-ufo-found-crashed-forest-turns-space-trash-164141862.html","content_published_at":1527612101,"content_time":1527612101,"content_relative_time":52,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-5858e237-41e9-3d8d-8e10-cdece7f7dab8_a-b654e432-9478-39a8-bee0-eed9817f186d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/5-things-differently-space-4s93ptd","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"MNN - Mother Nature Network","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.mnn.com\/earth-matters\/space\/stories\/5-things-you-have-differently-space","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CO922sghLAK3r8wQKXq0sA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yDEMP5YCytaWeYj7RyAJxg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b654e432-9478-39a8-bee0-eed9817f186d-903456239.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ADmzEL5UNN7fP2IPPsJTxg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yDEMP5YCytaWeYj7RyAJxg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b654e432-9478-39a8-bee0-eed9817f186d-903456239.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yDEMP5YCytaWeYj7RyAJxg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b654e432-9478-39a8-bee0-eed9817f186d-903456239.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"5 things you have to do differently in space","summary":"Our exploration of space is full of wonder \u2014 but it's also subject to the ordinary minutia of day-to-day living.

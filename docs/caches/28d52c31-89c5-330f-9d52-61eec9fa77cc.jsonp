A superluminous supernovae is a rare class of core collapse supernovae whose luminosity, equal to 10-1000 billion suns, is too high to be powered by the usual process that drives supernovae, the radioactive decay of nickel (there is not enough nickel present to do it). Long-duration gamma-ray bursts are those that last for a few seconds up to several minutes, unlike the more common gamma-ray bursts that last for under a few seconds. The long-duration bursts are suspected of being sustained by the rotational energy of a spinning compact object left behind from a supernova.","published_at":1523626577,"content_id":"34018418-57c4-3d47-ac64-5f9f0d12e926","content_url":"https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/new-model-supports-connection-between-gamma-ray-bursts-and-supernovae\/","content_published_at":1523595600,"content_time":1523595600,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-60eb2208-ed63-30f2-9000-0ac6c48e61f4_a-0dfb48bc-a6df-326c-8068-56a6ee4b3dfa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/nasa-may-extend-space-station-wfhvhrk","author":"nanook","provider":"SpaceNews.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/spacenews.com\/nasa-may-extend-space-station-missions-to-address-potential-commercial-crew-delays\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EUNYqbNyJN8.84ruuV7GhQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1R4FKhpjbSxJ4LYysplnMw--\/dz04Nzk7aD00ODU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0dfb48bc-a6df-326c-8068-56a6ee4b3dfa-1748817163.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zLr23kXvlMonrpaRu1IV5A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00ODU7dz04Nzk7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1R4FKhpjbSxJ4LYysplnMw--\/dz04Nzk7aD00ODU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0dfb48bc-a6df-326c-8068-56a6ee4b3dfa-1748817163.jpeg","height":485,"width":879,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1R4FKhpjbSxJ4LYysplnMw--\/dz04Nzk7aD00ODU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0dfb48bc-a6df-326c-8068-56a6ee4b3dfa-1748817163.jpeg","imgw":879,"imgh":485,"title":"NASA may extend space station missions to address potential commercial crew delays","summary":"NASA is in discussions with its Russian counterparts about extending some upcoming space station missions as a way to buy more time for development of commercial crew vehicles.

The European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft has gifted us with a fresh look at a mysterious crater called Ismenia Patera. The big question for scientists is whether Ismenia Patera is an impact crater or the remnants of a supervolcano. \"Patera\" comes from the Latin for a shallow or flat bowl, an apt description for the formation that measures about 47 miles (75 kilometers) across. ESA shared several different looks at the crater, including a sideways perspective that helps the features pop.

In 1958, he was hired to work at a new observatory in West Virginia and wondered, Could this telescope detect signals from other civilizations? Luckily, the man running the observatory shared Drake's curiosity about (or belief in) extraterrestrial life and gave the go-ahead to his strange endeavor. That was Project Ozma, named for the queen of L. Frank Baum's Oz. It lasted four months, with six hours of listening per day targeting two specific stars\u200a\u2014\u200aTau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani\u200a\u2014\u200aeach about 11 light-years away.

Instead, Voyager found a world alive with volcanoes.

In addition to being the closest extra-solar planet to our Solar System, this terrestrial planet also orbits within Proxima Centauri's circumstellar habitable zone (aka. \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d). As a result, scientists have naturally sought to determine if this planet could actually be home to extra-terrestial life. Many of these studies have been focused on whether or not Proxima b could retain an atmosphere and liquid water on its surface in light of the fact that it orbits an M-type (red dwarf) star.

As of today, we have no proof that there are, in fact, time travelers among us. All the time travelers we know are from the silver screen. What we do have today are theories about how time travel may be possible and how it would work. 10 Einstein's Theory Of General Relativity The first theory on this list is Einstein's theory of general relativity.[1] This theory helped physicists theorize about how time travel could exist.

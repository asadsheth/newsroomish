Marshall helped to develop the rockets that carried the first U.S. astronaut into space and those that delivered humans to the moon. Today, the agency is working on the Space Launch System that could one day carry astronauts to Mars. Shortly before opening the new agency, NASA described the Marshall Center as \"the only self-contained organization in the nation which was capable of conducting the development of a space vehicle from the conception of the idea through production of hardware, testing, and launching operations.\" In addition to developing space vehicles,","published_at":1516672633,"content_id":"206882a0-c7c7-38ba-ae31-b59ae1ce6bb7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/39463-marshall-space-flight-center.html","content_published_at":1516671780,"content_time":1516671780,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-17e6c7dd-7d43-30c9-a7be-6b224e6d6afe_a-902e0fb0-af17-3adf-a3af-e3159be8a251","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/black-holes-firing-triple-threat-4hyoavv","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"newscientist.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/2159109-black-holes-are-firing-a-triple-threat-of-speedy-particles-at-us\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Black holes are firing a triple-threat of speedy particles at us","summary":"Three of the strangest sorts of particles that we can detect on Earth may all come from the same place. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays, high-energy neutrinos, and powerful gamma rays could all be born in the chaos of a black-hole jet. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays come from space and have energies millions of times higher than anything we can produce in an accelerator on Earth. They were first discovered in 1962, and since then no one has been able to figure out for sure where they originate. The same is true for neutrinos and gamma rays with extremely high energies.

While it is a fairly large constellation, its stars are faint \u2014 none are brighter than fourth magnitude \u2014 making it challenging to see in the sky with the naked eye. Pisces is notable for containing the point at which the sun crosses the celestial equator into the Northern Hemisphere around March 20 each year. This point, called the vernal equinox, used to lie in Aries, but has moved into Pisces because of the Earth's wobble on its axis, called precession, according to astronomer and author Ian Ridpath.

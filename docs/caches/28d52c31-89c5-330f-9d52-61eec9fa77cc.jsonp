Theorists are constantly exploring other options; individual galaxies and their satellites arguably favor some modification of gravity to dark matter; there are big controversies over just how fast the Universe is expanding, and the conclusions we've drawn from supernova data may need to be altered. Given that we've made mistaken assumptions in the past by presuming that the unseen Universe contained substances that simply weren't there, from the aether to phlogiston, isn't it a greater leap-of-faith to assume that 95% of the Universe is some invisible, unseen form of energy than it is to assume there's just a flaw in the law of gravity? The answer is a resounding, absolute no, according to almost all astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists who study the Universe.","published_at":1524063939,"content_id":"d008d400-ca2b-3e49-b5e6-40d76a9cdc92","content_url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/starts-with-a-bang\/what-astronomers-wish-everyone-knew-about-dark-matter-and-dark-energy-d13eada60ea0","content_published_at":1523973661,"content_time":1523973661,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-c28b36d7-50db-369c-84ae-737dc0ae0c43_a-f741c370-df5a-3c2b-aa0d-56a404422a6c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/space-communications-stuck-dial-age-jc2pm3u","author":"third_watch","provider":"FiveThirtyEight","provider_url":"http:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/economics\/","provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/space-communications-are-stuck-in-the-dial-up-age-which-means-its-time-for-more-lasers\/?yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YrZ1fB.SHsPRNpqPzW57lg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/fivethirtyeight.com\/5ec8aaf4a19a63724de9455e6a8612d9","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3cGnJ3f4q.SurLwabsl9fA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD05MDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/fivethirtyeight.com\/5ec8aaf4a19a63724de9455e6a8612d9","height":900,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/fivethirtyeight.com\/5ec8aaf4a19a63724de9455e6a8612d9","imgw":1200,"imgh":900,"title":"Space Communications Are Stuck In The Dial-Up Age.

Researchers from Switzerland, France and Germany examined diamonds found inside the Almahata Sitta meteorite and concluded they were most likely formed by a proto-planet at least 4\u00bd billion years ago. The diamonds in the meteorite, which crashed in Sudan's Nubian Desert in October 2008, have tiny crystals inside them that would have required great pressure to form, said one of the study's co-authors, Philippe Gillet. \u201cWe demonstrate that these large diamonds cannot be the result of a shock but rather","published_at":1523980953,"content_id":"d076edb6-1343-309d-9434-5fcd9e579957","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/04\/17\/study-diamond-from-the-sky-may-have-come-from-lost-planet\/","content_published_at":1523980710,"content_time":1523980710,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-0aa5a44e-a7c4-3115-a7a9-c8ff2d96b706_a-14e61b27-597e-3110-bb9f-4e6d8cfa940b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/nasas-orion-spacecraft-contains-more-2uz7ahz","author":"nanook","provider":"TechCrunch","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/17\/nasa-orion-spacecraft-contains-more-than-100-3d-printed-parts\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"NASA's Orion spacecraft contains more than 100 3D-printed parts","summary":"The parts, the company is quick to explain, are more than just prototyping.

The US space agency has announced it's going ahead with plans to develop an aircraft that can break the sound barrier -- but quietly. Which means that unlike it's sonic boom-producing predecessors, including Concorde, it could operate commercial routes over land. NASA has awarded Lockheed Martin a $247.5 million contract to build the supersonic aircraft. It wants the aerospace company to refine, build and test the experimental aircraft -- known as the X-plane or \"Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator\" -- and deliver it to NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center by the end of 2021.

The refined distance yardstick provides an independent estimate for the age of the universe. It will also help astronomers improve models of stellar evolution. Star clusters are the key ingredient in stellar models because the stars in each grouping are at the same distance, have the same age, and have the same chemical composition.

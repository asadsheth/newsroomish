Some alien planets in multiple-star systems \u2014 such as the two-sun Tatooine, Luke's home world in the \"Star Wars\" universe \u2014 may indeed nestle in orbits that are stable for long stretches of time, a new study suggests. In the study, researchers ran more than 45,000 computer simulations, examining where planets of various masses and dimensions could exist in two- and three-star systems. Planets have been discovered in such systems, but just how long they can remain in their orbits before gravitational interactions send them crashing into one of their host stars, or careening out into interstellar space, remains a topic of considerable debate.","published_at":1528197653,"content_id":"31aca6c8-6fdc-3d27-a004-b34724d9797c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.space.com\/40791-alien-planets-stable-multiple-star-systems.html","content_published_at":1528197000,"content_time":1528197000,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-9c8f9eea-6eec-36e1-996f-8e19f4a1225c_a-162642fc-587d-38cb-a06c-450b341b454a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/spacex-says-won-t-send-1wg4jn8","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Digital Trends","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-01-26\/978dac00-e411-11e6-a2f8-bfcbd13a5054_dt_logo_46x46.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/spacex-says-won-t-send-073547102.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XS5ieOVyb9WQmQR44wlZlQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/b1b28d00f4feba2d7ceb910070f7388f","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4fGY2JcJEKSJiC4vSrMQlQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/b1b28d00f4feba2d7ceb910070f7388f","height":2667,"width":4000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/b1b28d00f4feba2d7ceb910070f7388f","imgw":4000,"imgh":2667,"title":"SpaceX says it won\u2019t send space tourists around the moon just yet","summary":"SpaceX said in 2017 that it planned to send two high-paying space tourists on a trip around the moon by the end of this year.

The telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, was initially expected to launch in 2007 but has faced repeated delays and burgeoning costs. The launch date most recently was delayed to May 2020, which will likely push project costs over the $8 billion cap set by Congress in 2011. The mission has been so problematic that a 10-member, Independent Review Board was tasked with reviewing it.

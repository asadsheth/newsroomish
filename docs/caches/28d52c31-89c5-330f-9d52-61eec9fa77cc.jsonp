Now new research led by Durham University, UK, and Australia's University of Sydney, Western Sydney University and the University of Western Australia, has shown that life could potentially be common throughout the Multiverse, if it exists. The key to this, the researchers say, is dark energy, a mysterious \"force\" that is accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Scientists say that current theories of the origin of the Universe predict much more dark energy in our Universe than is observed.

Astronauts Charlie Camarda and Paolo Nespoli were mission specialists on different Space Shuttle Discovery flights. In 2005, Camarda was part of STS-114, the first shuttle mission to fly after the tragic Columbia accident that caused the deaths of seven astronauts. In 2007, Nespoli crewed the STS-120 Discovery flight, and returned to space two more times for Expeditions 26\/27 and 52\/53 on the International Space Station. Last month, both astronauts landed here at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, their alma mater, to explain to a new generation of innovators what it's like to fly in space.

Without gravity, seeds can float away. Water doesn't pour, but globs up and may drown the roots. And artificial lights and fans must be rigged just right to replicate the sun and wind. But NASA has decided that gardening in space will be crucial for the next generation of explorers, who need to feed themselves on missions to the Moon or Mars that may last months or years. Necessary nutrients such as vitamins C and K break down over time in freeze-dried foods. Without them, astronauts are increasingly vulnerable to infections, poor blood clotting, cancer and heart disease.

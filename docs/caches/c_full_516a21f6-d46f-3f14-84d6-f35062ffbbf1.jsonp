As Democrats try to develop strategies for the midterm and 2020 elections, they face a thorny dilemma: How do they woo those mostly white swing voters back while also energizing black voters, whose turnout in 2016 fell back to 2004 levels after surging to new record highs for Obama's two elections? Evidence has emerged in some studies that \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d about changes that had left them behind may have had less to do with Trump voters' choices than anxiety about other, more complex social changes that seemed to be slipping beyond the voters' control. Instead of economic hardship, University of Pennsylvania political scientist Diana Mutz writes in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, after analyzing data from 2012 and 2016, \u201cit was about dominant groups that felt threatened by change and a candidate who took advantage of that trend.\u201d For those voters, Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d theme called up visions of a comforting past, whether it ever actually existed or not.","published_at":1526426141,"content_id":"07783feb-db0b-307c-818e-419032b52607","content_url":"http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/opinion\/page\/ct-perspec-page-kanye-west-donald-trump-stanley-greenberg-20180515-story.html","content_published_at":1526420400,"content_time":1526420400,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Kanye West","vibe_id":"516a21f6-d46f-3f14-84d6-f35062ffbbf1","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":3,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854","post_id":"v-516a21f6-d46f-3f14-84d6-f35062ffbbf1_c-7153e1e0-0f95-3e5a-a3cf-b01aa27732ef_a-9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-516a21f6-d46f-3f14-84d6-f35062ffbbf1_c-7153e1e0-0f95-3e5a-a3cf-b01aa27732ef_a-9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/kanye-west\/romeo-langford-shares-prowess-fortnite-5gawqw2","author":"nanook","provider":"Indianapolis Star","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.indystar.com\/story\/news\/2018\/05\/14\/iu-recruit-romeo-langford-probably-beat-you-fortnite-kanye-west-twitter-high-school-sports\/606841002\/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=indystar\/todaystopstories","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gdlH02BMhBiAMU5vcYvPaA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GraSc9d2bJbvmrbVRPOpbQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854--1485180699.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cc.DttP.DWZqX.DzLoI4WA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GraSc9d2bJbvmrbVRPOpbQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854--1485180699.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GraSc9d2bJbvmrbVRPOpbQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854--1485180699.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"Romeo Langford shares prowess on 'Fortnite' and Mr. Football dishes on Kanye West","summary":"IndyStar's Justin Mack caught up with the (then un-announced) IU recruit on the red carpet prior to the April 29 Indiana Sports Awards.

Arguably, Ty Dollar $ign \u2013 more croaky and strained than ever \u2013 isn't really needed here, and the video is a bit much (Xtina lapping milk out of a glass with her tongue is more \u201cGeorge Galloway on Celebrity Big Brother\u201d than \u201csex kitten\u201d).

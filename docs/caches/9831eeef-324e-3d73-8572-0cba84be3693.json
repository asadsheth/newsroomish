Under normal -- many may say abnormal -- circumstances, however, it takes about 16 to 17 hours. A cricketer has to start his preparations from the wee hours of the morning and even if he starts his journey at 5:00 am, there is no guarantee that he will reach the venue before the start of the match at 9.30 am. But don't be too alarmed about the morning odyssey, because what awaits him in the evening is nothing short of a horror story. Starting at 6:00 pm after the end of the match, he may even need three hours to travel three kilometres and then reach home at midnight.

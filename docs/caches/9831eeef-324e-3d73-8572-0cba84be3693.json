That performance earned O'Brien 440 rankings points. To find a performance that earned a batsman more rankings points in a team's debut Test, we must go all the way back to 1877 and the first ever Test match, in which the opener Charles Bannerman made 165 retired hurt out of Australia's first-innings total of 245 against England at the MCG.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) are not convinced by the day-night format, and doubt its place in the future of the game. We've been here before. In the early 1980s, India had no time for the new craze that was one-day cricket. Officials scorned Kerry Packer's cricket circus, and even the players \u2013 using Sunil Gavaskar's defiant 36 off 174 in the 1975 World Cup as their rallying","published_at":1526414733,"content_id":"559509a0-8421-3964-9d51-5a4bfa6e9786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2018\/may\/16\/indias-reluctance-to-play-pink-ball-test-no-historical-surprise","content_published_at":1526407227,"content_time":1526407227,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-b42425c3-42eb-34dd-b081-c027c62aafb5_a-1bb2e0c3-619e-3155-b059-4bef13bba5bb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/jos-buttler-dom-bess-selections-4ri703j","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"ESPNcricinfo","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23512760\/jos-buttler-dom-bess-selections-more-numbers-ed-smith","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FJ5_I3llJPedahbPGnIDVg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpZ8uwqk2Mz2.xS.fovaYg--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1bb2e0c3-619e-3155-b059-4bef13bba5bb--1979282340.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jVlqYfHX0OGw1Yd_pBM83g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Mjk7dz0xMjk2Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpZ8uwqk2Mz2.xS.fovaYg--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1bb2e0c3-619e-3155-b059-4bef13bba5bb--1979282340.jpeg","height":729,"width":1296,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DpZ8uwqk2Mz2.xS.fovaYg--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1bb2e0c3-619e-3155-b059-4bef13bba5bb--1979282340.jpeg","imgw":1296,"imgh":729,"title":"Jos Buttler and Dom Bess selections about more than the numbers for Ed Smith","summary":"George Dobell After all the talk of analytics, Ed Smith simply went with a hunch in selecting his first Test squad.

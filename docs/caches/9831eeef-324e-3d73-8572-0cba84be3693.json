Wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Shahzad (40 off 37) entertained the Dehradun crowd which turned up in huge numbers to watch the first ever international game in the state. The enthusiasm amongst the fans was palpable with many walking as much as three kilometers to enter the 25,000 capacity stadium which was surrounded by a heavy security cover. There were some teething troubles at the venue which otherwise looked spick and span. The wicket played slow as expected but Shahzad picked his spots well to bludgeon five boundaries.

Jaques was left as the only candidate for the role after his former Australia team-mate Brad Haddin withdrew from the running late last week, with the imminent commencement of the national team's limited-overs tour of England and Zimbabwe believed to be a contributing factor to his decision. Haddin is contracted with the national side as an assistant coach until the end of next year's Ashes tour. Having previously served as the head coach of Queensland, Jaques moved back to Sydney last year for family reasons and served as an assistant to Trent Johnston as the NSW Blues endured a season of underwhelming results.","published_at":1527824263,"content_id":"f4609bb1-27b8-311e-9fba-dd4719b38507","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23636662\/phil-jaques-commissioned-restore-nsw","content_published_at":1527573555,"content_time":1527573555,"content_relative_time":156,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-908197ae-7598-30ae-889d-f5557f470d3a_a-5b953101-4b4f-394a-be9b-f112836d327f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/spin-bowler-arjun-nair-cleared-illegal-deliveries-2vq6tok","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Associated Press","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.ap.org\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/04\/21\/image001-png_162613.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/spin-bowler-arjun-nair-cleared-illegal-deliveries-004919811.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Spin bowler Arjun Nair cleared of illegal deliveries","summary":"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Cricket Australia says spinner Arjun Nair has been cleared to resume all bowing after his ban due to an illegal action was lifted.","published_at":1527814278,"content_id":"5b953101-4b4f-394a-be9b-f112836d327f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/spin-bowler-arjun-nair-cleared-illegal-deliveries-004919811.html","content_published_at":1527814159,"content_time":1527814159,"content_relative_time":89,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-efa0f952-eaaf-37a4-bad0-57912e1f2032_a-aa3475ab-9e5f-3393-9c3b-adb839a5b6df","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/indias-umpires-receive-higher-match-4lfnvlw","author":"third_watch","provider":"ESPNcricinfo","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23656611\/india-umpires-paid-more-domestic-players","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pwY68FOl4rVN_2Sp8E.1Vw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gHs7IS.2yAOzlVthrYeuQA--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_aa3475ab-9e5f-3393-9c3b-adb839a5b6df-649907245.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NUpsiISXOzGbzAv0qzXXHg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NTA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gHs7IS.2yAOzlVthrYeuQA--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_aa3475ab-9e5f-3393-9c3b-adb839a5b6df-649907245.jpeg","height":450,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gHs7IS.2yAOzlVthrYeuQA--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_aa3475ab-9e5f-3393-9c3b-adb839a5b6df-649907245.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":450,"title":"India's umpires to receive higher match fees than domestic players","summary":"ESPNcricinfo staff The top 20 umpires in India will earn more money for a day's work than domestic cricketers according to a revised pay structure that was approved by the BCCI's Committee of Administrators in April.

They have been thin on the ground over the past two years - including in this winter's 4-0 Ashes defeat.","published_at":1521468169,"content_id":"d937669a-bfc2-3978-9326-3a52e6d4578d","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sport\/cricket\/article-5517239\/England-bowler-Stuart-Broad-ready-damage-New-Zealand.html","content_published_at":1521455287,"content_time":1521455287,"content_relative_time":58,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-0a538d9b-597d-3008-87ea-3ca9efcb9c78_a-9cd46f96-a80d-3ff2-85c0-b1f304c1bcf5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-0a538d9b-597d-3008-87ea-3ca9efcb9c78_a-9cd46f96-a80d-3ff2-85c0-b1f304c1bcf5","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sabbir-drives-bangladesh-166-8-t20-tri-series-164957837--spt.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/S9f_rhwgycsDV5WtIvU_bA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/2ecd707a37b50496f716a35f53ce6704c887a989.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.v2UnJj0tz1n6oMbCNaUmw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03NDY7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/2ecd707a37b50496f716a35f53ce6704c887a989.jpg","height":746,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/2ecd707a37b50496f716a35f53ce6704c887a989.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":746,"title":"Sabbir drives Bangladesh to 166-8 in T20 tri-series final","summary":"Batsman Sabbir Rahman scored a gritty half-century to help Bangladesh post 166 for eight against India in the Twenty20 tri-series final in Colombo on Sunday.","published_at":1521464058,"content_id":"9cd46f96-a80d-3ff2-85c0-b1f304c1bcf5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sabbir-drives-bangladesh-166-8-t20-tri-series-164957837--spt.html","content_published_at":1521391797,"content_time":1521391797,"content_relative_time":75,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-19100341-ad4c-3661-b15b-82235a193548_a-de7d0366-2e3d-36ea-9054-b71e48c618cb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/cricket-bancroft-confident-starc-recovery-third-test-115648751--spt-48iy6lb","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cricket-bancroft-confident-starc-recovery-third-test-115648751--spt.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Cricket-Bancroft confident of Starc recovery for third test","summary":"Australia opening batsman Cameron Bancroft is unsure what to expect from the Newlands pitch for the third test against South Africa starting on Thursday but he is expecting Mitchell Starc to overcome a sore calf in time to play.

Pietersen, 37, who briefly captained England in 2008-09, spent the latter part of his career playing for a number of club teams across the world after controversially being told in 2014 that he was no longer in the national side's plans. A hard-hitting batsman who often made playing unorthodox shots look easy, Pietersen was part of England's 2005 Ashes-winning side and helped them win the 2010 World T20 title.

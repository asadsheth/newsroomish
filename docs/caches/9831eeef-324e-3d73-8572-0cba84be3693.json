The Pretoria wicket is likely to be similar, with perhaps not the same sideways movement of Newlands, and will provide another test of the Indian batsmen's bravery against a seam bowling barrage.","published_at":1515673719,"content_id":"35dfa98b-e81c-3671-a1c6-5229a0cba7db","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cricket-no-reprieve-india-second-test-pretoria-122747437--spt.html","content_published_at":1515673667,"content_time":1515673667,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-c3fac536-afa4-39da-8c9d-e983c205df84_a-25b3ca4a-8c92-362b-b1b6-6bce342cfdc5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/rahuls-first-visit-amethi-party-46zj1a0","author":"nanook","provider":"Business Standard","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/wap.business-standard.com\/article-amp\/news-ians\/rahul-s-first-visit-to-amethi-as-party-chief-next-week-118011001083_1.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c6jGY6kW7cRrOSDDHuL2MQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JXCf5DgbB0BM8a9Omx_FiA--\/dz02OTY7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_25b3ca4a-8c92-362b-b1b6-6bce342cfdc5-2071833329.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WMeg2yUoYH_pHdhD0o1npQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjA7dz02OTY7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JXCf5DgbB0BM8a9Omx_FiA--\/dz02OTY7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_25b3ca4a-8c92-362b-b1b6-6bce342cfdc5-2071833329.jpeg","height":420,"width":696,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JXCf5DgbB0BM8a9Omx_FiA--\/dz02OTY7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_25b3ca4a-8c92-362b-b1b6-6bce342cfdc5-2071833329.jpeg","imgw":696,"imgh":420,"title":"Rahuls first visit to Amethi as party chief next week","summary":"Congress President Rahul Gandhi will visit his Lok Sabha constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh on January 15 and 16 for the first time after taking over as the party chief.

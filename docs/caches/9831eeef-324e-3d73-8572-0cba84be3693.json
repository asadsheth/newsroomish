Even better, he became a national symbol at a time when cricket was the national sport. In the summer of 1947, with Britain still wheezing from the cost of the war, he gave the people something to cheer about, scoring 3,816 runs, hitting 18 hundreds and forging a partnership with his Middlesex and England team-mate Bill Edrich that still trips off cricket lovers' tongues.

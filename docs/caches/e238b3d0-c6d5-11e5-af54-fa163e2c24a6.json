The Blazers and the Raptors have two players that are capable of coming up big during crunch time and can also represent the team as the face of the franchise. You can always count on a duo on almost every team -- even in the era of superteams where three or four stars are team up to take over the league by storm.

It's true, Brewer led the Thunder in scoring with 22 points in their 121-113 win to complete a three-game season sweep over the LA Clippers on Friday, even making the two biggest plays of the game: a corner 3 with 1:44 left to put OKC up 10, and a steal with 26 seconds remaining after the Clippers had cut the lead to six. The impact Brewer has made since joining the Thunder is real, and it's been shockingly spectacular, with them going 5-0 since he was inserted into the starting lineup.","published_at":1521262447,"content_id":"846a5e28-f2b6-35d2-a5bf-92476689b770","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/nba\/story\/_\/id\/22802028\/oklahoma-city-thunder-sweep-la-clippers","content_published_at":1521265371,"content_time":1521265371,"content_relative_time":86,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-b2a57570-6479-3c66-8478-0abae37ef443_a-1761bba3-a5c4-3ad7-8c82-18cddf62a94f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-b2a57570-6479-3c66-8478-0abae37ef443_a-1761bba3-a5c4-3ad7-8c82-18cddf62a94f","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Daily News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2018\/03\/16\/isaiah-thomas-final-shot-comes-up-short-as-heat-edge-lakers\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IXhSDQFnWfVtOjJe6tJf5A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nhJlyv8HLjRUuRQHtocu.Q--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzAzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1761bba3-a5c4-3ad7-8c82-18cddf62a94f-602164744.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ejmvp85Ogi45vGcKpbcP6g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MDM7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nhJlyv8HLjRUuRQHtocu.Q--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzAzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1761bba3-a5c4-3ad7-8c82-18cddf62a94f-602164744.jpeg","height":703,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nhJlyv8HLjRUuRQHtocu.Q--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzAzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1761bba3-a5c4-3ad7-8c82-18cddf62a94f-602164744.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":703,"title":"Isaiah Thomas' final shot comes up short as Heat edge Lakers","summary":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 The directive out of the final timeout was simple: Get the ball to Julius Randle.

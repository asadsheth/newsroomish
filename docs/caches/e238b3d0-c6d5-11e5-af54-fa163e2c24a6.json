The Los Angeles Lakers point guard had an abysmal start to his rookie season, shooting a lowly 24 percent from 3-point land in November. But Ball has been brilliant since returning from a knee injury that sidelined him for 15 games before the NBA All-Star break. In the four games since returning from the knee sprain, Ball is shooting 63.3 percent from long distance and is averaging 12 points, 7.2 assists and 6.7 rebounds per game. He has shot 59.4 percent from downtown in his last nine games.

Ingram isn't a superstar yet, and he may never be, but regardless of what one thinks of his game, it's almost inarguable that he has the best natural tools of any members of the Lakers' current young core. Likewise, the ceilings for other members of the Lakers' young core also appear pretty clear, because we've seen players like them. Kyle Kuzma is probably going to be a very good scoring forward, while Josh Hart is a three-and-D guy with maybe a little more off-the-dribble skill than most of that

Presided over by legendary patriarch Red Auerbach, the Celtics captured 11 championships in 13 years (1957-69), including a streak of eight straight (1959-66). With Bill Russell blocking shots and triggering their high-octane offense, they ran rings around the competition and established the gold standard for NBA dynasties. Defining the elements of a dynasty in the modern era is a more difficult task for a number of reasons, among them the fluidity of rosters, size of the league (now 30 teams instead of eight), importance of salary cap management and financial burden of escalating player salaries.","published_at":1527681825,"content_id":"71f5edd7-7463-30e2-9ff3-e606203100ee","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/05\/30\/destination-dynasty-would-title-no-3-solidify-warriors-place-in-the-club\/","content_published_at":1527681643,"content_time":1527681643,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-48a84f45-9886-3b18-a070-17cbcadd5bd2_a-926d733b-1726-31fa-b96e-3be62e9a7871","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-48a84f45-9886-3b18-a070-17cbcadd5bd2_a-926d733b-1726-31fa-b96e-3be62e9a7871","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"FiveThirtyEight","provider_url":"http:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/economics\/","provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/why-kevin-durants-shoes-keep-falling-off\/?yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RUpR2CMAnH7AnB1IaCos_Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/fivethirtyeight.com\/f8c80b3bd473c8e3e6c22f3e352bc26a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b7RrYme.U4Z2wFIiStVP0A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNTA7dz0yMDQ4Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/fivethirtyeight.com\/f8c80b3bd473c8e3e6c22f3e352bc26a","height":250,"width":2048,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/fivethirtyeight.com\/f8c80b3bd473c8e3e6c22f3e352bc26a","imgw":2048,"imgh":250,"title":"Why Kevin Durant\u2019s Shoes Keep Falling Off","summary":"IT\u2019S DEC. 6 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a sold-out crowd files into the Spectrum Center.

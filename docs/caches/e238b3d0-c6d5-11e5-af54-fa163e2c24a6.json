We're right on Houston's heels. It's a very tight race right now. So we got to take the lead.\u201d The Warriors promptly took the lead and said that Thompson's words did not reflect team policy. \u201cKlay said something, but we're focused on ourselves,\u201d Warriors","published_at":1520118918,"content_id":"d90c31f2-5478-3e59-b530-b030fb494fe1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/03\/03\/steve-kerr-to-prioritize-health-building-habits-over-home-court-advantage\/","content_published_at":1520122884,"content_time":1520122884,"content_relative_time":44,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-64d41375-0882-3d3a-908c-c0aafa245719_a-be2ef842-929c-3b25-9a78-dfef235ba112","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/clippers-danilo-gallinari-another-couple-64vqvex","author":"nanook","provider":"NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/clippers-danilo-gallinari-another-couple-230012713.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7v5YmA7zjNvEvbNJFpeNUA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nbcsports.com\/6a59fd496b991a991f6dd7b103493b5b","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SJL9vVQ8JpU2oz52WUfE9A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDc7dz01NDU7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nbcsports.com\/6a59fd496b991a991f6dd7b103493b5b","height":307,"width":545,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nbcsports.com\/6a59fd496b991a991f6dd7b103493b5b","imgw":545,"imgh":307,"title":"Clippers\u2019 Danilo Gallinari out another couple of weeks with fractured hand","summary":"Danilo Gallinari has played in 19 games for the Clippers this season and sat 42 with injuries.","published_at":1520118253,"content_id":"be2ef842-929c-3b25-9a78-dfef235ba112","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/clippers-danilo-gallinari-another-couple-230012713.html","content_published_at":1520118012,"content_time":1520118012,"content_relative_time":46,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-59c5f3a8-2f54-3af6-9c1e-f834d2c7cc21_a-55e8e8e3-b07a-343e-b9ef-f5e8b99faa9e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/brad-stevens-gordon-haywards-recovery-1q6buiq","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.sportingnews.com\/nba\/news\/gordon-hayward-injury-update-celtics-rockets-brad-stevens-nba-not-playing-this-year\/1s06smjq6h4cp1qqgo4quhp418","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H_W8YAxAV49slJc8w7OUBA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.1clRZgwVoYlYDUAlsBf7g--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTA4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55e8e8e3-b07a-343e-b9ef-f5e8b99faa9e--1249124517.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/FAXccnGFlCzdooSXfEwruQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.1clRZgwVoYlYDUAlsBf7g--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTA4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55e8e8e3-b07a-343e-b9ef-f5e8b99faa9e--1249124517.jpeg","height":1080,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.1clRZgwVoYlYDUAlsBf7g--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTA4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_55e8e8e3-b07a-343e-b9ef-f5e8b99faa9e--1249124517.jpeg","imgw":1920,"imgh":1080,"title":"Brad Stevens on Gordon Hayward's recovery: 'He's not playing this year'","summary":"Gordon Hayward ignited a mini firestorm Friday when he released a video on The Players Tribune of his current rehab program from the fractured ankle he suffered in the Celtics' season-opening loss to the Cavaliers.

He came off a fantastic season in Boston, was traded upon the hip injury and only had 15 games to try and get back to form in Cleveland. He was then traded to the Lakers before the trade deadline. The Lakers seem to have their focus on the young core and attracting superstars in the 2018 or 2019 free agency market. There was a rumor going around during Kawhi Leonard's absence that he was unhappy with the Spurs inability to attract superstar talent. Whether that was true or not, who knows but it seems to not be since Kawhi is coming back. I am not insinuating that Isaiah is a superstar pre-injury.

could tell the NBA commissioner all about the fine art of tanking","summary":"NBA commissioner Adam Silver put on his bad cop hat this week, fining Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban $600,000 for speaking the plain truth and admonishing the Association's 30 franchises that tanking \u201chas no place in our game.\u201d Commissioners are so cute when they're sanctimonious. The subject came up when Cuban said during a podcast that he told his players \u201closing is our best option.\u201d Why? Because the worse your record, the better chance you have of getting the first pick in the draft. Mind you, there is no evidence that the Mavs are throwing games, and plenty of evidence that they are simply a collection of mediocre players. It hasn't always been that clear cut.

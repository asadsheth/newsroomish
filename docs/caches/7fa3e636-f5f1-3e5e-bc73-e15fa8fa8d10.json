An added bonus for those who care about going zero to 60 in the shortest amount of time is that electric cars are veritable jackrabbits. Electric cars are more expensive than gas-powered ones, but their prices are dropping quickly, thanks to technological advances and generous tax incentives.","published_at":1523798009,"content_id":"c1a455a7-b215-3170-91de-18757d8beb2d","content_url":"http:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/opinion\/letters\/2018\/04\/14\/the-road-ahead-fuel-efficiency\/SmZc8lC7zxlEgSt0zcLEmI\/story.html","content_published_at":1523779200,"content_time":1523779200,"content_relative_time":36,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-67c24165-0bb0-3fcc-bf6e-3cec79eeeaae_a-7f870314-0e42-3647-8668-abc18be8575a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/car-68-shelby-gt350-h-1h0io07","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Mercury News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/04\/15\/me-my-car-68-shelby-gt350-h-rent-a-racer-beautifully-restored\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O2B11pOT9B4hUTogyYSW7A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OceeRESXNeiSChAAfPBeOQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9Njg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7f870314-0e42-3647-8668-abc18be8575a--1977070404.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MnjSAlG9CJXvi5EYU.r8Qg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODg7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OceeRESXNeiSChAAfPBeOQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9Njg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7f870314-0e42-3647-8668-abc18be8575a--1977070404.jpeg","height":688,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OceeRESXNeiSChAAfPBeOQ--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9Njg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7f870314-0e42-3647-8668-abc18be8575a--1977070404.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":688,"title":"Me & My Car: '68 Shelby GT350-H 'Rent-a-Racer' beautifully restored","summary":"We all know at least a little about the Ford Mustang.

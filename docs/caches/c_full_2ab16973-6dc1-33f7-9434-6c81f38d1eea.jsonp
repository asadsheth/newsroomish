The broadcaster has been making programmes for 75 years, starting in black-and-white, moving on to HD and now in truly immersive video. Now the 91-year-old, who once claimed he would never retire from filming, can live on eternally through a simulation. \u201cIt's as exciting now as it was then. I started in 1952, which was a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cTelevision was just coming from Alexandra Palace and two little studios; neither of them was as big as this room we're in now. It was only on the air for a few hours a day, and you couldn\u2019t see it unless you lived in London, and it was like a little club.\u201d But now those who\u00a0fancy a sit-down with Sir David can do so using their smartphone, provided they\u00a0have the\u00a0Sky VR app and a headset. Despite the museum sitting \"just down the road\" from Sir David's home, the 91-year-old was flown\u00a0to California where he was\u00a0filmed by more than 100 cameras and recreated as a 3D hologram tour guide throughout London\u2019s Natural History Museum, by graphics studio Factory 49. App users can interact with rare specimens from the museum\u2019s world-famous collection, including the one animal Sir David said he would most like to bring back from extinction: \u00a0the Anhanguera, a species of pterosaur. Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA \u201cWe have its jaw, which is all we know of it, really,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an extraordinary pterosaur which we know little about, and which we\u2019re making all the deductions about. \u00a0 \u201cWhen you pick it up with the VR there is my voice saying, \u201cLook at that tooth. What do you think that means? How would this have been used?\u201d and so on. \u00a0 \u201cAnd you focus on a different part of the jaw and my voice tells you different things about it. \u00a0You can go on speculating about that, and I would love to see what the proper answer was, and maybe we will know for sure one day, maybe we won\u2019t.\u201d","published_at":1528445109,"content_id":"6d91c6d6-4bbd-3146-8108-92141fbb54de","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/watch-sir-david-attenborough-meet-075835497.html","content_published_at":1528444715,"content_time":1528444715,"content_relative_time":81,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":81,"comment_relative_time":81,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"caa2970c-73fc-3031-8600-37912f21e9df","post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-ee42dfe6-c2cd-3dfe-8f03-867ec67c9756_a-caa2970c-73fc-3031-8600-37912f21e9df","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-ee42dfe6-c2cd-3dfe-8f03-867ec67c9756_a-caa2970c-73fc-3031-8600-37912f21e9df","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/miamis-vr-expo-set-showcase-2yq29e3","author":"nanook","provider":"Miami, FL Patch","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/patch.com\/florida\/miami\/miamis-vr-expo-set-showcase-all-things-virtual","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GSgy_p3aIofWYzQ2ahFKmw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/p5O7k4YnccNj0YHzU8PDeg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_caa2970c-73fc-3031-8600-37912f21e9df--422921210.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4UsmXekAEAOxQNrRKGZmqw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MDA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/p5O7k4YnccNj0YHzU8PDeg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_caa2970c-73fc-3031-8600-37912f21e9df--422921210.jpeg","height":600,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/p5O7k4YnccNj0YHzU8PDeg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_caa2970c-73fc-3031-8600-37912f21e9df--422921210.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":600,"title":"Miami's VR Expo Set to Showcase all things Virtual","summary":"Miami, FL \u2014 If you believe in the magic of tech, get ready to experience one of the most innovative conferences featuring emerging technology.

Located in the heart of San Francisco's emerging nano-satellite industry, SpaceVR developed the world's first virtual reality camera satellite, betting on creating a market for cinematic, live, virtual space tourism. When I met him at the Pioneers tech conference in Vienna, Austria, in May, Holmes was rocking the quasi-guru look \u2013 dressed in loose-fitting robes adorned with large fresh red roses \u2013 and he talked passionately about using virtual reality to expand people's consciousness. \u201cSpaceVR aims to give everyone the opportunity to experience the truly infinite, boundless Universe through virtual reality,\u201d he explained in quietly earnest tones, which were somewhat disconcerting to a cynical old tech journalist.","published_at":1528299499,"content_id":"cdf4abd1-5087-3e3f-aa6c-6d9fc10a15fb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicebonasio\/2018\/06\/06\/the-startup-that-wants-to-use-virtual-reality-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-from-space\/","content_published_at":1528261200,"content_time":1528261200,"content_relative_time":132,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":132,"comment_relative_time":132,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

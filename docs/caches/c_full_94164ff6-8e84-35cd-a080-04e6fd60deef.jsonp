Following the unfortunate, filmed and wrongful arrest of two black patrons, Rashon\u00a0 Nelson and Donte Robinson, in an all-too-familiar scene at a Starbucks store in Philadelphia, the company has perhaps disproportionately decided to shut 8,000 of its U.S. establishments on May 29 for\u00a0racial bias training.","published_at":1524469792,"content_id":"dc35db06-93b6-3379-87b9-c3a5117fb4b2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/dantedisparte\/2018\/04\/22\/starbucks-i-take-my-coffee-black\/","content_published_at":1524459600,"content_time":1524459600,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Starbucks","vibe_id":"94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":14,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed","post_id":"v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-8d523f6e-52d3-340c-b648-32bd8a65fa57_a-6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-8d523f6e-52d3-340c-b648-32bd8a65fa57_a-6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/starbucks-1490333697\/monday-memo-earnings-alaska-air-4it4ecs","author":"nanook","provider":"The Seattle Times","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/business\/monday-memo-earnings-from-alaska-air-boeing-amazon-starbucks-and-microsoft-plus-seattle-area-home-prices-and-2-ipos\/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sEGUUrwprgFTU5oaBoVkiQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w6rZtpXsFQKiKeGnBUFqow--\/dz03ODA7aD01MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed--1426429366.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mG42jTLXuXGCxX2nspMz4Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MDE7dz03ODA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w6rZtpXsFQKiKeGnBUFqow--\/dz03ODA7aD01MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed--1426429366.jpeg","height":501,"width":780,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w6rZtpXsFQKiKeGnBUFqow--\/dz03ODA7aD01MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed--1426429366.jpeg","imgw":780,"imgh":501,"title":"Monday Memo: Earnings from Alaska Air, Boeing, Amazon, Starbucks and Microsoft, plus Seattle-area home prices and 2 IPOs","summary":"SOMETIME THIS WEEK: Two Washington companies are expected to go public this week: Bellevue-based Smartsheet, which makes project tracking and workflow software, and Vancouver-based nLight, a maker of semiconductor and fiber lasers for industrial companies.

I know that many white people will instinctively and emphatically resist that observation. They'll note the self-evident truth that prejudice is confined to no one culture or color. Having known more than a few African-American bigots, homophobes and anti-Semites, I'll be happy to concede the point. But racism is more than prejudice. It is, rather, the system by which prejudice is encoded into the laws and customs of a society so that, to take an example not quite at random, two black men can be arrested for waiting quietly on a prospective business associate to arrive for a meeting at Starbucks. People of color have no access to the system that allows that.

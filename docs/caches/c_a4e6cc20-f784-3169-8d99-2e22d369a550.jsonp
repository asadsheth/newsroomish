bat with rabies found near San Jose's Willow Glen ball field","summary":"A dead bat found on Memorial Day near the baseball field at Willow Street's Frank Branhall Park in San Jose has tested positive for rabies, setting off an alert for anyone who might have come in contact with the bat or other bats to seek immediate medical attention. Rabies can be deadly, and it must be treated quickly after exposure for treatment to be successful. A fast-acting shot helps neutralize the disease and prevent a victim from developing rabies. The injection is then followed by four more shots over two weeks. Britt Ehrhardt, public health communicator with the Santa Clara County Health Department, said there is no indication that humans were exposed to the bat.

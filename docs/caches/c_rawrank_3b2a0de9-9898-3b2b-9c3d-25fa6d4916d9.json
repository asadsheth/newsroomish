He was surrendered by his previous owner due to a move and is having trouble getting over losing his people. He thinks he's as fierce as a mountain lion and likes to try and occasionally imitate their roars to keep the staff at Routt County Humane Society on their toes as they clean. He was an indoor cat, but staff think he could be an excellent mouser. Re-bonding with a new owner will take time as he is selective with who he opens up to. But once he accepts you as his people and new pride, it will be a truly special bond and you will be the center of his world.

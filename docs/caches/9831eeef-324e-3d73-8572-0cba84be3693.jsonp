In scary scenes on Sunday, Pucovski was rocked by a short ball from NSW fast bowler Sean Abbott and fell to his knees after taking a blow to his helmet when he was on four runs in the Vics second innings. Abbott, who bowled the bouncer that struck Phillip Hughes at the SCG in November 2014 and tragically led to the batsman's death, was also shaken and raced down to Pucovski who was quickly surrounded by players and officials. Pucovski, who made his maiden first class century with 188 against Queensland at the MCG last month, was subbed out of the game, replacd by Dan Christian, and will be sent for more tests.","published_at":1520137960,"content_id":"1ad6b380-b362-365d-acb5-8f3d6a089927","content_url":"http:\/\/at.foxsports.com.au\/link\/6ec4c15099e071ed7d97b63b1836b016","content_published_at":1520145360,"content_time":1520145360,"content_relative_time":64,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-1e339b08-bc62-3a8b-81dc-b2eec340be94_a-64847db5-dc91-3258-bbed-e5c97c0552eb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/primary-skill-pandya-needs-improve-106pujf","author":"third_watch","provider":"Business Standard","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/wap.business-standard.com\/article-amp\/pti-stories\/as-his-primary-skill-pandya-needs-to-improve-his-batting-kapil-118030100870_1.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eppwlnziTWZpM0H92DGRxA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BJyEXdQ5pfDkKKqp.WI1GQ--\/dz02OTY7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_888e4a98-ca0f-3bc1-8cf2-324266739510-2071833329.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kydg2e9rf0t.6FOhkZblKg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjA7dz02OTY7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BJyEXdQ5pfDkKKqp.WI1GQ--\/dz02OTY7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_888e4a98-ca0f-3bc1-8cf2-324266739510-2071833329.jpeg","height":420,"width":696,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BJyEXdQ5pfDkKKqp.WI1GQ--\/dz02OTY7aD00MjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_888e4a98-ca0f-3bc1-8cf2-324266739510-2071833329.jpeg","imgw":696,"imgh":420,"title":"As his primary skill, Pandya needs to improve his batting: Kapil","summary":"Former India captain Kapil Dev wants Hardik Pandya to \"work harder on his batting\" as that is his primary skill as an all-rounder.

Every single Test match since the very first, between Australia and England at the MCG in March 1877, has begun with a toss of the coin to decide who should bat or bowl first. The home captain flips the coin and the visiting captain calls heads or tails. The proposed remedy is to abandon the coin toss for matches played as part of the Test Championship, to commence with Australia's Ashes tour of England in 2019, leaving the visiting side to elect whether to bat or bowl first.","published_at":1526534592,"content_id":"92b45608-d76b-307c-bf04-b75d4e6cd2fb","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23525914\/to-toss-not-toss?-icc-scrap-tradition","content_published_at":1526537032,"content_time":1526537032,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-67ab42ef-509a-3c6f-bf4c-424af1c21ac5_a-5dce72ce-4e93-3850-be0a-d82aea51a53f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/mark-waugh-slams-selfish-india-over-day-night-011922720--spt-341ya1v","author":"nanook","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/mark-waugh-slams-selfish-india-over-day-night-011922720--spt.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_rhvo3Vg4AqYyuafWCwWAA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/31856d13207713a1e42818958f9f201a7b7612dd.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V72at121oEd4nkLfO7FlqQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/31856d13207713a1e42818958f9f201a7b7612dd.jpg","height":722,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/31856d13207713a1e42818958f9f201a7b7612dd.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":722,"title":"Mark Waugh slams 'selfish' India over day-night Test snub","summary":"Retiring selector Mark Waugh has lashed out at \"selfish\" India for refusing to play a day-night Test during their tour of Australia, accusing the cricketing power of holding back the game.

In the 1930s, county cricket clubs in England were headed for financial ruin after a succession of wet summers. Twenty years later, persistent rain saw desperate clubs experiment with blankets, rubber mats and suction pumps. As recently as the summer of 2012, three of England's 13 One Day International events were abandoned due to rain, while no result was possible in two of their seven Test matches with West Indies and South Africa. That's why the sport must take notice of a report published by Climate Coalition, the UK's largest climate change action group, in February.

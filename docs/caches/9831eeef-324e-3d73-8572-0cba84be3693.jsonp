Nottinghamshire gained the upper hand early, reducing Yorkshire to 93 for five before lunch on day one, only to lose their grip. After an encouraging opening 45 minutes on day two, the visitors slipped from 100 for four to 130 for eight in reply to 256 against accurate bowling from Ben Coad and Tim Bresnan, who shared the wickets equally, and some excellent slip catching. The new-ball seamer Coad finished with four wickets in Nottinghamshire's 188 all out, a total reached only after some meaty tail-end hitting from Jake Ball.","published_at":1524357451,"content_id":"cc32696d-6b1a-3ae6-82ed-2e76525fe506","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2018\/apr\/21\/gary-ballance-yorkshire-nottinghamshire","content_published_at":1524343953,"content_time":1524343953,"content_relative_time":48,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-25a7ef4d-cb19-352d-ae08-727245bcbac2_a-8a6bdc62-bc98-3ed8-b45b-6c6c3401542e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/central-zone-manage-draw-against-20oi9vw","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"thedailystar.net","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.thedailystar.net\/node\/1565293","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xpiByzbnF9Rz9t4DqgqzyA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sApDp01bxRPlPeC4GHjh1Q--\/dz01NjA7aD0yOTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8a6bdc62-bc98-3ed8-b45b-6c6c3401542e-1907902183.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YmlCdgCXMQt7V9DR3OvheA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yOTI7dz01NjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sApDp01bxRPlPeC4GHjh1Q--\/dz01NjA7aD0yOTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8a6bdc62-bc98-3ed8-b45b-6c6c3401542e-1907902183.jpeg","height":292,"width":560,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sApDp01bxRPlPeC4GHjh1Q--\/dz01NjA7aD0yOTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8a6bdc62-bc98-3ed8-b45b-6c6c3401542e-1907902183.jpeg","imgw":560,"imgh":292,"title":"Central Zone manage draw against South","summary":"South Zone declared at 484 for the loss of eight wickets against Central Zone as Mossaddek Hossain struck ton on the last day but Central Zone manage to hold on to a draw losing five wickets on the fourth and final day of the Bangladesh Cricket League match at Rajshahi.

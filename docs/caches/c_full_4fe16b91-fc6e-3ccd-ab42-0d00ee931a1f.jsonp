A survey of 3,000 people by the Ponemon Institute, a US think tank, reported by the Financial Times, showed that users were significantly more skeptical than they were last year that Facebook would handle their personal information with care. In fact, the graph below suggests confidence in Facebook's data handling had been trending up since 2015. The findings support Business Insider Intelligence's 2018 Digital Trust survey, which found that 81% of Facebook users have little to no confidence in the company to protect their data and privacy. These fears were considerably more pronounced for Facebook than they were for Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube.","published_at":1523957900,"content_id":"18b8c937-9ac5-32f7-8dfd-0bdb54e07015","content_url":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/facebook-trust-collapses-after-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal-2018-4","content_published_at":1523941200,"content_time":1523941200,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Facebook","vibe_id":"4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":13,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"262541e3-5a6f-31b2-be98-faa73d8a629c","post_id":"v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-9278b243-9bd6-3fbd-a61b-a85676c3ca32_a-262541e3-5a6f-31b2-be98-faa73d8a629c","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-9278b243-9bd6-3fbd-a61b-a85676c3ca32_a-262541e3-5a6f-31b2-be98-faa73d8a629c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/facebook\/v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-9278b243-9bd6-3fbd-a61b-a85676c3ca32_a-262541e3-5a6f-31b2-be98-faa73d8a629c","author":"nanook","provider":"Storyful","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.storyful.com","provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/moose-loose-spotted-near-fort-010646262.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/s7iReqizPikWq1N5iNyFUw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.storyful.com\/b9ec8c6abcb2861d655d7c27eff0683f","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zLwgBBEkokacqns7acwDuQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMDI4Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.storyful.com\/b9ec8c6abcb2861d655d7c27eff0683f","height":720,"width":1028,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.storyful.com\/b9ec8c6abcb2861d655d7c27eff0683f","imgw":1028,"imgh":720,"title":"Moose on the Loose Spotted Near Fort Kent, Michigan","summary":null,"published_at":1523927270,"content_id":"262541e3-5a6f-31b2-be98-faa73d8a629c","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/moose-loose-spotted-near-fort-010646262.html","content_published_at":1523927206,"content_time":1523927206,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Facebook","vibe_id":"4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f","content_type":"video_link","aspect":0.560000000000000053290705182007513940334320068359375},"created_at":0,"comment_time":17,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2e8db1c5-b1e9-37c4-a78f-e1555831a9fc","post_id":"v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-98a0f916-8f92-321c-abba-9cf42b0928b6_a-2e8db1c5-b1e9-37c4-a78f-e1555831a9fc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-4fe16b91-fc6e-3ccd-ab42-0d00ee931a1f_c-98a0f916-8f92-321c-abba-9cf42b0928b6_a-2e8db1c5-b1e9-37c4-a78f-e1555831a9fc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/facebook\/facebook-probably-tracking-whether-not-50ocg3z","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Business Insider","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-12-22\/4956c420-c82f-11e6-80cc-6beda8319ce8_BI.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/facebook-probably-tracking-whether-not-015525638.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IZ_BzBz3KMAHvGb660nU3A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/businessinsider.com\/4f5d664f8f257116bceb5699ad3c974f","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NrBlKx0S0YWRFk_TtJPxew--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/businessinsider.com\/4f5d664f8f257116bceb5699ad3c974f","height":1333,"width":2000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/businessinsider.com\/4f5d664f8f257116bceb5699ad3c974f","imgw":2000,"imgh":1333,"title":"Facebook is probably tracking you whether you use it or not \u2014 and it doesn't really give you a choice (FB)","summary":"Facebook collects data on non-users and logged out users alike, a company representative acknowledged Monday in a blog post.

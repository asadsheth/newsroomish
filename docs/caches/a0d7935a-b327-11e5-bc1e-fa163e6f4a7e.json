The current program has put about 50,000 low-income residents on private insurance plans, but it will expire later this year if lawmakers don't reauthorize it. The Senate earlier this month voted in favor of a bill to continue the program for five years but change its structure to a managed care model. The plan also would impose new work requirements on enrollees and use 5 percent of liquor revenues to cover the state's cost as federal funding decreases.

Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took away the sometimes hefty up-front cost of long-acting, reversible contraceptives such as implants and intra-uterine devices, more women have been choosing them to prevent pregnancy. Privately insured women have also been using more birth control overall since the ACA contraceptive coverage mandate went into effect in 2013. The mandate requires most private health insurance plans to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods without cost-sharing.

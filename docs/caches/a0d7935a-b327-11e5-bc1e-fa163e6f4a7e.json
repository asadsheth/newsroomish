Ralph Northam is set to introduce a new budget for next month's special session. Northam will discuss his proposal at a meeting Wednesday afternoon. The governor announced last week that he was calling state lawmakers back to work in April after they adjourned the regular 2018 session without passing a state spending plan. The GOP-led General Assembly is split on whether to expand Medicaid to about 300,000 low-income Virginians. The House supports expansion while the Senate does not. It's unclear if there will be an agreement by April 11, when the special session convenes.

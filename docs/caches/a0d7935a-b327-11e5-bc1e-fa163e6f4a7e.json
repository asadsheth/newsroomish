The release coincided with an unsuccessful attempt in the Senate to restore funding for a second set of Obamacare subsidies -- which helped to reduce low-income enrollees' deductibles and co pays -- that President Donald Trump eliminated last fall. \"Despite an initial rough patch in the ACA marketplaces, the ACA Medicaid coverage expansion and subsidies to insurers have resulted in a large increase in health insurer profits,\" the four-page report said.","published_at":1521805704,"content_id":"554289ce-8d85-3e8f-8682-98f53c0c495c","content_url":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/23\/news\/economy\/trump-obamacare-insurers\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29","content_published_at":1521801591,"content_time":1521801591,"content_relative_time":125,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ef12cddc-f00e-3236-a55d-e54819d674eb_a-b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/governor-renews-calls-medicaid-expansion-233w7mj","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"San Francisco Chronicle","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/news\/article\/Northam-to-unveil-special-session-budget-proposal-12769320.php","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/g.QerRkk7jGt4vkskE69Mg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tpOKrMojNA8ULEGo42U5A--\/dz0yMDQ4O2g9MTQ4MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961-114539566.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WlCoLxlpIGTS5eN6fH3HSA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNDgxO3c9MjA0ODs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tpOKrMojNA8ULEGo42U5A--\/dz0yMDQ4O2g9MTQ4MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961-114539566.jpeg","height":1481,"width":2048,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tpOKrMojNA8ULEGo42U5A--\/dz0yMDQ4O2g9MTQ4MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961-114539566.jpeg","imgw":2048,"imgh":1481,"title":"Governor renews calls for Medicaid expansion in Virginia","summary":"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam renewed his call for Medicaid expansion Wednesday as he unveiled the budget he will propose to lawmakers when they return for a special session next month.

I've already learned the season is leaping ahead three years from where the fifth season ended, to a 1987 where American-Soviet relations are thawing ever so slightly, where Gorbachev is working to open up the USSR to the West, where Philip and Elizabeth Jennings (the series' married KGB spy protagonists) have never been further apart.

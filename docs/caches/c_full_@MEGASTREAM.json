Police in North Port, approximately 60 miles south of Tampa, said 32-year-old John Christopher Ludwick was pronounced dead at a local hospital after 7 a.m. Investigators say Ludwick attacked the unidentified woman in her driveway and was stabbed in the ensuing struggle. Authorities said Ludwick and his would-be victim knew each other, but declined to elaborate. Last year, Ludwick claimed that Joran van der Sloot -- the prime suspect in Holloway's disappearance -- paid him $1,500 to dig up her body in 2010, five years after the 18-year-old vanished on the Dutch Caribbean island.","published_at":1521078300,"content_id":"820ea334-1851-3a30-a3ec-ea856f08ae33","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/03\/14\/man-who-claimed-cremated-natalee-holloway-killed-while-attempting-kidnapping-police-say.html","content_published_at":1521078300,"content_time":1521078300,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":96,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":14,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/donald-trump\/v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"POPSUGAR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Trump-Tweet-About-Obama-Staff-Turnover-Rate-44666788","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cdk2qZGBJOBAfGkGC2BlnQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0usQsnybJ0sht0i5FwrcuA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"This Old Trump Tweet Is Coming Back to Haunt Him \u2014 Because, Well, Just Read It","summary":"It's no secret that President Donald Trump isn't the best at keeping officials in his administration around for very long.

But soon after, Affleck more or less went public with his romance with Lindsay Shookus, a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer whom he may have started seeing when he was still married to Garner. But three years after that initial 2015 announcement, Affleck and Garner, both 45, have yet to finalize their divorce, raising the question: What's taking so long? A new report by Us Weekly cites sources who say that the \u201cBatman v. Superman\u201d actor is dragging his feet because he would like to get back together with Garner, with whom he has three children.

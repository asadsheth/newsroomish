Photographer Trevor Cadigan, 26, of Dallas, Texas, took the video of himself and other passengers and posted it to Instagram just minutes before the crash that killed him and four others, with only the pilot surviving. Cadigan was a video journalist who just moved to New York City a few months ago, relatives said. The dead also included two New York City residents \u2014 Tristan Hill, 30, of the sightseeing-tour company Sightsy, and Daniel Thompson, 34, who worked for the helicopter company \u2014 as well as

deGrasse Tyson drops truth bombs on Flat Earthers, and it\u2019s glorious","summary":"Believing that the Earth is flat was an excusable error back in the days before high-powered telescopes and space travel but today? Please. In order to actually believe that the Earth is flat in the modern day, you need to also believe that just about everything else is also fake, including every single observation made by astronomers, every photo of the Earth, and even gravity. Gravity wouldn't work like it does on our planet if Earth were flat, due to the center of mass being in the middle of the disc instead of the center of a sphere, so that's right out the window. You even have to believe that the Moon itself is fake, since lunar eclipses show that the Earth is indeed a sphere. In a new video, Neil deGrasse Tyson addresses all of those facts and more when dispelling the idiotic theory that the Earth is flat, and it's a lovely sight. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hLPPE3_DVCw In the video, Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice run through a brief history of people believing the Earth is flat, noting that it was largely accepted that the Earth is in fact round even as far back as ancient Greece, thanks to observations made by astronomers at the time. The scientist talks about experiments conducted centuries and centuries ago regarding how shadows fall, noting that there's no way a flat Earth could produce the kind of shadows that we can easily observe here on the surface. Honestly, Tyson spends the entire nine minute video citing facts that any normal, sane person already knows, but which will bounce right off the noggins of just about any Flat Earther. Those who have chosen to believe in the flat Earth theory even in the face of thousands of years of scientific observation from every single continent will simply brush it off as \"lies\" anyway because that's just what they do. I mean, if a person is willing to believe that gravity, space, and the Moon are all fake, it's kind of hard to reason with them in the first place. Towards the end of the video, Tyson blames the faltering US education system for the number of Flat Earthers that have sprung up in the country, noting that it's not so much about teaching children long-known facts, but also about teaching them how to effectively reason. It's hard to argue with him there, because if there's one thing Flat Earthers lack it's reason.","published_at":1520878332,"content_id":"eb9907ce-3d74-3453-b02e-0a3cf1c5b83e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/neil-degrasse-tyson-drops-truth-bombs-flat-earthers-181212072.html","content_published_at":1520878332,"content_time":1520878332,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":33,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":3,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b197d869-a8c1-34ef-bf69-39a220b2f47e","post_id":"v-611e8982-b21b-33a7-a66a-e03bcf4392f7_c-b197d869-a8c1-34ef-bf69-39a220b2f47e_a-b197d869-a8c1-34ef-bf69-39a220b2f47e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

Rather than ignore Syd, he responded thoughtfully: \"I believe this message was intended for someone else. You should definitely go with that one!\" To prove that five of his kids really did approve of the navy dress, Tony sent along an adorable photo of his kids giving Syd's ensemble the thumbs

It's the kind of case we talked about back in law school, and I was intrigued enough to dig up the Missouri-based\u00a0court complaint\u00a0to learn more.\u00a0I've included it at the bottom of this story.\u00a0 But I think the most important line in the entire filing is one some people have missed. And buried in the reasoning behind it, is an important lesson for business leaders and entrepreneurs. Here's the line: Plaintiff is requesting damages in the amount of $74,999.99 and nothing more. It's an odd number, right?

More than 200 businessmen, princes and government officials were detained in November and imprisoned at the luxury hotel in Riyadh in what the Saudi government said was an anti-corruption drive.\u00a0 According to the New York Times, some of the powerful detainees may have suffered abuse at the hands of their captors as they were coerced into agreements to hand over billions of dollars to the Saudi government in return for their freedom.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia has dismissed the allegations of abuse as \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d.\u00a0 The most dramatic accusation involves Major General Ali al-Qahtani, an aide to a senior Saudi prince seen as a potential rival to the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed, who died in government custody in mid-December.\u00a0 The report was published shortly before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for meetings with the Trump administration Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ Saudi Royal Palace \/ BANDAR AL-JALOUD Sources told the newspaper that the general\u2019s \u201cneck was twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken\u201d and that his body had burn marks which appeared to be the result of electric shocks.\u00a0 General Qahtani was taken to hospital in November but was reportedly returned to his interrogation after being seen by doctors. The government has not offered an official explanation for how he died.\u00a0 The general\u2019s death had been widely reported in Arab and Iranian media previously but not in detail. The US report comes shortly before Prince Mohammed, known by his initials \u201cMBS\u201d, is due in Washington for meetings with the Trump administration.\u00a0 General Qahtani was an aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh who is from a rival line of the Saudi royal family to Prince Mohammed. Prince Turki was himself detained during the November crackdown on allegations of corruption. He was eventually released.

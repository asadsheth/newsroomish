Peters, who was briefly suspended from the network \u00a0several years ago for calling then President Obama a \"total pussy\" on live TV over his terrorism strategy, used his goodbye letter to take a dig at him one last time while simultaneously bashing Trump and Fox News' hosts. \"As a Russia analyst for many years, it also has appalled me that hosts who made their reputations as super-patriots and who, justifiably, savaged President Obama for his duplicitous folly with Putin, now advance Putin's agenda by making light of Russian penetration of our elections and the Trump campaign,\" Peters wrote.\u00a0 Fox News wasn't just going to let Peters trash talk the network, however, saying he was using his opinion \"as a weapon in order to gain attention.\" NEW - Statement from Fox News on Ralph Peters email: \"Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention.

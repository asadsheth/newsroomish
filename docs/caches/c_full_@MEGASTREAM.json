Police in North Port, approximately 60 miles south of Tampa, said 32-year-old John Christopher Ludwick was pronounced dead at a local hospital after 7 a.m. Investigators say Ludwick attacked the unidentified woman in her driveway and was stabbed in the ensuing struggle. Authorities said Ludwick and his would-be victim knew each other, but declined to elaborate. Last year, Ludwick claimed that Joran van der Sloot -- the prime suspect in Holloway's disappearance -- paid him $1,500 to dig up her body in 2010, five years after the 18-year-old vanished on the Dutch Caribbean island.","published_at":1521078300,"content_id":"820ea334-1851-3a30-a3ec-ea856f08ae33","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/03\/14\/man-who-claimed-cremated-natalee-holloway-killed-while-attempting-kidnapping-police-say.html","content_published_at":1521078300,"content_time":1521078300,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":92,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":14,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/donald-trump\/v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004_a-2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"POPSUGAR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Trump-Tweet-About-Obama-Staff-Turnover-Rate-44666788","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cdk2qZGBJOBAfGkGC2BlnQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0usQsnybJ0sht0i5FwrcuA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Za8_WpKPvsYb_YPZ1SV4vg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2da57b7d-aa6e-39ba-977d-bbed5a15b004-1145408101.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"This Old Trump Tweet Is Coming Back to Haunt Him \u2014 Because, Well, Just Read It","summary":"It's no secret that President Donald Trump isn't the best at keeping officials in his administration around for very long.

This will no doubt be one of the most important days of both of their lives\u00a0\u2013 yet, while it marks the first day of her marriage to the prince, it will not be the first time Meghan Markle has walked down the aisle. The former Suits actress was previously married to Trevor Engelson, a 41 year-old movie producer from\u00a0Great Neck, New York. Their marriage reportedly ended abruptly\u00a0and he is currently working on a pilot episode about an ex marrying a royal \u2013 but what else do we know about him? Who is Trevor Engelson? Mr Engelson\u00a0was born on the north shore of Long Island,\u00a0New York on October 23, 1976.\u00a0He is currently a film producer and talent manager in Los Angeles after getting his start in the movie industry\u00a0as a production assistant. Engelson produced\u00a0License to Wed, starring Robin Williams, and 2009's\u00a0All About Steve; but he is perhaps most well known\u00a0for producing\u00a0Remember Me, a 2010\u00a0tearjerker starring Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin. Meghan Markle had a cameo role in the film, playing a character called Megan. As boss of \u00a0Underground Management, Engelson also manages screenwriters, actors, novelists, and film directors. Engelson's marriage to Ms Markle Meghan was 23 years-old when she met her ex-husband. They reportedly started dating back in 2004, marrying\u00a0after seven years together. Engelson married the Suits actress on September 10 2011 at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.\u00a0The wedding was a four-day affair and took place in front of 102 guests. Meghan landed her role in Suits just a few months before they married. However\u00a0sustaining a long-distance marriage was apparently too difficult for the couple; Ms\u00a0Markle and Engelson separated after two years. Their divorce was finalised in August 2013, with the couple citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Engelson has not spoken about\u00a0his ex-wife's new relationship but Ms\u00a0Markle's half-brother Thomas Markle Jnr. blamed their divorce\u00a0on 'the pressure of Hollywood'. Days until the Royal wedding One source told Woman's Day magazine that it was her job filming the Suits and the resulting the long-distance\u00a0situation that ultimately ruined their\u00a0relationship. The insider said:\u00a0\"They really battled with long distances. Trevor was based in LA while Meghan was in Toronto, a five-hour flight away.\u00a0It was a very difficult way to start married life.\" In his controversial new book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, Royal biographer Andrew Morton revealed that Ms. Markle returned \u00a0her wedding and engagement rings to Engelson by registered post\u00a0after ending their marriage \u201cout of the blue\u201d. \u201c[Engelson] went from cherishing Meghan to, as one friend observed, \u2018Feeling like he was a piece of something stuck to the bottom of her shoe\u2019,\u201d Morton wrote. \u201cWhether she wanted to admit it to herself or not, Meghan, who once said she couldn\u2019t imagine life without Trevor by her side, was now building a new world for herself.\u201d Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features grid Engelson's latest project? A divorce-themed Royal rom-com Engelson's most recent project has been an\u00a0upcoming television remake of Heathers based on the 1988 film of the same name. Yet the movie trade website\u00a0Deadline Hollywood\u00a0announced in September 2017 that Fox was\u00a0developing a pilot with Engelson for a story that centres around the story of man whose wife leaves him for a British prince. This was the pitch: \"Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London\u2019s tabloid media, is next level.\" The pair did not have children together\u00a0and the lead characters of the proposed new series\u00a0are not based on their lives. However\u00a0Deadline did say\u00a0the comedy's idea originated after Trevor had a conversation with fellow producer Dan about what might have happened had he shared custody of children with the Royal Family. Prince Harry And Meghan Markle attend the UK team trials for the Invictus Games in April Credit: Samir Hussein Executives at Fox have signed\u00a0Modern Family executive producer Danny Zuker to write\u00a0and a British director, Christine Gernon, to direct. Deadline also reported that the pilot show had sold for what is\u00a0\u201cbelieved to be the biggest commitment for a comedy pitch at the network so far this season.\" While it\u00a0is not clear when filming would begin, one thing is for sure: it is guaranteed to attract audiences and headlines when it does appear on screens.","published_at":1526471981,"content_id":"46c70224-6785-35c7-921a-4beb7d99666a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/meghan-markle-apos-first-husband-145443849.html","content_published_at":1526479500,"content_time":1526479500,"content_relative_time":1,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Media

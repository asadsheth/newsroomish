Black-clad Benjamin Herman, 31, \u201chunted down\u201d his two female police victims, aged 44 and 53, before attacking them from behind with a knife and executing them with their own guns on Tuesday morning.\u00a0\u00a0 Brandishing the pistols, the Belgian shot dead 22-year-old\u00a0Cyril Vangriecken, who was in his car, before\u00a0taking a female hostage at a nearby high school. Herman was gunned down by elite officers, who shot him 20 times, after he shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and fired on police, wounding four. The hostage, a cleaning lady, was unharmed and local media reported she was freed by Herman after telling him she was Muslim. Video: How the attack on the Belgian city of Liege unfolded On Wednesday, Belgian prosecutors confirmed\u00a0they had opened a terror investigation into the attack because it matched the style of similar Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-inspired attacks. Federal prosecutors' spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt told a press conference: \"The facts are qualified as\u00a0terrorist\u00a0murder\u00a0and attempted\u00a0terrorist\u00a0murder.\" Describing the killings as\u00a0\"terrorist murder\",\u00a0federal magistrate Wenke Roggen said the investigation now centres on if the attacker acted alone. Mr Roggeen said the attack is being treated as terrorism given the way Herman acted, which she says resembled Isil calls via video to attack police with knives and steal their weapons, the fact that he yelled Allahu Akbar and was in contact with radicalised people. One of the murdered police officers was named in local media reports as\u00a0 Soraya Belkacemi, a widowed mother of twins, who are now orphaned. The other was Lucile Garcia, 53, who was described by fellow officers as a \"fantastic colleague\" who had married her partner a month ago.\u00a0 Soraya Belkacemi, left, and Lucile Garcia were murdered by\u00a0Benjamin Herman Credit: Facebook\u00a0 Cyril Vangriecken was shot dead in his car They said a separate investigation was running into whether or not Herman, a cocaine and heroin addict,\u00a0killed Michael Wilmot, bludgeoning the 29-year-old to death with a hammer, the night before he ran amok. Mr Wilmot was a former cellmate of Herman\u2019s. There is speculation in local media that his killing in\u00a0the town of On, in southern Belgium, might be linked to a\u00a0Monday night burglary at a jewellers in Herman\u2019s hometown of Rochefort. Jan Jambon, Belgium\u2019s minister of the interior, said on Wednesday that police were investigating possible links between the murder of Mr Wilmot and the killings on Tuesday, which was when Herman was meant to hand himself back into prison. \u201cHe no longer had prospects in our society because he had already committed\u00a0a murder. The psychology of that man raises many questions,\u201d Mr Jambon said before confirming that police were investigating whether Herman was on drugs at the time of his attack. Forensic officers scour the scene for clues Credit: Geert Vanden Wijngaert\u00a0\/AP Despite being on a terror watch list for radicalised prisoners and being judged \u201cultra violent\u201d by prison service authorities, Herman was granted temporary release from prison, where he was serving a seven-year sentence, on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0 Herman had already been granted 13 previous two-day breaks from prison as part of his rehabilitation without any incident, said Koen Geens, Belgium\u2019s justice minister. Mr Goens admitted that he would have to \u201cexamine his conscience\u201d over the decision to grant Herman two days\u2019 release from prison. Armed Belgian police walk past the scene of the shooting in the centre of Liege Credit: Geert Vanden Wijngaert\/AP\u00a0 Herman\u2019s father told Belgian media that Herman had given no hint of the carnage he was soon to wreak on Monday. \u201cThis is insane,\" he said. \"Benjamin was still here on Monday. He was here with some children of a friend of his. \"They have played on the trampoline here in my garden. He was very normal. At one point he has started to buy ice cream for us all.\u201d Liege shooting At a Wednesday morning press conference, the Belgian federal prosecutors\u2019 office praised Liege police for their swift actions, which prevented a far worse tragedy. Mr Jambon said: \"The police did an extraordinary job.\u00a0They reacted well. All the systems, all the procedures worked. \"But if you are attacked from behind, as was the case with the two officers, you can't do anything.\"","published_at":1527705837,"content_id":"5c831091-70f4-3892-adea-d469281e364c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/belgium-terrorist-attack-liege-gunman-101100282.html","content_published_at":1527683491,"content_time":1527683491,"content_relative_time":9,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Syrian

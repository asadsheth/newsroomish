While it's likely Williamson will be back at some point during the Giants three-city trip, he was not added to the roster ahead of Tuesday's contest in Houston. Instead, the Giants called up left-handed reliever Josh Osich from Triple-A Sacramento to replace right-hander Jose Valdez, who was placed on the 10-day disabled list with right elbow inflammation.

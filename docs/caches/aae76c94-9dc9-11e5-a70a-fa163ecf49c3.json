He's clearly the wildcard here but I think we're all aware of his potential; we saw glimpses of it during his 2015 stint in the majors when injuries to Christian Vazquez and Ryan Hanigan forced the Sox to call Swihart up to the majors. Swihart fared well enough in 84 games for us to remain encouraged about his future as he posted a .312 wOBA with limited power and while his plate discipline wasn't ideal, let's remember that he was only 23 at the time. Vazquez returned in 2016 and the Sox tried keeping Swihart's bat in the lineup by giving him reps in the outfield.

As Marrero rounded first, Alex Avila went back to first as if he was going to tag. He retreated just far enough for Marrero to get about a step ahead of Avila. Marrero gave Avila an annoyed look, but the two straightened things out and continued the home run trot. When they crossed home plate, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was already out to contest the mishap. And replays would show that Marrero indeed passed Avila, briefly.

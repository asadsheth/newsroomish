The 27-year-old center fielder is a two-time Gold Glove winner (and deservedly so, unlike several players who have been past recipients) that was selected to the 2017 All-Star Game. Inciarte also posted a 200-hit season (not a small feat) in 2017 and, in an Atlanta Braves uniform over two-plus seasons, has been worth more than six wins according to both FanGraphs and Baseball-Reference. Just a few months ago, Inciarte was a beloved figure in Braves Country, appeasing traditional and casual fans with a .298 batting average over two seasons in Atlanta and generating only faint whispers to question his perch at the top of Atlanta's batting order on a daily basis.","published_at":1523549221,"content_id":"a9320f46-35cf-3849-8acf-8a3e158460e4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.talkingchop.com\/2018\/4\/12\/17223914\/ender-inciarte-atlanta-braves-center-field-batting-order-lineup-reality-check","content_published_at":1523509200,"content_time":1523509200,"content_relative_time":33,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-965f1f39-28ff-32ff-a0c0-1c4f93ba209f_a-78d0a474-a5bb-35c2-b3b3-b92e6621abe3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/ok-seriously-did-hunter-dozier-2ikbzxm","author":"third_watch","provider":"Royals Review","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.royalsreview.com\/2018\/4\/12\/17223096\/ok-but-seriously-what-did-hunter-dozier-do-to-deserve-this","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1y.2AaLa8uyNuqkWuHts0g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QOiiFXsJclRJXYMdz.i.Ag--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_78d0a474-a5bb-35c2-b3b3-b92e6621abe3--698078805.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RIooWEPb82IRaQiiUTid5g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QOiiFXsJclRJXYMdz.i.Ag--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_78d0a474-a5bb-35c2-b3b3-b92e6621abe3--698078805.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QOiiFXsJclRJXYMdz.i.Ag--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_78d0a474-a5bb-35c2-b3b3-b92e6621abe3--698078805.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"Ok but seriously what did Hunter Dozier do to deserve this","summary":"You've probably also heard that the Kansas City Royals called up Abraham Almonte, who they inexplicably signed last week for no apparent reason.

He's almost 29 and pretty much the definition of a milquetoast replacement level outfielder. That he will probably be the starting center fielder until Gordon's return is pretty indicative of how this season is going to go.

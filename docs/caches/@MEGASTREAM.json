Oh, and the editor of one of Russia's most notorious media outlets is using it to mock Elon Musk.\u00a0 Just another day in 2018. SEE ALSO: An ad industry group nominated Russia's election hack for all the awards Taking his role of real-life Bond villain to new heights, Putin used his annual state-of-the-nation speech to the Russian Federal Assembly on Thursday to brag about the country's new nuclear weapons he claimed could hit any point on the globe and would render any defense \"useless.\"\u00a0 Seriously, look at this thing. It's like something out of a comic book (assuming it exists). And taking that supervillain analogy one-step further, Putin's speech was full of bombast. Per NBC News' translation: That's frightening enough as it is but as Gizmodo notes, the video showing off this new super-weapon uses a not-so-innocuous target on which to rain down its radioactive terror: the state of Florida.\u00a0 Yep, that's the central portion of the state, including Tampa Bay, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and (of course) Palm Beach, home of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\u00a0 Central Florida, doomed peninsulaImage: Screenshot\/RT Sure, it looks nice right now...Image: Screenshot\/Google MapsTL;DR, Putin is out here dropping casual threats of nuclear armageddon on the part of the country where Trump likes to go golf and solicit gun control advice from country club members. This can't be good for the pair's complex bromance. You can watch Putin's complete two-hour speech here. If this seems familiar, it's pretty similar to the same stunt that North Korea pulled almost two years ago when it shared a propaganda video that included the nuclear obliteration of Washington, D.C. Cool.

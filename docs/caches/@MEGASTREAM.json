Lynch and Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony that he opposed a proposal for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team to meet with Russians has been contradicted by three people who told Reuters they have spoken about the matter to investigators with Special Counsel Robert Mueller or congressional committees. Sessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he \"pushed back\" against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting.","published_at":1521402212,"content_id":"638c1351-77a2-3e62-88e5-c5ab89d917c0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-sources-contradict-sessions-testimony-opposed-russia-outreach-144029068.html","content_published_at":1521402212,"content_time":1521402212,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":4630,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-c2bc89e5-f013-3789-8c3f-c94a752628b9_c-c733589d-7ce8-3043-bd14-8d378460c77a_a-c733589d-7ce8-3043-bd14-8d378460c77a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/houston\/v-c2bc89e5-f013-3789-8c3f-c94a752628b9_c-c733589d-7ce8-3043-bd14-8d378460c77a_a-c733589d-7ce8-3043-bd14-8d378460c77a","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Sports Illustrated","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/watch-michigan-apos-mo-wagner-194312678.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bCGYxowd5gKy.26oktd8Kw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/sports_illustrated_941\/75b13059bf549623e9614a8ca280e1c7","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mixjiXGU38.Z8eAT_a3diw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjQ7dz0xMzAwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/sports_illustrated_941\/75b13059bf549623e9614a8ca280e1c7","height":724,"width":1300,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/sports_illustrated_941\/75b13059bf549623e9614a8ca280e1c7","imgw":1300,"imgh":724,"title":"Watch: Michigan's Mo Wagner's Display of Sportsmanship Might Be the Best Moment of March","summary":"Michigan was on the verge of being eliminated from the NCAA tournament by Houston Saturday until freshman Jordan Poole saved the season and sent the Big Ten champions to the Sweet 16 with a game-winning three-pointer as time expired.The shot sent the Wolverines into a frenzy, and as Poole ran around the court, at one point right in front of the Houston bench, his teammates chased him until they eventually made a dog pile under the same basket Poole made his shot. As the Michigan players celebrated the amazing moment, the Cougars were devastated, with one lying on the ground right next to the clump of happy Wolverines.As the chaos ensued following the buzzer-beating shot, Michigan junior Mo Wagner stopped mid-celebration to console Houston's Corey Davis Jr., who was on the Houston bench looking on as the Wolverines sprinted past, celebrating their victory.Wagner also stopped to speak with Houston's Devin Davis, who went 9-of-12 from the free throw line during the game, but missed three of his last four attempts, including his final two, to leave the door open for Michigan to escape with a 64-63 win.The 3-seed Wolverines will play No. 7-seed Texas A&M on Thursday in a West region semifinal.","published_at":1521402192,"content_id":"c733589d-7ce8-3043-bd14-8d378460c77a","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/watch-michigan-apos-mo-wagner-194312678.html","content_published_at":1521402192,"content_time":1521402192,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":101,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-23452463-0fa9-3b85-8aa2-cd9f09e70456_c-808b687d-8e8a-36fb-bd29-b52ac990453b_a-808b687d-8e8a-36fb-bd29-b52ac990453b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/home-garden\/v-23452463-0fa9-3b85-8aa2-cd9f09e70456_c-808b687d-8e8a-36fb-bd29-b52ac990453b_a-808b687d-8e8a-36fb-bd29-b52ac990453b","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Country Living","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.style.yahoo.com\/create-mindful-kitchen-dining-space-102506949.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gQa6fLUxpNU4dNdL3vNJ7g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/country_living_645\/8075ba2421195866fce3214e50d0354a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vi_dfDSc3WBxeAsnAug7xg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/country_living_645\/8075ba2421195866fce3214e50d0354a","height":2666,"width":4000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/country_living_645\/8075ba2421195866fce3214e50d0354a","imgw":4000,"imgh":2666,"title":"How to create a mindful kitchen and dining space","summary":null,"published_at":1521368706,"content_id":"808b687d-8e8a-36fb-bd29-b52ac990453b","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.style.yahoo.com\/create-mindful-kitchen-dining-space-102506949.html","content_published_at":1521368706,"content_time":1521368706,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":55,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"photoset_link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9_a-843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9_a-843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"UPI","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Entertainment_News\/2018\/03\/19\/Coco-Austin-spends-39th-birthday-with-Ice-T-daughter-Chanel\/6981521465631\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xrgXUbXs3Rk04xWk5Zlglg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N1V0.7TpCiCSb35mYZ2bBw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9-827176126.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/degZSg274gtf4bNIJz93ZA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTk7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N1V0.7TpCiCSb35mYZ2bBw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9-827176126.jpeg","height":399,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N1V0.7TpCiCSb35mYZ2bBw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zOTk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_843ac2aa-a073-3dd2-b800-b2b1680e44e9-827176126.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":399,"title":"Coco Austin spends 39th birthday with Ice-T, daughter Chanel","summary":"March 19 (UPI) -- Coco Austin enjoyed a family outing on her 39th birthday Saturday.

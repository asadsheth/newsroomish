Authorities also identified pharmaceutical magnate Sherman and his wife, Honey, as the two people found dead in a north Toronto mansion Friday. Police call the deaths suspicious, but on Friday also said that there were no signs of forced entry and that they were not looking for any suspect. The Sherman family issued a statement Saturday urging police to conduct a \"thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation\" into the deaths and calling on the media to avoid speculating on the cause of the deaths. Canadian Business magazine recently estimated his worth at 4.77 billion Canadian dollars ($3.65 billion), making him the 15th richest person in the country. But the Shermans didn\u2019t flaunt their wealth. He drove beat-up cars. They recently put up their house for sale for 6.9 million Canadian dollars ($5.4 million), but the home is relatively modest for a billionaire. Flowers from mourners are seen outside the home of billionaire founder of Canadian pharmaceutical firm Apotex Inc., Barry Sherman and his wife Honey Credit: Chris Helgren\/Reuters Sherman founded Toronto-based Apotex Inc. in 1974 with two employees and turned the generic drugmaker into a company that now has 11,000 employees worldwide. The company released a statement Saturday paying tribute to its founder, praising both his philanthropic efforts and what it described as his vision for health care. The Shermans were among Canada\u2019s most generous philanthropists, and their deaths shocked Canadian high society and the country\u2019s Jewish community. The couple made numerous multimillion-dollar donations to hospitals, schools and charities and had buildings named in their honor. They hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Liberal Party fundraiser in 2015. Honey Sherman was sat on the boards of several civic groups, including Mount Sinai\u2019s Women\u2019s Auxiliary, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the International American Joint Distribution Committee. Linda Frum, a Canadian senator and close friend of the couple, said they were one of the kindest and most beloved members of Canada\u2019s Jewish community. \"Our community is steeped in grief. I am heartbroken,\" Frum tweeted Barry Sherman was not without controversy. He faced legal action from family members alleging they had been cut out of the company over the years. A judge dismissed the claim. \u00a0","published_at":1513572898,"content_id":"35d9a35c-6e00-3278-82c0-49f527ac6dbc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/toronto-detectives-billionaire-barry-sherman-045458348.html","content_published_at":1513572898,"content_time":1513572898,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":170,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-78bf6652-7431-11e5-8af2-fa163e6f4a7e_c-d0fa2593-02eb-3de1-a32f-acd7ea5760dd_a-d0fa2593-02eb-3de1-a32f-acd7ea5760dd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/north-korea\/v-78bf6652-7431-11e5-8af2-fa163e6f4a7e_c-d0fa2593-02eb-3de1-a32f-acd7ea5760dd_a-d0fa2593-02eb-3de1-a32f-acd7ea5760dd","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/china-russia-train-war-u-225728765.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/M_ZGvnAYQh35eKwwHO7vAw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/f6fedd41a039ccfc5bbf747e5bce3e30","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/TFXmr1ptZSRTWc.soBBBZQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/f6fedd41a039ccfc5bbf747e5bce3e30","height":1333,"width":2000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/f6fedd41a039ccfc5bbf747e5bce3e30","imgw":2000,"imgh":1333,"title":"China and Russia Train for War With U.S. if Trump Invades North Korea","summary":"China and Russia may be devising a plan to attack U.S. forces in\u00a0the event of an imminent war breaking out on the neighboring Korean Peninsula, according to two former military officials.

The woman, 22, found a guy she met at a bar in her bed the morning after she'd been out drinking heavily with him and others. With the help of her roommate, she kicked the man out. But he returned the next day, somehow entered her apartment in the 2200 block of North Racine and allegedly tried to smother her with a pillow, according to authorities. The alleged strangulation took place at 5 a.m. on July 21, when the woman woke up to see the same man that she'd met at the bar earlier standing over her.

King of Arkansas. The identification was made by the California-based nonprofit DNA Doe Project and confirmed on Monday by the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab in Dayton, Ohio.","published_at":1523572320,"content_id":"00ed00d5-9976-3edc-b75f-6b57ed0bf7e8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas-183407446--abc-news-topstories.html","content_published_at":1523572320,"content_time":1523572320,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":570,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-711dd716-090e-3999-ab37-877d306a4dd6_c-45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1_a-45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/star-wars\/v-711dd716-090e-3999-ab37-877d306a4dd6_c-45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1_a-45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"CINEMABLEND","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2402822\/what-star-wars-the-last-jedis-final-shot-really-means-according-to-mark-hamill","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qyzs4r.w.msDmAjkfwgbqw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LgOkj9m9Z1Z6ZB4nPKe9Qg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1--34567139.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/d1jmctBLWOKqhkVvQUDxxg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LgOkj9m9Z1Z6ZB4nPKe9Qg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1--34567139.jpeg","height":300,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LgOkj9m9Z1Z6ZB4nPKe9Qg--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_45237a40-8eaa-32ff-8e06-e97dfd98bed1--34567139.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":300,"title":"What Star Wars: The Last Jedi's Final Shot Really Means, According To Mark Hamill","summary":"Like Mark Hamill, I think many of us thought 'Wait, did he just do that?' upon seeing the Broom Kid, whose name is apparently Temiri Blagg, use the Force to move the broom to him. This scene was interesting because it was almost like a second ending to the film, practically a post-credits scene that let audiences know about the success of Luke's sacrifice and the enduring existence of light side Force users in the galaxy. As Mark Hamill told GamesRadar, Rey is only the last Jedi for now.

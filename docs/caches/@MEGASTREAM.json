He's been feeling unappreciated from the moment the promotion started favoring Conor McGregor over him, and actions like not granting him an immediate rematch against McGregor and not allowing him to box like McGregor haven't helped. From this mindset comes a very obvious take on Frankie Edgar's unfortunate loss to Brian Ortega at UFC 222. \u201dI just thought it was a mistake on Edgar's end to fight Brian, who's a very tough guy,\u201d he said on Brazil's 'Giro Combate' show (translation via MMA Junkie). \u201cHe would have fought for the title, but he risked that and lost. Now he's all the way back there again.","published_at":1520830800,"content_id":"37491c5a-d0a9-38aa-bf4e-1ee6262d1350","content_url":"https:\/\/www.mmamania.com\/2018\/3\/12\/17108648\/jose-aldo-frankie-edgar-made-biggest-mistake-fighting-brian-ortega-ufc-222","content_published_at":1520830800,"content_time":1520830800,"content_relative_time":11,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e_a-19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e_a-19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/brucelee\/2018\/03\/11\/here-is-why-your-cat-may-be-plotting-to-kill-you\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N43G7gA84libB6NZpMEtxQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9vs5pcakqKKmMy71lagMNQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e--1374454620.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/a5X8.0tCS3mYZCR_9cYFaw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9vs5pcakqKKmMy71lagMNQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e--1374454620.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9vs5pcakqKKmMy71lagMNQ--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_19162bf4-0193-34e0-b6f4-df0c2868f48e--1374454620.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"Here Is Why Your Cat May Be Plotting To Kill You","summary":"Think about this the next time you dress your cat up to look like an elf or a little sailor.

Trump in 2006. Daniels' new attorney,\u00a0Michael Avenatti, has been a fixture on TV. Daniels herself is scheduled to be interviewed on 60 Minutes on March 25. But another woman, former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal, whose story has attracted significantly less attention, may end up being a bigger problem for Trump. (McDougal will appear on TV this Thursday on CNN with Anderson Cooper.) In some respects, McDougal's story is similar to Daniels'. Like Daniels, she met Trump at a 2006 golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Trump later wined and dined both women at the Beverly Hills Hotel.","published_at":1521648240,"content_id":"76ab0881-b64c-38ae-87c7-40ab0b4d13bd","content_url":"https:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/stormy-daniels-is-in-the-headlines-but-karen-mcdougal-is-a-bigger-problem-for-trump-8e92be797141\/","content_published_at":1521648240,"content_time":1521648240,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":25,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-a2207e44-4ace-3c9a-a3af-2bc57aea2d71_c-0518d0f2-1c36-3886-af44-832c7dba2a7c_a-0518d0f2-1c36-3886-af44-832c7dba2a7c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/barack-obama\/v-a2207e44-4ace-3c9a-a3af-2bc57aea2d71_c-0518d0f2-1c36-3886-af44-832c7dba2a7c_a-0518d0f2-1c36-3886-af44-832c7dba2a7c","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Yahoo News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/obamas-pen-letter-parkland-students-youve-helped-awaken-conscience-nation-183236467.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8jyqeFqtJHb9nvw0YpfFUg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/d85e4f7321db125ba23c67e0cb417157","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/JLYxZ9y36JWY7wkKw2q9rQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xODk3O3c9MzMwMjs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/d85e4f7321db125ba23c67e0cb417157","height":1897,"width":3302,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/d85e4f7321db125ba23c67e0cb417157","imgw":3302,"imgh":1897,"title":"Obamas pen letter to Parkland students: 'You've helped awaken the conscience of the nation'","summary":"Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama sent a handwritten letter earlier this month to the survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., saying they have been \u201cinspired by the resilience, resolve and solidarity\u201d shown by the students.","published_at":1521657156,"content_id":"0518d0f2-1c36-3886-af44-832c7dba2a7c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/obamas-pen-letter-parkland-students-youve-helped-awaken-conscience-nation-183236467.html","content_published_at":1521657156,"content_time":1521657156,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":1390,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96_a-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96_a-4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Fox News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/food-drink\/2018\/03\/20\/mcdonald-s-customer-turns-violent-after-receiving-wrong-breakfast-order.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/A8S3dsOmmK4844yw1wjZVg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qLbxP1PvUnJ.jF.8rnB6Uw--\/dz05MzE7aD01MjQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96-880525832.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/I8ElXAgiTokd5HPiGZfK4w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MjQ7dz05MzE7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qLbxP1PvUnJ.jF.8rnB6Uw--\/dz05MzE7aD01MjQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96-880525832.jpeg","height":524,"width":931,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qLbxP1PvUnJ.jF.8rnB6Uw--\/dz05MzE7aD01MjQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4eb761d8-eeea-39ec-874a-43041f300e96-880525832.jpeg","imgw":931,"imgh":524,"title":"McDonald's customer turns violent after receiving wrong breakfast order","summary":"Police in Glendale, Wis., are currently seeking the public's help in identifying an irate McDonald's customer who assaulted a teenage employee after receiving the wrong breakfast order.

Mark Conditt, 23, died in the early hours of Wednesday, killing himself in his car as a SWAT team closed in on him in the town of\u00a0Round Rock, 20 miles from Austin.\u00a0 Police said that they had learnt of his identity in the previous 24 hours, when he had dropped off a package at a FedEx in Austin and was caught on CCTV. They then obtained his Google search records, and found suspicious activity. Conditt is suspected of carrying out at least five bomb attacks in the Austin area, killing two people and wounding several more. Police said that he used hardware store supplies to make pipe bombs \u2013 like those used in the failed New York subway bombing late last year. Police are unsure if he made the bombs alone or had help. Brian Manley, right, Austin chief of police Officials have not given a motive for the bombings and Brian Manley, chief of Austin police, said that they were still concerned there could be more unexploded devices. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where this suspect has spent his last 24 hours, and therefore we need to remain vigilant to be sure no other packages have been left throughout the community,\u201d he said. Austin homicide detective David Fugitt said Conditt's parents and three sisters have been \"very cooperative,\" adding that officials didn't have any indication the family knew Conditt was involved with the bombings. \"They have gone above and beyond to answer any questions we have had,\" he said. On Wednesday the family issued a statement saying they were \u201cdevastated and broken\u201d to be caught up in the attacks. \u201cWe had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in. Our family is a normal family in every way. We love, we pray, and we try to inspire and serve others. \u201cRight now our prayers are for those families that have lost loved ones, for those impacted in any way, and for the soul of our Mark.\u201d Police in Austin Conditt lived in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, in a house he shared with two roommates \u2013 both of whom were detained and questioned by investigators on Wednesday. Mark Roessler, an IT manager, lived across the street from the house and told The Telegraph that Conditt and his father Pat bought the house about two years ago as a \u201cfixer upper project\u201d. He described Conditt as \u201cvery polite\u201d said he and his father worked together for about a year, before Conditt moved in.\u00a0 \u201cIt was obvious the dad had a loving bond for his son,\u201d said Mr Roessler. \u201cHe confided in me he was trying to build their relationship. \u201cMark was quiet. He invited me into the house two or three times and I saw the remodel work. \u201cMark moved in sometime last year and I haven\u2019t seen much of him since. I would see people his age, males, come and go from the house.\u201d Candy Buchleitner has lived near the family for five years, keeping chickens in her backyard. She told The Telegraph that the neighborhood is normally very quiet, and home to mostly older people. It backs up to about 20 acres of undeveloped land. She did not know the family of the suspected bomber but said she was sad to hear they are grieving. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy all around,\u201d she said. \u201cThey lost a son and now everybody is on top of them.\u201d Crime scene tape blocks access to the public as FBI agents collect evidence at a FedEx Office facility following an explosion at a nearby sorting center on March 20, 2018 in Sunset Valley, Texas From an early age the siblings were all were home-schooled by their mother,\u00a0Danene Conditt.\u00a0 Jeremiah Jensen, 24, who was homeschooled in the same Pflugerville community as Conditt, told the American-Statesman that Conditt was a little \u201crough around the edges\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to think that one of my friends succumbed to hatred of some sort,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no idea what caused him to make those bombs. Whatever it was I wish he would have reached out to me and asked for help or something.\u201d Jensen was one of only about a dozen friends listed on Conditt\u2019s Facebook page before it was removed on Wednesday morning. The two were close in 2012 and 2013, said Jensen, who would often go to the Conditts\u2019 home for lunch after Sunday church service and attending Bible study and other activities together. Mr Jensen said Conditt came from a good family, was athletic, enjoyed rock climbing and parkour and was a \u201cdeep thinker.\u201d \u201cWhen I met Mark, he was really rough around the edges,\u201d Mr Jensen said. \u201cHe was a very assertive person and would \u2026 end up being kind of dominant and intimidating in conversation. A lot of people didn\u2019t understand him and where he was coming from. He really just wanted to tell the truth. What I remember about him he would push back on you if you said something without thinking about it. He loved to think and argue and turn things over and figure out what was really going on.\u201d Mr Jensen said Conditt attended regular church services at the Austin Stone Community Church. \u201cI know faith was a serious thing for him,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he held onto his faith or not. \u2026 The kind of anger that he expressed and the kind of hate that he succumbed to \u2014 that\u2019s not what he believed in in high school. I don\u2019t know what happened along the way. This wasn\u2019t him.\u201d Mr Jensen said that he and many of his fellow homeschooled students felt loneliness. \u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult for a lot of kids to find a way to fit in once they are out in the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a feeling that is what happened with Mark. I don\u2019t remember him ever being sure of what he wanted to do.\u201d Investigators work at the scene of a bombing on Dawn Song Drive in the Travis Country neighborhood on Monday March 19 As part of his studies he appears to have written a blog, with six postings discussing social and political issues between January and May 2012. Introducing himself, he wrote:\u00a0\"I enjoy cycling, parkour, tennis, reading, and listening to music.\u00a0 \u201cI am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended.\u00a0 \u201cThe reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\" His postings show him to be of moderate conservative leanings - against gay marriage and abortion, and in favour of the death penalty. Donna Sebastian Harp, who has known the family for 18 years, described Conditt as a quiet man from a \u201ctight-knit, godly family\u201d. \u201cHe was a nerd, always reading, devouring books and computers and things like that,\u201d Ms. Harp said. Mrs Conditt\u00a0posted a photo her son in February 2013 on Facebook, saying: \"I officially graduated Mark from High School on Friday. 1 down, 3 to go.

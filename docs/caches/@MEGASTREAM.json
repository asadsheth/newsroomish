Errol Musk, 72, described the 10-month-old baby boy he had with Jana Bezuidenhout, 30, as \u201cexquisite\u201d. He married her mother Heide when Jana was four but told The Sunday Times he did not consider her to be his stepdaughter because she had been raised away from the family for long periods of time. Jana Bezuidenhout, 30, who had a child with her stepfather Errol Musk He had two children with Ms Bezuidenhout\u2019s mother before divorcing after 18 years of marriage.

She said I had changed her life,\u201d he added.

But Drew Chatman's choice in celebration cost him the victory he'd just achieved. In some of the most bizarre scenes you'll see inside the cage, Chatman won his first bout after opponent Irvins Ayala knocked himself out. As Chatman lay on his back, Ayala tried to throw a hammerfist, but his chin caught Chatman's knee on his way down and turned his own lights out. After the referee waved off the fight and awarded the victory to Chatman, he stood on the back of his passed-out opponent and attempted a front flip. The completely unnecessary and disrespectful act got Chatman a disqualification and handed the win instead to Ayala.","published_at":1521997194,"content_id":"de9bad2a-3758-3623-8a28-347b77f6cc5f","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/03\/25\/worst-mma-winner-gets-karma-for-front-flipping-off-knocked-out-fighter\/","content_published_at":1521997194,"content_time":1521997194,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":39,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

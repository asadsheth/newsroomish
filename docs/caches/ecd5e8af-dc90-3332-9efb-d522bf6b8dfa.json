Trump has made his @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account an integral and controversial part of his presidency, using it to promote his agenda, announce policy and attack critics. U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan ruled that comments on the president's account, and those of other government officials, were public forums, and that blocking Twitter users for their views violated their right to free speech under the First Amendment of Constitution.","published_at":1527095178,"content_id":"5368f7d9-90a3-334a-8a69-a52288e83a13","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-may-not-block-twitter-users-over-political-170618586--finance.html","content_published_at":1527111921,"content_time":1527111921,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

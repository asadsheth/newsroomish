The contradiction helped kill their marriage and destroyed the esteem in which she was held by many South Africans, although the firebrand activist retained the support of radical black nationalists to the end. In her twilight years, Madikizela-Mandela, who died on Monday aged 81, had frequent run-ins with authority that further undermined her reputation as a fighter against the white-minority regime that ran Africa's most advanced economy from 1948 to 1994.","published_at":1522679275,"content_id":"6c3f43a2-de7a-39aa-a7cd-4fa065fd176c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/winnie-mandela-mother-then-mugger-south-africa-141813663.html","content_published_at":1522679275,"content_time":1522679275,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

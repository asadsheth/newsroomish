Emery settles in as final piece of Ivan Gazidis's Arsenal takeover","summary":"The words came out a little hesitantly at first, like the teenage substitute summoned from the bench for his debut, and not all of them sounded quite as they were intended, but Unai Emery was determined to conduct the first part of his first Arsenal press conference in English. In many ways, it felt like the biggest struggle of the day, to sit in the Emirates Stadium chair occupied for the past 12 years by one of the most skilful linguists in the business and speak a language with which Emery had just a passing acquaintance. Emery was out of his comfort zone, and yet he seemed to relish the challenge, and the thought occurred that, over recent years, there were too few among the Arsenal squad who could say the same. There will be plenty of those, of course, who will delight in citing the Andrew Sachs comparison, which was an easy shot to throw at Emery, but as he wrestled irregular verbs and rearranged an array of vowel sounds, we had a little glimpse of the man\u2019s determination. Besides, the last foreign manager to come to England and draw comparisons between himself and a Spanish waiter ended up doing rather well. What was remarkable was that aside from the challenge of battling the English language \u2013 let\u2019s call it an honourable draw, with Emery the favourite for the rematch \u2013 there was so little pressure from elsewhere. For years, English football speculated on what it would be like to follow in the giant footsteps of Wenger but this has turned out to be a velvet revolution, with scarcely a shot fired on either side and the new man installed before the first World Cup warm-up. When David Moyes took over from Sir Alex Ferguson, such was the pressure it felt like the room was that little bit smaller every time he walked in. He was pitched straight into the Wayne Rooney saga, trying to placate his best player without offending the man who had endorsed him. At Jose Mourinho\u2019s return to Chelsea for the second time, he was assailed by the question of how he would relaunch the club\u2019s then badly-misfiring luxury purchase, Fernando Torres. But Emery was asked just one thorny question about Jack Wilshere\u2019s future, which he stroked back over the net with what he said was his intention to speak \u201cglobally\u201d about the team, a useful notion that he later returned to. This is Arsenal in 2018, an elite club who in terms of their players has reached ground zero \u2013 those that could have gone elsewhere have gone elsewhere, and there are no superstars left whom they have either to appease or eject. It would be tempting to say that the only way is up, but it is early days yet. Unai Emery: what style can Arsenal expect from their new manager? Alongside Emery, and surely also marvelling at the new Arsenal manager\u2019s re-interpretation of the stresses and emphasis integral to the pronunciation of the word \u201cexplain\u201d, was Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive who has waited nine years for the advent of the last five weeks. He has full control of Arsenal now and it would be right to say that he came out of his corner swinging. Gazidis disclosed the number of candidates on the longlist (eight) and the shortlist (three); he offered up specific dates for the first and last interviews; for Emery\u2019s first interview, his second with London board members and the flight to Atlanta on Monday to see Stan and Josh Kroenke. There was the 100-page Emery dossier, hours of video analysis and Raul Sanllehi (director of football relations) and Sven Mislintat (head of recruitment) working like a couple of pit ponies in a cold snap. Gazidis described it as the process, but by the end we were left in no doubt that it was more like The Process. Emery might have been the unanimous choice of Gazidis, Sanllehi and Mislintat, but it is Gazidis who brought the latter two to the club and, by extension Emery, too \u2013 the three of them the team that the chief executive has personally recruited. Emery is, as Gazidis said again, the final piece of the post-Wenger era, the culmination of the handover of power that has seen the easing out of the ancien regime. What can Arsenal expect from new manager Unai Emery? Whether it was true or not, Wenger had never exerted too much effort trying to dissuade people that it was he who endorsed Gazidis\u2019s appointment in 2008 and that, while the chief executive might have the title, it was he who called the shots. Wenger was the older of the two, and the club\u2019s public face but since the day his departure was announced by Gazidis, that has changed. Emery is the chief executive\u2019s man, and while there was the whiff of the bromance about these two \u2013 \u201ca chemistry\u201d, said Gazidis \u2013 there is no doubting who holds the power. Emery, Sanllehi, and Mislintat work for Gazidis and, in turn, he answers to the Kroenkes. It is a chain of command at Arsenal that was never quite so clear before. It was strange to see another manager in Wenger\u2019s chair, talking about Wenger\u2019s players, wearing Wenger\u2019s suit \u2013 or at least a suit like the one Wenger once wore. Both Emery and Gazidis paid tribute to Wenger\u2019s legacy, and that legacy has many elements to it, but none felt particularly daunting for a competent young coach. Especially not one who was confident enough to speak a new language in a new country at a new club that, helpfully for him, has a huge appetite for change.","published_at":1527143415,"content_id":"cdacc65f-fcc7-37ec-b6c6-08c990cf1448","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/unai-emery-settles-final-piece-192303396.html","content_published_at":1527103383,"content_time":1527103383,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Champions

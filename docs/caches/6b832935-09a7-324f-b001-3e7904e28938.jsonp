Meghan Markle's close friend who flew straight from the royal wedding to Bangladesh","summary":"If there's one friend\u00a0the Duchess of Sussex will have been excitedly messaging over the last few days, it's probably Priyanka Chopra. \u201cShe still texts a lot, which is great,\" the Indian actress and former Miss World winner\u00a0said earlier this month.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s such a girl\u2019s girl.\" Chopra\u00a0was a guest at this weekend's wedding, and has been busily sharing her wedding snaps on Instagram,\u00a0telling her followers that she \"danced the night away\". When they first met, at a dinner celebrating women in television in 2016, Chopra was easily the more famous of the pair.\u00a0In much of the world she still is. In the US, Chopra is best known for playing FBI agent Alex Parrish in the TV series Quantico, but in India she is revered as one of the country's most famous film stars. Before her Hollywood breakthrough in\u00a0last year's film remake of Baywatch, Chopra already had more than 50 Bollywood film roles under her belt;\u00a0her 2012 thriller Agneepath made more money at the box office in a single day\u00a0than any film in India's history. Early in her career, she heard a callous producer tell her manager that \"women are replaceable\"\u00a0\u2013 a comment that left her in tears. From that day on, she resolved only to take on strong, \"irreplacable\"\u00a0characters; highlights include playing boxing champion Mary Kom in a biopic about the Olympic athlete's life, and a black widow\u00a0who murders seven of her husbands in Bollywood\u00a0comedy\u00a07 Khoon Maaf. The daughter of two Indian army doctors, Chopra was moved to the US aged 13, where she lived for five years \u2013 often facing racist bullying at school, where people would insult her appearance. \"It broke my spirit,\" she told Glamour magazine in 2016. \"It made me question who I was. Why was it so uncool being Indian?\" In response, she has said, \"I taught myself confidence...\u00a0You've got to teach yourself to take over the world.\"\u00a0Less than two years after she moved back to India, she was crowned the winner of the Miss World beauty pageant.

She became a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights in 2010, using her celebrity profile to promote the cause.\u00a0This Monday, less than 48 hours after the royal wedding, she had already flown over to Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, on a Unicef field visit to a refugee camp for the Rohingya people, who had fled ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. I\u2019m in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh today for a field visit with UNICEF, to one of the largest refugee camps in the world. In the second half of 2017, the world saw horrific images of ethnic cleansing from the Rakhine State of Myanmar(Burma). This violence drove nearly 700,000 Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh - 60% are children! Many months later they are still highly vulnerable, living in overcrowded camps with no idea when or where they will ever belong...even worse, when they will get their next meal. AND...as they finally start to settle and feel a sense of safety, monsoon season looms...threatening to destroy all that they\u2019ve built so far. This is an entire generation of children that have no future in sight. Through their smiles I could see the vacancy in their eyes. These children are at the forefront of this humanitarian crisis, and they desperately need our help. The world needs to care. We need to care. These kids are our future.

This is an entire generation of children that have no future in sight. Through their smiles I could see the vacancy in their eyes.\" Her tireless work as a campaigner and philanthropist is something she and Meghan have in common. After\u00a0Vanity Fair ran a profile of her friend, Chopra\u00a0was quick to criticise the magazine for\u00a0focusing solely on her relationship with Prince Harry and ignoring her charity work.\u00a0 \"I don't know if I will get into trouble for this, but I have an opinion,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"She's on the cover of\u00a0Vanity Fair. It would have been nice to write about her, not just her boyfriend. I'm just saying. I mean, she's an actor, she's an activist, she's a philanthropist...\u00a0she does so much more.\" When they first met, they instantly \"bonded as actors\", Chopra has said.\u00a0\"We just became friends, like two girls would.\" They would frequently appear on each other's Instagram feeds \u2013 until Meghan deleted her account in January. It's a testament to their closeness that Time magazine asked Chopra to write their profile of the Suits star when she was featured on their 2018 list of the world's 100 most influential people (Chopra had already been on the list herself in 2016).

Her compassion, evident in the causes she supports, and her drive to break down stereotypes \u2013 obvious in her actions \u2013\u00a0will connect her to a generation in much need of kindness.\"","published_at":1526926724,"content_id":"c8c854c8-885b-391f-953b-96541c1288ea","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/priyanka-chopra-meghan-markle-apos-164953986.html","content_published_at":1526921393,"content_time":1526921393,"content_relative_time":49,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Royal family","vibe_id":"6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

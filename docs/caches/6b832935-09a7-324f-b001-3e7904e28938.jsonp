The local council in Coburg, birthplace of both Queen Victoria\u2019s mother and her beloved consort, Prince Albert, says there will be no cross on display in the town hall when the controversial order comes into effect on Friday. The order, issued by the new Bavarian regional prime minister, Markus S\u00f6der, has caused huge public controversy across Germany. Mr S\u00f6der says the cross is \u201ca fundamental symbol of our Bavarian identity and way of life\u201d. But his opponents say he is exploiting a religious symbol for political ends and have denounced the move as unconstitutional. In Coburg, in the former Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the local authorities are taking an independent stance. Norbert Tessmer, the mayor, told the local Neue Presse newspaper he had decided there was no obligation to hang a cross in the town hall as it belongs to the local municipality, and not the regional government.\u00a0 But he conceded crosses would have to be hung in other local public buildings such as the tax office and the law courts. A believer carries a cross, covered with a plastic bag to protect it against the rain, as he takes part in a pilgrimage in Niedertraubling, Germany, Thursday, May 17, 2018 Credit: Peter Kneffel\/dpa Elsewhere in Bavaria, institutions are taking a more confrontational stance. Nuremberg\u2019s famous Neues Musuem is refusing point blank to display a cross, even though it is a public institution. \u201cIt is problematic to make such a display in an institution concerned with the freedom of the arts,\u201d Eva Kraus, the museum director said.\u00a0 The Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich is also taking a stand. \u201cWe have nothing against crosses of any kind, but they should only hang where they belong: in church,\u201d Michael Kr\u00fcger, the academy president said. A spokesman for the Bavarian interior ministry admitted last week that it would not be possible for the ministry to enforce the order in every case.\u00a0 Public protests are planned in Munich on Friday, but a recent poll found 56 per cent of Bavarians in fact support the order, with only 38 per cent against. Support is strong among Roman Catholics, who make up 58 per cent of Bavaria\u2019s population. The order has been endorsed by the Catholic Archbishop of Bamberg, Ludwig Schick.\u00a0 But some of the strongest opposition to the order has come from the church. A leading Catholic theologian accused Mr S\u00f6der of exploiting people\u2019s fears over Muslim migrants ahead of regional elections. \u201cYou are using Christianity to exclude people of other faiths,\u201d Burkhard Hose wrote in an open letter to Mr S\u00f6der. \u201cThe cross is not an extension of a policy of exclusion or nationalistic egoism... I urge you to stop using Christianity as a supposed bulwark against Islam.\u201d The move has also been criticised by the head of the German evangelical church, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm., who warned: \u201cIt is very clear that no one should misuse a religious symbol like the cross for political purposes\u201d.","published_at":1527767414,"content_id":"ad62836b-6159-30eb-8ca4-8b0c84953c99","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/small-bavarian-town-linked-british-114055310.html","content_published_at":1527766855,"content_time":1527766855,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Royal family","vibe_id":"6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-6b832935-09a7-324f-b001-3e7904e28938_c-c64abe42-0640-3083-903e-9bba78cc7393_a-44179ce6-2e63-3bdd-ad91-a8fa4bc8e1b4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/royal-family\/1-major-way-william-kate-11l9p8x","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"PopSugar","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/celebrity\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-05-15\/ae85b9e0-5844-11e8-97dd-498d1f24969f_popsugar.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/1-major-way-william-kate-093017597.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5SRI27RZenSglWHTYBUIug--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/popsugar_celebrity_142\/7742ea0b760b3e36c62f0f45ff3eb592","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OIjFCYd8Wu0rYKr_V6ys7A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMDQ4O3c9MjA0ODs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/popsugar_celebrity_142\/7742ea0b760b3e36c62f0f45ff3eb592","height":2048,"width":2048,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/popsugar_celebrity_142\/7742ea0b760b3e36c62f0f45ff3eb592","imgw":2048,"imgh":2048,"title":"1 Major Way William and Kate's Life Will Change When Charles Becomes King","summary":"Image Source: Getty \/ Pool You know you've made it when you're living at Kensington Palace.

A study quizzed travellers on hotspots across the UK and Europe where they failed to capture a picture they were happy with.

The countries you should visit that she hasn't","summary":"The Queen is almost certainly better travelled than you. After all, she\u2019s been to more than 110 countries (excluding the UK), which earns her the right to join the prestigious Travelers\u2019 Century Club. The average Briton, according to a 2014 poll, has been to just seven. She\u2019s also ticked off some real obscurities. Vanuatu? Check. The Queen and Prince Philip went to the South Pacific island, when it was still called New Hebrides, in 1974 (the Cook Islands, Norfolk Island, New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands were also on the itinerary). And they really made an impression. More than forty years later some Vanuatuan people are still thought to worship the Duke of Edinburgh. Why? A warrior named Chief Jack Naiva, who died in 2009, was one of the paddlers of a war canoe that greeted the royal yacht Britannia at the nation's capital, Port Vila. Chief Jack became convinced that Prince Philip was the descendant of a Tanna spiritual ancestor. \u201cI saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform,\u201d Chief Jack is on record as saying. \u201cI knew then that he was the true messiah.\u201d Prince Philip has exchanged numerous gifts with the islanders, including a signed portrait of himself. Turks and Caicos Islands? Check. The Queen has set foot in more Caribbean nations than you\u2019ve had hot dinners thanks to her role as head of the Commonwealth. Her travel history reads like a cross between a Sandals holiday brochure (Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago\u2026) and a who\u2019s who of corporate tax havens (Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Belize, the Virgin Islands...). In numbers | The Queen's Royal tours Yemen? Check. The Queen visited this nation - currently off-limits due to security concerns - in 1954. Or, more precisely, she visited Aden, a British colony until 1967 and now Yemen\u2019s second biggest city. Other Middle Eastern countries she\u2019s ticked off include Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran. Kiribati? Just 8,000 people visit this tiny nation, comprised of 33 coral atolls stretching along the equator, each year. The Queen has been. It was in 1982, when she also stopped at Tuvalu, Fiji and Nauru). At a glance | Gifts given to the Queen She\u2019s covered most of the world, from Algeria to Zimbabwe, but there are still a few glaring gaps in her holiday scrapbook. Argentina For obvious reasons the Queen has never visited Argentina (though Prince Philip did visit alone in 1962). Indeed, with little historic or political ties to the continent - excluding Guyana and the Falkland Islands - trips to South America have been few and far between. She travelled to Brazil and Chile in 1968, and to Guyana in 1966 (when it was still British Guiana) and 1994, but has never been to Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Bolivia, Venezuela, Suriname, Paraguay or French Guiana. Greece The Queen did visit Greece in 1950, before she became Queen, but has never made a state visit to the country. It\u2019s an interesting omission, particularly given the fact that her husband was a Greek prince born in Corfu. However, as viewers of The Crown will be aware, his relationship with the country is an unhappy one. Prince Philip\u2019s father, Prince Andrew of Greece, was put on trial in 1922 after a Greek military defeat, almost executed, and the entire family - including an infant Philip - was forced into exile. The Duke of Edinburgh has returned occasionally, but always alone. Corfu Old Town Credit: DILYAN KARAIVANOV Costa Rica As with South America, there are few colonial ties between Britain and Central America - Belize, and parts of the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras, excepted. Which explains why the Queen hasn\u2019t visited Costa Rica, the world\u2019s happiest country and heaven for wildlife lovers, Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala or El Salvador. A white-headed capuchin in Costa Rica Credit: WOLLERTZ - STOCK.ADOBE.COM Israel There are obvious reasons why neither Israel nor the Palestinian territories have welcomed the Queen. Security is a major factor. The Foreign Office must approve all state visits, and its advice for ordinary travellers to the region, let alone high-profile ones, is packed with warnings and caveats. Then there is the diplomatic sensitivity over visiting Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital. The Queen is always keen to avoid getting embroiled in political matters. Other Middle Eastern countries The Queen hasn\u2019t visited include Iraq, Syria (both unsafe to visit, according to the Foreign Office) and Lebanon. The world's 15 most dangerous countries (according to the Foreign Office) Albania There\u2019s a fair chunk of Europe yet to receive a state visit from The Queen, mostly minnows and former members of the Soviet Bloc. If you\u2019ve been to Albania, one of Europe\u2019s best-kept travel secrets (and, according to some, a rival to Amalfi Coast), Liechtenstein, Andorra, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Macedonia, Montenegro, Armenia, Georgia or Monaco, you can claim minor bragging rights. Kosovo, too, has not been visited - largely because it didn\u2019t exist before 2008. Better than the Amalfi? Credit: RH2010 - STOCK.ADOBE.COM Note that The Queen has not been to the modern states of Croatia or Serbia, but did visit Dubrovnik, Belgrade and Zagreb in 1972 as a guest of Tito, the 20th century\u2019s least objectionable communist dictator. Cuba Most of the Caribbean has been ticked off, but not all of it. The French overseas territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique, for example. The US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And also Cuba. Again, political and security considerations will have played a part. What has she missed out on? \u201cThe Caribbean\u2019s most fascinating country,\u201d according to our expert, Fred Mawer. \u201cA heady mix of faded Spanish colonial cities, sputtering Fifties Cadillacs, wonderful live music, world-class cigars and an arcane communist system.\u201d Cuba hasn't welcomed The Queen Credit: marcin jucha - Fotolia S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe When it comes to Africa and the Indian Ocean, most current or former Commonwealth members have received the British head of state. South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Kenya, The Gambia, Ghana, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, Malawi, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Mauritius and Tanzania all make the list. But several don\u2019t, namely Rwanda, Cameroon and Lesotho. The Queen has never visited Egypt, either, an omission that might owe something to security concerns and something to the Suez Crisis of 1956. Other destinations not seen by The Queen include Libya, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cape Verde, Comoros, Central African Republic, Gabon, Congo, the DRC, Angola, Burundi, Swaziland, Djibouti, Somalia, Togo, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, South Sudan, Eritrea, Mayotte, Niger, Reunion and\u2026 S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. If she ticks off just one, we\u2019d suggest making it this. According to John Gimlette, who visited recently for Telegraph Travel, they are the paradise islands that tourism forgot. A beach on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Credit: GETTY \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how you might overlook it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I first spotted it on a relief map of the Atlantic, it looked like two needles rising off the ocean floor, each with a tiny island perched on top. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is roughly the size of Anglesey, while Pr\u00edncipe compares to the Isle of Wight. Separated by 99 miles of ocean, they are, in cartological terms, a pair of free-floating full-stops. \u201cCloser up, they\u2019re harder to ignore. From the air, they look improbably dramatic. Having risen 3,000m (9,840ft) off the seabed, parts of them carry on rising another 2,000m (6,560ft). There\u2019s nothing undulating about these mountains. They\u2019re like great blue fangs, covered in a rich velvet of forest and cloud. One of these peaks \u2013 on Pr\u00edncipe \u2013 is so sheer that, until recently, it was thought it had only ever been climbed twice in 31 million years. It\u2019s ridiculous to describe anywhere as a Lost World now, but this one got seriously mislaid.\u201d Madagascar Our monarch has also never been to Madagascar. The island is famous for its lemurs and chameleons, while fans of the Flashman novels will know it for its \u201cmad\u201d 19th century queen, Ranavalona. She thwarted European efforts to gain sway over Madagascar during her 33-year rule, but also focused her energies on brutally eradicating Christians, neighbouring kingdoms and political rivals. So widespread were the purges, and the use of slave labour to construct a vast palace and public works, that the island\u2019s population fell from five million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839. One way Ranavalona maintained order was the tangena ordeal, by which the accused was poisoned, and then forced to eat three pieces of chicken skin. Death, or the failure to regurgitate all three pieces, indicated guilt. Others opponents were simply thrown into vast ravines. The remains of her palace, the Rova of Antananarivo, can still be seen in the capital. A possible stop on any unlikely future royal tour. The Rova of Antananarivo Credit: MILOS KUBUS Mongolia The world\u2019s least crowded country is one of 16 Asian nations never to have welcomed The Queen (the others are Bhutan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, Timor-Leste, North Korea - obviously - and Laos). It really is perfect is you like peace and quiet. Terry Richardson visited for Telegraph Travel last year. \u201cThis enormous landlocked country of green steppe, vast flat plains, intricately braided rivers, electric-blue highland lakes, snow-licked mountains, dense pine forests and shifting desert is presided over by a skyscape of such bold blue immensity it beggars description. It\u2019s not just vast; Mongolia is empty, too. Three times bigger than France, its population is less than a 20th of the UK\u2019s \u2013 and one in three people live in the nation\u2019s sole city, the capital Ulaan Baatar.\u201d The last places on Earth with no internet Palau The Queen has seen more of the South Pacific than you\u2019d care to mention. The Royal Yacht Britannia, decommissioned in 1997, enabled her to island hop in far-flung corners of the world with relative ease (for most ordinary travellers, a cruise ship is the way to go). But we\u2019ve uncovered four missing pieces to this paradisiac puzzle: Niue, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. The last of these probably has the most to offer. It is pure Bounty advert territory, with pristine beaches, world-class scuba diving, and forest-covered volcanic islands. At a glance | 91 places the Queen hasn't been So where does she go to relax? These aren\u2019t holidays, of course. They are working trips, filled with mundane sightseeing and dull dinners with dignitaries. So where does The Queen go to unwind? The Bahamas? Sardinia? Tuscany with the corgis? Of course not. \u201cThe Queen doesn't have holidays,\u201d Hugo Vickers, a royal historian, told the BBC back in 2012. \u201cShe goes to Balmoral.\u201d","published_at":1527679517,"content_id":"b55256d1-b982-3595-aeeb-338e96ac1523","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/well-travelled-queen-countries-visit-111932243.html","content_published_at":1527679172,"content_time":1527679172,"content_relative_time":55,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Royal

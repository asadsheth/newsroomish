It was simply too large. Another flightless fowl, a turkey, got the go-ahead two years ago to fly with its owner on Delta Air Lines. And then there was the mallard, wearing Velcro red shoes, that became an internet celebrity when the duck was photographed in 2016 flying with its caretaker in North Carolina. The animals that flew didn't cost their owners a dime and didn't spend their time locked up in a cage.

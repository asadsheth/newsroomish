Osteoarthritis is chronic joint inflammation that causes damage to articular cartilage \u2013 which covers and protects the ends of bones \u2013 as well as changes to synovial fluid and narrowing of the joint space. Because cartilage in an osteoarthritic joint is brittle, it cracks a little when the pet moves or jumps. The cartilage becomes thinner and less able to retain fluid.

U.S. Senator John Kennedy, who earlier on Wednesday sent a letter to United Airlines President Scott Kirby demanding information on the high number of animals that have died in the carrier's care, wrote on Twitter that he planned to file a bill on Thursday that would prohibit airlines from putting animals in overhead bins. Kennedy, in his letter, said United's \"pattern of animal deaths and injuries is simply inexcusable.\" He cited figures from the Transportation Department that of the 24 animals that died on U.S. carriers last year, 18 were on United flights.","published_at":1521472944,"content_id":"b91a4e11-7c8a-3f68-90db-dc0929c237e9","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/death-puppy-united-flight-prompts-220957335.html","content_published_at":1521065397,"content_time":1521065397,"content_relative_time":163,"reaction_count":4,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":163,"comment_relative_time":163,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

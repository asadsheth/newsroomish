The figures showed the area to be the third highest in the UK in terms of theft by population density, behind Lincolnshire and West Yorkshire. However, South Wales Police saw a 75% reduction in dog thefts last year. The UK-wide survey saw an overall increase of 25% in the crime, with 2,017 dogs stolen across England and Wales in 2017. One large haul in Carmarthenshire saw 15 West Highland terriers and King Charles spaniel puppies taken in October.","published_at":1523568765,"content_id":"24782089-beb3-3388-a4aa-bf4fff67c6f0","content_url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-wales-43745851","content_published_at":1523564243,"content_time":1523564243,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":25,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"35b47c10-83b0-39b5-a268-c98cc96c4faa","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-bbf50782-16e1-3be5-83da-cd0d55ae8c7b_a-35b47c10-83b0-39b5-a268-c98cc96c4faa","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-bbf50782-16e1-3be5-83da-cd0d55ae8c7b_a-35b47c10-83b0-39b5-a268-c98cc96c4faa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/taking-responsibility-oops-puppy-s4bz28r","author":"third_watch","provider":"Mercury News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/04\/11\/taking-responsibility-for-an-oops-puppy\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Taking responsibility for an 'oops' puppy","summary":"hax-column-adv180418 201804092042CAROLYN HAX COLUMN;(Advance for Wednesday, April 18, 2018, and thereafter.

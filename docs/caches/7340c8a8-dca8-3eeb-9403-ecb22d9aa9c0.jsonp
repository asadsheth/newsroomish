In ordinary times, it'd be weird to expect commentary from a U.S. president about the cancellation of a TV show. Not if the president is a game show host, of course. When Trump did offer his two cents, it was to chide ABC's Bob Iger for not addressing any of the \u201cHORRIBLE\u201d statements directed toward himself on the network.

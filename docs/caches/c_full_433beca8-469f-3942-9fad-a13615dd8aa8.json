The justices, in a 5-4 ruling with the court's conservatives in the majority, endorsed the legality of the growing practice by companies to compel workers to sign arbitration agreements waiving their right to bring class-action claims on various disputes, primarily over wages and hours. The ruling could apply more broadly to discrimination claims but the court did not explicitly address that issue.","published_at":1526911751,"content_id":"36903e77-5e21-30ec-8c96-fd387ac6d99b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-top-court-backs-companies-over-worker-class-141107855--finance.html","content_published_at":1526918500,"content_time":1526918500,"content_relative_time":1,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"President Trump","vibe_id":"433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":1,"comment_relative_time":1,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d0c953e8-60df-33d9-8089-67114db58eb5","post_id":"v-433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8_c-b8b81ae8-6048-3c20-8cc9-e65f9530043c_a-d0c953e8-60df-33d9-8089-67114db58eb5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8_c-b8b81ae8-6048-3c20-8cc9-e65f9530043c_a-d0c953e8-60df-33d9-8089-67114db58eb5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/president-trump\/v-433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8_c-b8b81ae8-6048-3c20-8cc9-e65f9530043c_a-d0c953e8-60df-33d9-8089-67114db58eb5","author":"nanook","provider":"The Independent","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-04-20\/102b4830-25c0-11e7-a66a-23957430fe89_latigre-indy-eagle-01.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mike-pompeo-threatens-iran-strongest-140500183.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/PY4oVsA09WpUdKYe01QaZw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/35963cc4892e1fea7712975dc0741685","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1pVsHY89WoxI6iJk18bAgA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NzY7dz03Njg7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/35963cc4892e1fea7712975dc0741685","height":576,"width":768,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/35963cc4892e1fea7712975dc0741685","imgw":768,"imgh":576,"title":"Mike Pompeo threatens Iran with \u2018strongest sanctions in history\u2019","summary":"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has threatened Iran with \u201cthe strongest sanctions in history\u201d and vowed to use all economic and military pressure to \"crush\" Tehran's operatives and proxies around the world. The threat comes just after President Donald Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement, which he deemed flawed because it did not keep Iran from testing ballistic missiles and would eventually expire. Mr Trump also argued that Iran was not in compliance with the basic goal of the deal \u2014 to restrict Iran from enriching weapons grade uranium \u2014 even though the US State Department and the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had both confirmed compliance repeatedly.","published_at":1526911500,"content_id":"d0c953e8-60df-33d9-8089-67114db58eb5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mike-pompeo-threatens-iran-strongest-140500183.html","content_published_at":1526911500,"content_time":1526911500,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"President Trump","vibe_id":"433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":2,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

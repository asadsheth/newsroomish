Authorities also identified pharmaceutical magnate Sherman and his wife, Honey, as the two people found dead in a north Toronto mansion Friday. Police call the deaths suspicious, but on Friday also said that there were no signs of forced entry and that they were not looking for any suspect. The Sherman family issued a statement Saturday urging police to conduct a \"thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation\" into the deaths and calling on the media to avoid speculating on the cause of the deaths. Canadian Business magazine recently estimated his worth at 4.77 billion Canadian dollars ($3.65 billion), making him the 15th richest person in the country. But the Shermans didn\u2019t flaunt their wealth. He drove beat-up cars. They recently put up their house for sale for 6.9 million Canadian dollars ($5.4 million), but the home is relatively modest for a billionaire. Flowers from mourners are seen outside the home of billionaire founder of Canadian pharmaceutical firm Apotex Inc., Barry Sherman and his wife Honey Credit: Chris Helgren\/Reuters Sherman founded Toronto-based Apotex Inc. in 1974 with two employees and turned the generic drugmaker into a company that now has 11,000 employees worldwide. The company released a statement Saturday paying tribute to its founder, praising both his philanthropic efforts and what it described as his vision for health care. The Shermans were among Canada\u2019s most generous philanthropists, and their deaths shocked Canadian high society and the country\u2019s Jewish community. The couple made numerous multimillion-dollar donations to hospitals, schools and charities and had buildings named in their honor. They hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Liberal Party fundraiser in 2015. Honey Sherman was sat on the boards of several civic groups, including Mount Sinai\u2019s Women\u2019s Auxiliary, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the International American Joint Distribution Committee.

Charlotte to attend nursery full time, allowing her parents to focus on royal duties","summary":"They moved back to London from Norfolk in order to increase their workload on behalf of the Queen. And now, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have signalled their intention to prioritise their official duties by enrolling their two-year-old daughter at a private nursery full time. Princess Charlotte is to attend the \u201ckind and gentle\u201d Willcocks Nursery School, which is barely half a mile from Kensington Palace, from January, seven hours a day, five days a week. The decision marks a significant departure from the way in which Prince George was introduced to the education system - attending a modestly-priced Montessori nursery school in Norfolk, where most parents get financial help to pay the fees, only part time. By comparison, Kensington Palace announced that Princess Charlotte, who has never previously attended any form of nursery or pre-school, would join Willocks, at which annual fees will exceed \u00a316,000 a year, full time. She will be enrolled in their morning school, lunchtime club and afternoon school, attending from 9am until 4pm, taking in her own packed lunch and joining activities including cooking, music and acting. The nursery accommodates 32 children aged between two and three quarters and five, meaning that Charlotte, who turns three in May, will be among the youngest. Willcocks Nursery School\u00a0 Credit: Kensington Palace The morning sessions, running from 9am until 12pm are five days a week while the lunchtime and afternoon sessions take place on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. Advice on the nursery\u2019s website suggests that lunch club is for children \u201cready for a longer learning session and for older children to prepare them for big school.\u201d while the afternoon session is aimed at the two and three-year-olds. The daily routine at the nursery, which is based in the church hall at Holy Trinity Church in Kensington, includes prayers and hymns and employs professional dance and French teachers. A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the Duke and Duchess thought Willcocks \u201can ideal first step\u201d for their daughter and that they were \u201cimpressed\u201d by the staff. The Willcocks Nursery School Credit: Zak Hussein\/Splash She also noted that when the Cambridges moved back to London from Norfolk it was to enable them to continue to increase their official work on behalf of The Queen and for the charities and causes they support. The Duchess\u2019s third baby is due in April and so it is understood the decision will also allow her to spend time bonding with the baby. Willcocks, which has an all-female staff, is described by Tatler as a \"hidden gem\" that \"flies under the radar\" and is attended by British children and \"chic foreigners\" alike, some of whom register their children at birth in order to ensure them a place. It is rated \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted because of the \u201cexceptional\u201d organisation of time and the staff's meticulous planning, which ensures \u201cno time is wasted.\u201d Meanwhile, the Cambridges released a new family photograph that features on their Christmas card.

Mr Jackson is married to Natasha Archer, the Duchess\u2019s stylist, and together, the couple have become trusted confidantes. While Mr Jackson has captured some of the family\u2019s biggest milestones, from Prince George\u2019s fourth birthday to his first day at school, Ms Archer is credited with persuading the Duchess to try a younger, more glamorous look, not to mention ditching the ubiquitous nude pumps. Ms Archer attended the prestigious Uppingham School before reading Hispanic Studies at Kings College and joining the royal household as a PA in 2007. She was one of the first people to arrive at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u2019s hospital when Prince George was born in July 2013, carrying a hanger bag believed to contain the blue and white polka dot dress the Duchess would later wear when she presented her son to the world. Chris Jackson and Natasha Archer Credit: David\/SilverHub\/REX\/Shutterstock Ms Archer was promoted to the role of stylist the following year and has since joined the royals on numerous foreign tours. Ms Archer got to know Mr Jackson on the royal couple\u2019s tour of Australia in April 2014 and they began dating upon their return. They got engaged last September and married at a lavish wedding in France in April. Jackson, who has won numerous awards, began photographing the royals for Getty 13 years ago. Dubbed \u201cgolden boy\u201d by the other royal photographers who rib him mercilessly, he is known for his discretion, carefully walking a difficult line between being a member of the \u201cpack\u201d and a trusted member of the inner circle. \u00a0Chris Jackson and Natasha Archer Credit: Richard Young\/REX\/Shutterstock As well as taking the first official portrait pictures of the Duke and Duchess after their wedding and before they went to Canada, he has done a lot of work with Prince Harry on projects including Sentebale in Lesotho, accompanying him during this year\u2019s Invictus Games in Toronto. Mr Jackson is often mistaken for the Duke of Cambridge during royal tours abroad and is known for being well-dressed and having a keen eye for fashion, which provides his rivals the perfect opportunity to have a joke at his expense. Although the epitome of discretion when it comes to the royals, Mr Jackson cannot resist showing off his glamorous wife, publishing scores of photographs of her online, once noting he was \u201cdefinitely punching above my weight\u201d.","published_at":1513625786,"content_id":"5c1ad966-6060-3717-937f-0b81d86ed83f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/princess-charlotte-attend-nursery-full-193626796.html","content_published_at":1513625786,"content_time":1513625786,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":4,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237","post_id":"v-6f281fa0-f130-3069-8bc9-35d52e0787ad_c-461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237_a-461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-6f281fa0-f130-3069-8bc9-35d52e0787ad_c-461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237_a-461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/AaronRodgers12\/v-6f281fa0-f130-3069-8bc9-35d52e0787ad_c-461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237_a-461e53ef-d44d-36d2-a0af-4f1245e06237","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/joe-callahan-signing-opens-possibility-225403598.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KF8jkc07NrfrMSJdnhbG3Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/477f2aed2689d0bb14f9fcce2de88812","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/B6N0wb4RaPhTOh_0K7.FTQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MzU7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/477f2aed2689d0bb14f9fcce2de88812","height":535,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/477f2aed2689d0bb14f9fcce2de88812","imgw":1024,"imgh":535,"title":"Joe Callahan\u2019s re-signing opens possibility of Packers shutting down Aaron Rodgers","summary":"The Packers are re-signing quarterback Joe Callahan to the 53-player roster, Rob Demovsky of ESPN reports.

percent of the snake's body mass. The Conservancy of Southwest Florida said Thursday that biologists conducting research at Collier-Seminole State Park in April 2015 found the 11-foot, 31.5-pound snake eating a 35-pound white-tailed deer. Biologist Ian Bartoszek said the invasive snake's kill is believed to be \"the largest python-to-prey ratio yet documented.\" He said the snake's meal was 111 percent of its own body mass. Bartoszek said the find represents evidence of the threat Burmese pythons pose to native wildlife. \"Imagine the potential consequences","published_at":1520005608,"content_id":"cea50017-5aaa-3a0a-8974-f35fe9dbc41b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Odd_News\/2018\/03\/02\/Burmese-python-found-eating-entire-white-tailed-deer\/7181520004378\/","content_published_at":1520005608,"content_time":1520005608,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":15,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":4,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e","post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e_a-1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e_a-1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/donald-trump\/v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e_a-1e9224e2-699a-3f5f-893b-d449d5e32c2e","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Deadline","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/president-trump-asked-chief-staff-054041828.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IlrYueS_nvf_5BSTv2nrdg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/2abf661ac994bac3e4cc88929f8cfb18","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5xJlsnfEIq9l2zsZdb43ZQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDAwO3c9MjU5Mjs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/2abf661ac994bac3e4cc88929f8cfb18","height":3000,"width":2592,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/2abf661ac994bac3e4cc88929f8cfb18","imgw":2592,"imgh":3000,"title":"President Trump Asked Chief Of Staff To Remove Ivanka And Jared Kushner \u2013 Report","summary":"A New York Times column by Maggie Haberman and Mark Landler claims President Donald Trump asked his chief of staff John Kelly for help in ousting first daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner from their advisory roles at the White House.

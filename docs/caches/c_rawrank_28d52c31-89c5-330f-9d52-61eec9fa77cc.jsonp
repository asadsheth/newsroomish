Nibiru believers claim the rogue planetary system, sometimes known as Planet X or Wormwood, enters from the far fringes of the solar system every few millennia. Despite being widely ridiculed, it appears as though a team of astronomers have given the theory some credibility with the discovery of a star system which intersected our own. In a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, a team of researchers from the US, Europe, Chile and South America have found a dim star which passed the outer boundaries of our solar system 70,000 years ago.

Io, along with moons Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto, proved to Earthlings that our pale blue dot was not the center of the universe, galaxy, or even the solar system, since these four satellites seemingly orbited Jupiter as opposed to us. While Galileo kept his observation secret for years to follow because of the Catholic Church at the time, his documentation of Io paved the way for some very strange findings concerning this moon in subsequent centuries. Referred to as Jupiter's \u201cpizza moon\u201d due to its bright and blotted landscape, Io has also been regarded as a moon of fire and ice since it resides in an utterly cold place in our solar system (nearly 400 million miles from the Sun), but, unlike Jupiter's other moons, it emits massive amounts of heat despite its small size.","published_at":1522134128,"content_id":"b925cc67-c491-3c4d-b406-4ff285fb8bce","content_url":"http:\/\/listverse.com\/2018\/03\/27\/10-out-of-this-world-facts-about-jupiters-moon-io\/","content_published_at":1522134000,"content_time":1522134000,"content_relative_time":59,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":59,"comment_relative_time":59,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"89e2fee9-2b2e-34d7-8a51-2c043c09c4e1","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-16930f65-e46e-32aa-b09c-b1f4e937630c_a-89e2fee9-2b2e-34d7-8a51-2c043c09c4e1","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-16930f65-e46e-32aa-b09c-b1f4e937630c_a-89e2fee9-2b2e-34d7-8a51-2c043c09c4e1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/great-american-eclipse-motion-interactive-36wrip5","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"astronomy.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/cs.astronomy.com\/asy\/b\/astronomy\/archive\/2018\/03\/26\/the-great-american-eclipse-in-motion.aspx","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"The Great American Eclipse in Motion - Interactive Star Charts, Planets, Meteors, Comets, Telescopes","summary":"During last year's total solar eclipse (also known as the Great American Eclipse), Matt Francis captured a series of wide- and narrow-angle images that he later spent dozens of hours balancing and merging into a single image.

NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold, along with cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev, successfully boarded the space station after a roughly two-day trip from Earth. The crew launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, located in Kazakhstan and took the trip in a Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft which has become the default mode of transportation for ISS travelers. The new members, which will spend over five months aboard the spacecraft, join NASA astronaut Scott Tingle, Roscosmos cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, and Norishige Kanai of Japan's space agency, JAXA, as the full six-member team for Expedition 55. The lengthy trip between Earth an the International Space Station has less to do with distance and more to do with the careful maneuvering required for the crew capsule to successfully dock with the orbiting laboratory. Now that their journey is over, the scientists can get down to work, and there's plenty of it to go around. According to NASA, the crew has roughly 250 experiments and investigations to conduct during their stay aboard the ISS. They'll be dabbling in \"biology, Earth science, human research, physical sciences and technology development,\" NASA says. \"Highlights of upcoming investigations include:\u00a0a new facility\u00a0to test materials, coatings and components of other large experiments in the harsh environment of space,\" NASA explains. \"A study on the effects of microgravity on\u00a0bone marrow\u00a0and blood cells produced in bone marrow; and a newly-developed passive\u00a0nutrient delivery system\u00a0for the\u00a0Veggie\u00a0plant growth facility.\" Much of the work being performed on the International Space Station is forward-looking, and new discoveries can and will be applied to future space missions, including proposed journeys to Mars. More specifically, research into the effects of long-term stays in space will have a huge impact on how NASA and other space agencies around the world plan for manned missions to other planets. Recently, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and his twin brother, Mark, were the subject of the \"Twins Experiment\" which sought to determine how space can alter the genes of individuals during long trips. Despite some confusion on the topic, NASA revealed that the expression of Scott's genes had indeed undergone a long-lasting change, which could be a vital area of research going forward.","published_at":1522084890,"content_id":"280c0f55-34a7-3c25-95e3-8d68090e4758","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/international-space-station-gets-three-residents-expedition-55-183443114.html","content_published_at":1522089283,"content_time":1522089283,"content_relative_time":71,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":71,"comment_relative_time":71,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-9895a7fa-fd40-3732-9942-f451968dc336_a-9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-9895a7fa-fd40-3732-9942-f451968dc336_a-9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/guess-rich-people-meteor-showers-3abqy79","author":"nanook","provider":"Futurism","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/futurism.com\/meteor-showers-demand-rich-people\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IsNW3eqf7EHWi.mkxyyh5g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b5ZJtanI14GDzoN2AGICsw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e--2109553129.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E15UUCFeZKZXInSiWBg6FQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b5ZJtanI14GDzoN2AGICsw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e--2109553129.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b5ZJtanI14GDzoN2AGICsw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e--2109553129.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"Guess what, rich people: meteor showers on demand are a terrible idea","summary":"To glimpse a meteor shower, sometimes you've got to wake up in the middle of the night, bundle up against frigid cold, and wait many minutes or hours.

(@Fraunhofer_FHRe) March 27, 2018 As the days have passed, the ESA has been coming out with new date ranges for the descent. The most recent range marks the most precise prediction for re-entry so far. That said, we still don't know where Tiangong-1 will end up coming down.\u00a0 The space station \u2014 which launched to orbit in 2011 \u2014 will circle the Earth dozens of times over the course of the weekend, before the station is expected to re-enter. Because of that, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint where the station will come down.\u00a0 However, this uncertainty shouldn't be cause for concern.\u00a0 First of all, the space station should mostly burn up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere, but even if parts of the station do make it all the way to the planet's surface, the likelihood that they would land in a populated area is exceedingly small.\u00a0 According to astronomer Jonathan McDowell, trackers won't be able to rule out Tiangong-1 landing in certain areas until the window is down to around 12 hours.\u00a0 Worldwide unique radar images of Tiangong-1!Researchers at Fraunhofer FHR monitor re-entry of Chinese space station Tiangong-1 #reentry #Tiangong1 #radar #radarimage #spacedebris https:\/\/t.co\/WtVSR6omIt pic.twitter.com\/QBCit0dp3v \u2014 Fraunhofer FHR engl.

Tiangong-1 was visited by taikonauts \u2014 Chinese astronauts \u2014 twice over the course of its life.

In dense strands, gas making up the filaments tends to gather in clumps due to gravitational interactions. If dense enough, material can collapse, heat up and form new stars. In relatively nearby star-forming regions, within about 1,500 light years of the Sun, the filaments appear to be roughly the same width, about a third of a light year across, suggesting a common mechanism in their origin. The filaments and stars seen here are in the Carina neighborhood some 7,500 light years from the","published_at":1522094808,"content_id":"c81fd61b-482d-3307-8ecb-4bc1b21cb9ca","content_url":"https:\/\/astronomynow.com\/2018\/03\/26\/glowing-stellar-nurseries-in-a-web-of-cosmic-filaments\/","content_published_at":1522047600,"content_time":1522047600,"content_relative_time":58,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":58,"comment_relative_time":58,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b6f6fdd1-c2d4-3337-8d82-d5ab0645ce72","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-05dbb0bf-22f0-309c-bf82-649c57b5fd36_a-b6f6fdd1-c2d4-3337-8d82-d5ab0645ce72","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-05dbb0bf-22f0-309c-bf82-649c57b5fd36_a-b6f6fdd1-c2d4-3337-8d82-d5ab0645ce72","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-carved-6citvdt","author":"nanook","provider":"Mail Online","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-5544877\/SpaceX-Falcon-9-rocket-carved-record-setting-hole-Earths-atmosphere.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3FmIcDOjB9XV3M2Prm.VSw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2kS8RngPZvZqq0jTLabgQA--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b6f6fdd1-c2d4-3337-8d82-d5ab0645ce72-1324273171.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eKRnP0_VDfLR4FNo2LFTXw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODI7dz02MzY7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2kS8RngPZvZqq0jTLabgQA--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b6f6fdd1-c2d4-3337-8d82-d5ab0645ce72-1324273171.jpeg","height":382,"width":636,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2kS8RngPZvZqq0jTLabgQA--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b6f6fdd1-c2d4-3337-8d82-d5ab0645ce72-1324273171.jpeg","imgw":636,"imgh":382,"title":"SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carved a huge hole in Earth's atmosphere","summary":"A recent SpaceX rocket flight punched an enormous hole in Earth's atmosphere, according to new research.

The record-setting puncture was akin to a localised magnetic storm and may have caused disruptions to GPS systems on Earth, experts said.

NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold, along with cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev, successfully boarded the space station after a roughly two-day trip from Earth. The crew launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, located in Kazakhstan and took the trip in a Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft which has become the default mode of transportation for ISS travelers. The new members, which will spend over five months aboard the spacecraft, join NASA astronaut Scott Tingle, Roscosmos cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, and Norishige Kanai of Japan's space agency, JAXA, as the full six-member team for Expedition 55. The lengthy trip between Earth an the International Space Station has less to do with distance and more to do with the careful maneuvering required for the crew capsule to successfully dock with the orbiting laboratory. Now that their journey is over, the scientists can get down to work, and there's plenty of it to go around. According to NASA, the crew has roughly 250 experiments and investigations to conduct during their stay aboard the ISS. They'll be dabbling in \"biology, Earth science, human research, physical sciences and technology development,\" NASA says. \"Highlights of upcoming investigations include:\u00a0a new facility\u00a0to test materials, coatings and components of other large experiments in the harsh environment of space,\" NASA explains. \"A study on the effects of microgravity on\u00a0bone marrow\u00a0and blood cells produced in bone marrow; and a newly-developed passive\u00a0nutrient delivery system\u00a0for the\u00a0Veggie\u00a0plant growth facility.\" Much of the work being performed on the International Space Station is forward-looking, and new discoveries can and will be applied to future space missions, including proposed journeys to Mars. More specifically, research into the effects of long-term stays in space will have a huge impact on how NASA and other space agencies around the world plan for manned missions to other planets. Recently, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and his twin brother, Mark, were the subject of the \"Twins Experiment\" which sought to determine how space can alter the genes of individuals during long trips. Despite some confusion on the topic, NASA revealed that the expression of Scott's genes had indeed undergone a long-lasting change, which could be a vital area of research going forward.","published_at":1522084890,"content_id":"280c0f55-34a7-3c25-95e3-8d68090e4758","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/international-space-station-gets-three-residents-expedition-55-183443114.html","content_published_at":1522089283,"content_time":1522089283,"content_relative_time":46,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":46,"comment_relative_time":46,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e","post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-9895a7fa-fd40-3732-9942-f451968dc336_a-9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-9895a7fa-fd40-3732-9942-f451968dc336_a-9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/guess-rich-people-meteor-showers-3abqy79","author":"nanook","provider":"Futurism","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/futurism.com\/meteor-showers-demand-rich-people\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IsNW3eqf7EHWi.mkxyyh5g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b5ZJtanI14GDzoN2AGICsw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e--2109553129.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E15UUCFeZKZXInSiWBg6FQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b5ZJtanI14GDzoN2AGICsw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e--2109553129.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b5ZJtanI14GDzoN2AGICsw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9e66f64f-f9c9-3f3e-9e6a-30d6bb5c949e--2109553129.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"Guess what, rich people: meteor showers on demand are a terrible idea","summary":"To glimpse a meteor shower, sometimes you've got to wake up in the middle of the night, bundle up against frigid cold, and wait many minutes or hours.

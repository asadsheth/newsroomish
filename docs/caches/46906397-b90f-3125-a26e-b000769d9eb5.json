Still, it doesn't have to be an either\/or situation. As Pixar focuses on original movies, like its intriguing suburban fantasy movie, the studio can still revisit beloved properties or ones that deserve a second crack or have more story to tell. After all, if Pixar only made original movies and eschewed sequels entirely, we would have been denied Toy Story 2 and 3, arguably one of the greatest trilogies in the history of cinema. So with that in mind, it's worth looking at which of Pixar's remaining standalone films need a sequel and which ones absolutely do not.","published_at":1528825978,"content_id":"5b43caf9-3c96-35aa-91d5-9e096861ea7d","content_url":"https:\/\/amp.cinemablend.com\/news\/2434070\/4-pixar-movies-that-need-a-sequel-and-4-that-absolutely-dont","content_published_at":1528825230,"content_time":1528825230,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-bd890415-f0c8-3bfb-b58d-10d3dc55d1c3_a-1c1a5def-03cf-3846-915a-7585d89110f7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/helios-matheson-hmny-keeps-investors-drpcmaw","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Investopedia","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/08\/investopedia-106x27_142340.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/investing\/helios-and-matheson-hmny-keeps-investors-edge-their-seats\/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Helios and Matheson (HMNY) Keeps Investors at the Edge of Their Seats","summary":"MoviePass, a concept that has turned the moviegoer experience into a monthly subscription, has been in the news lately.

So what happened? Well, Raimi didn't get to make the movie he wanted to. As with so many superhero movies, the studio inserted itself into the film's making a little too much, insisting that the villain Venom be in the movie, which already had two villains that Raimi wanted to work with \u2014 the Sandman and Harry Osborn (who becomes the second Green Goblin after his father's death in the first film). Raimi's trilogy had been working toward Harry's eventual transformation, and Sandman played to Raimi's interests and strengths as a horror filmmaker.

Not necessarily knowing how tall Sylvester Stallone was in real life, it was shocking to see Hogan tower above his co-star and toss him around the ring in Rocky III. It spawned research to learn that Hulk Hogan was, in real life, a man that stood 6-foot-7 and weighed over 300 pounds, a behemoth by any standard. No sooner was that discovery made, though, than one would inevitably see Hulk Hogan standing next to a man who made him look as small as Thunderlips made Rocky look. Back then, it was easy to enjoy and be amazed by Andre the Giant, but it was impossible to process how he could be real.","published_at":1523316740,"content_id":"660fa844-c179-32f6-af1e-d33940ed2d2a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/review\/andre-giant-review-1100653","content_published_at":1523305137,"content_time":1523305137,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-e6173bdf-04cc-3bf1-a771-d8f8674b0a4a_a-4245e26f-40e2-38dd-a5a9-6273d0dba80b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/james-bonds-costume-designer-made-mtuf71y","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"CINEMABLEND","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2400312\/how-james-bonds-costume-designer-made-the-women-more-feminist","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/L73YP.Kia.LquORh3of7bA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7uUwMAwnLm0.u6KFcBhG_Q--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4245e26f-40e2-38dd-a5a9-6273d0dba80b-1738187588.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qFgM89Urt.t2AoXVUk200w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7uUwMAwnLm0.u6KFcBhG_Q--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4245e26f-40e2-38dd-a5a9-6273d0dba80b-1738187588.jpeg","height":300,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7uUwMAwnLm0.u6KFcBhG_Q--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4245e26f-40e2-38dd-a5a9-6273d0dba80b-1738187588.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":300,"title":"How James Bond's Costume Designer Made The Women More Feminist","summary":"When it comes to the James Bond movies, there are a couple things you can always count on. 007 is one of Great Britain's best spies, he enjoys a good shaken martini and he'll either work alongside or face off against a beautiful woman. But society has changed quite a bit in since the first James Bond movie, Dr. No, was released in 1962, and in the case of the Bond ladies, what they wore in the early 1960s wouldn't necessarily work well in one of the modern movies.

As many know by now, 2016's\u00a0Rogue One featured a CGI recreation of the late Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, and the final scene starred a digitally de-aged Carrie Fisher as the 19-year old Princess Leia from\u00a0A New Hope.

set reveal a new look at Lashana Lynch in character as, well, we're not sure yet as details of who she's playing have been kept under wraps so far.

If you'll recall, Lynch was a late-in-the-day replacement for DeWanda Wise, who had to drop out of\u00a0Captain Marvel\u00a0due to scheduling conflicts with her TV show\u00a0She's Gotta Have It.

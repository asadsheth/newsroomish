Long before Gareth Edwards and Legendary\u00a0Pictures created the MonsterVerse with 2014's Godzilla, TriStar Pictures tried their hand at an American adaptation of the Japanese classic.

Chances are you hadn't seen countless previews and TV spots or read a lot of articles prior to seeing a movie, as the information you had to go on was limited and might have only been one trailer or a poster. So selling a movie to audiences was a different exercise, and when something new and original came along, there was a need to explain it to audiences. That was the case with some early concept posters for Star Wars shared by Mark Hamill.

Let's face it: World War Z, no matter how much money it made, was a failure. Turning a massively scoped story of the zombie apocalypse, in all of its bloody, violent glory, into a PG-13 summer blockbuster was the first mistake that the 2013 film made. The second mistake was to hand the film to a director like Marc Forster, who, while being able to handle more personal films quite well, isn't exactly the most stable hands to give an action-packed spectacular as World War Z. Which brings us to the film's greatest failing: it failed to bring author Max Brooks' original, episodic vision to life in a way that honored the source material.","published_at":1527640183,"content_id":"6bae70db-91f0-3b79-9121-94e7a819d5ab","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2427111\/its-time-to-pull-the-plug-on-world-war-z-2","content_published_at":1527638341,"content_time":1527638341,"content_relative_time":41,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-93867b93-3d98-35cf-871c-1bd721a6cac2_a-c9a8e496-1d38-32c4-a8c2-44149307553a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/vertical-acquires-relationship-mucho-mas-35firx3","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Deadline","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.deadline.com","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/423\/2012\/03\/29\/deadline-logo-jpg_163144.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/vertical-acquires-relationship-mucho-mas-000005440.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.OBB9nkJraLqyS6kif4k6Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/aa79e60509011911f99eef4b97374acf","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yvj86Eb462icwit_9zZ8lA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDEwO3c9NTc2MDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/aa79e60509011911f99eef4b97374acf","height":3010,"width":5760,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/aa79e60509011911f99eef4b97374acf","imgw":5760,"imgh":3010,"title":"Vertical Acquires \u2018In A Relationship\u2019; Mucho Mas Media, 2 Friends Media Launch Inclusion \u2013 Film Briefs","summary":"Vertical Entertainment has obtained the North American distribution rights to Emma Roberts-starring film\u00a0 In a Relationship, written and directed by first-time filmmaker Sam Boyd. \u00a0The comedy, which had its world premiere this year at the Tribeca, also stars Michael Angarano, Dree Hemingway, and Patrick Gibson.

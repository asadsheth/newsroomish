A totally new\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0trilogy replete with original characters that will presumably exist in its own little corner of that galaxy far, far away \u2013 and therefore remain independent from the\u00a0other\u00a0trilogy in the works from David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the current showrunners behind HBO's\u00a0Game of Thrones.

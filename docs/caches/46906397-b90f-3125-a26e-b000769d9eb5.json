The young actress and musician came to television prominence playing Enid on the AMC zombie apocalypse series. A TV-original character, Enid was initially a minor figure on The Walking Dead and played love interest to young Carl Grimes, however more recent episodes have seen her develop deeper relationships with the likes of Maggie and Aaron and Enid has gained more screen time as a result. After Carl's shocking death, Enid could be set to become an even more important character, as showrunners have promised Carl's comic storylines would be played out with other characters.","published_at":1527602239,"content_id":"1360b052-8330-3add-817a-4be3384158c1","content_url":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/batgirl-dceu-katelyn-nacon\/","content_published_at":1527570000,"content_time":1527570000,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-9932adf4-20f4-3663-80bd-8edae1751f0b_a-5d4ea2cb-ef04-34e4-9a90-2f572ebda40a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/zack-snyder-next-movie-fountainhead-tptv4gv","author":"nanook","provider":"Vulture","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2015-11-30\/6733ce30-977e-11e5-96ac-612aa29c4684_60bc9cfaf2c385aa0ca455932e522781.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/zack-snyder-next-movie-fountainhead-133809948.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cnm36J7Bd.KKOlqiDvcAtA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nymag_com_989\/31235486ef65962f901da86bf6b6b711","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DNFEUoKKhTbdNevXf8nBBA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjAwO3c9MTE0MTs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nymag_com_989\/31235486ef65962f901da86bf6b6b711","height":1600,"width":1141,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nymag_com_989\/31235486ef65962f901da86bf6b6b711","imgw":1141,"imgh":1600,"title":"Zack Snyder\u2019s Next Movie Will Be The Fountainhead","summary":"Snyder will skip his Afghanistan thriller for now.","published_at":1527601391,"content_id":"5d4ea2cb-ef04-34e4-9a90-2f572ebda40a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/zack-snyder-next-movie-fountainhead-133809948.html","content_published_at":1527601089,"content_time":1527601089,"content_relative_time":7,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-7fd28f34-aad3-3ec0-bb37-db983f678767_a-947d5439-88ac-337b-b82e-2d38dff16460","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/star-wars-avoid-franchise-fatigue-1kwo9z3","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Den of Geek","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\/us\/movies\/star-wars\/273799\/how-star-wars-can-avoid-franchise-fatigue","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RNJtNBIvg3taHts81mD37Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IuTbo_vVKZqkC7cxNJ_7vQ--\/dz05NzA7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_947d5439-88ac-337b-b82e-2d38dff16460--338205672.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Q79e3ns7XSMZR1e82mzmzQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NDU7dz05NzA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IuTbo_vVKZqkC7cxNJ_7vQ--\/dz05NzA7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_947d5439-88ac-337b-b82e-2d38dff16460--338205672.jpeg","height":545,"width":970,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/IuTbo_vVKZqkC7cxNJ_7vQ--\/dz05NzA7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_947d5439-88ac-337b-b82e-2d38dff16460--338205672.jpeg","imgw":970,"imgh":545,"title":"How Star Wars can avoid franchise fatigue","summary":"This article comes from Den of Geek UK. Spoilers for Rogue One lie ahead specifically, but also we talk openly about plot threads in the other Star Wars films too. I waited through fallow years for new Star Wars movies, suspecting they'd never come. Yet, four films into the Disney's run I'm almost at the point where I don't care if I don't see another. Colour me happy that we're getting another shortish quiet spell before Episode IX. I need a break. Now, as Lucasfilm's brain trust works to revisit another dead character, in another prequel-in-all-but-name, I think it's worthwhile looking at the ways I think it can avoid franchise fatigue and potentially burning itself out. 1.

Dern has recently come to specialize in standout supporting roles, but she takes the lead in The Tale, directed by Jennifer Fox and based on Fox's own experiences. Dern plays Jennifer, a documentary filmmaker forced to reevaluate her past and interrogate her own memories when her mother (Ellen Burstyn) unearths a creative-writing assignment Jennifer wrote at 13, a thinly veiled account of the sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of a track coach (Jason Ritter) with the cooperation of a trusted riding instructor (Elizabeth Debicki).","published_at":1527513371,"content_id":"8a3efa9c-5b1f-3d95-aae6-df1e0afbd777","content_url":"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2018\/05\/how-wild-at-heart-changed-everything-for-laura-dern.html","content_published_at":1527512402,"content_time":1527512402,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-7371ba67-6f93-367e-862f-97dbe9d2fab6_a-6f5e6ea9-2585-3678-b5e5-8f50fc9a1d37","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/romanian-actor-vlad-ivanov-seeking-427gj4j","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Variety","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/variety.com\/2018\/film\/news\/romanian-actor-vlad-ivanov-1202823501\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bEBEFklwEvyYNTgdC9regg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_zyfojr4ed.wkIYZy30Z2Q--\/dz03MDA7aD0zOTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6f5e6ea9-2585-3678-b5e5-8f50fc9a1d37--501263595.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1IW2sHuRE7sk_CTuJPu93w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTM7dz03MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_zyfojr4ed.wkIYZy30Z2Q--\/dz03MDA7aD0zOTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6f5e6ea9-2585-3678-b5e5-8f50fc9a1d37--501263595.jpeg","height":393,"width":700,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_zyfojr4ed.wkIYZy30Z2Q--\/dz03MDA7aD0zOTM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6f5e6ea9-2585-3678-b5e5-8f50fc9a1d37--501263595.jpeg","imgw":700,"imgh":393,"title":"Romanian Actor Vlad Ivanov on Seeking Out Roles with Fresh Challenges","summary":"Romanian actor Vlad Ivanov is known to many abroad for his role as the amoral underground abortionist in \u201c4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,\u201d the 2007 Cristian Mungiu film that heralded the country's New Wave when it won in Cannes.

A Christmas Prince, which hit the streaming service earlier this month, has quickly become infamous across social media, with fans celebrating its unintentional badness, baffling plot and dodgy acting. Playing like a mix of The Prince & Me, Never Been Kissed and The Princess Diaries, the film stars Rose McIver as an head-scratchingly unskilled New York reporter\u00a0sent to cover a royal press conference in the fictional European country of Aldovia. While there she goes undercover as a tutor for the\u00a0disabled sister of a \"playboy prince\", falls in love with the prince and unearths a royal scandal. Riffing on the film's bad press, which had spread to sites including Buzzfeed and Entertainment Weekly,\u00a0Netflix exposed some of the film's biggest fans on Twitter yesterday, tweeting: \"To the 53 people who've watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?\" Christmas movies Netflix (December 2017) While some found the tweet funny, others were more critical of what it suggested: that an incredibly successful global corporation that traditionally keeps its user data under lock and key would then use that data for comedic purposes. \"I liked this tweet because it's good to be reminded that huge unaccountable companies use our personal data to dunk on us both literally and figuratively,\" wrote New York Times tech journalist Kevin Roose.

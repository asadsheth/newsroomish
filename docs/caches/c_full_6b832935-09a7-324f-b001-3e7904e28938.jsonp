Meghan Markle's\u00a0extended family has hit the headlines repeatedly\u00a0over the past few months, with one newspaper describing it as a \"motley collection of individuals who, between them, have a long record of boozing, bust-ups and bankruptcies\". Yet Meghan Markle is close to her \"free-spirited\" mother Dori Ragland\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who is still expected to travel with Ms Markle to the church on Saturday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and her \"thoughtful, inspiring\" father, with the\u00a0actress having written lovingly of her relationship with both her parents.

She now lives in the house she inherited from her father in 2011 in the Crenshaw area of LA. Ms Ragland\u00a0and her daughter are extremely close - Ms Ragland once drove a car with the number plate MEGNME - and Ms Markle has spoken of her pride in her free-spirited mother, with her dreadlocks and nose ring. Ms Ragland is due to travel with her daughter to the ceremony on Saturday,\u00a0travelling from their overnight accommodation at Cliveden House Hotel\u00a0to St George\u2019s Chapel by car. Thomas Markle, Meghan's father Born in Pennsylvania, of Dutch-Irish descent, Thomas Markle Snr, 72, made his way to Hollywood where he worked as a lighting director. He worked for many years on the set of the television show Married With Children, and his work on long-running series General Hospital earned him nine Daytime Emmy nominations, of which he was twice named the winner.

Since retiring, Mr Markle moved to Mexico. He was declared bankrupt in June 2016.\u00a0Miss Markle has described her father as the \"most hardworking father you can imagine\".

The wedding plans have since been called into question, as Mr Markle was to walk his daughter down the aisle on Saturday.

After enrolling at Northwestern University in Illinois, Spanish speaker Meghan travelled to Argentina for her senior year in 2003. She completed a double major in Theatre and International Relations. \"So I'm 20 years old, in Buenos Aires, in a motorcade, doing that whole thing. I thought for sure I would still have a career in politics,\u201d she told Vogue a decade later. In an interview with the Mirror earlier this year, Michael spoke of his role in the process. \u201cI knew the ambassador, and I asked him if he could help, as her application was a little on the late side,\u201d he said. As a result, he was surprised not to be invited to his niece\u2019s wedding. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she has been so indifferent towards me. It\u2019s uncalled for. I helped her out, and I didn\u2019t ask for anything in return. This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I never did anything to embarrass Meghan. It seems to me they handled the arrangements poorly.\u201d Michael has a 58-year-old daughter, Trish Gallup, \u00a0who runs her own\u00a0who runs her own chauffeur business. Frederick Markle Meghan\u2019s other paternal uncle, Frederick, is a reclusive cleric who also lives in Florida.

Samantha Markle has lashed out at her half-sister, Meghan, in several interviews Credit: Splash News\u00a0 She also caused a stir in April when she announced she was writing a book entitled\u00a0The Diary of Princess Pushy\u2019s Sister.

Markle Snr now wants to come to Meghan and Harry's wedding - if his health allows","summary":"The circus surrounding\u00a0the Royal wedding has taken yet another twist as it emerged Thomas Markle Snr has had a change of mind about attending.\u00a0 Meghan Markle's father was reportedly set to snub the Royals in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding paparazzi photographs.\u00a0 As bookmakers took odds on who would replace him to walk the bride-to-be down the aisle, Mr Markle talked from his hospital bed about his desire to be present on the momentous day. American gossip website TMZ claim to have talked to the former actress' father who is said to be recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week. It is claimed Meghan, 36, tried to contact her father on Monday, but that he was away from his phone. She followed it up with a text, according to TMZ, saying she loved him and that there were no ill feelings.\u00a0 He told the website: \"I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle. Of course I'd walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I'd like to be a part of history.\"\u00a0 Mr Markle is said to insisted if doctors allow him to leave his bed, he will risk his health to fly to England before Saturday. The American former actress's half-sister, Samantha Markle, said she hoped Thomas Markle would be at the ceremony, but that he had faced an \"unbelievable amount of stress\". She told Good Morning Britain that Mr Markle had health issues, \u00a0had had chest pains and had suffered a heart attack. But it was not clear whether doctors had diagnosed a need for medical emergency. \"I think he wants to go to the hospital and get checked out,\" she said. \"I don't know as of today what his plans are, but there's a very real concern. I wanted to see him go (to the wedding), I didn't want him deprived of that. \"But clearly the priority should be whether or not it's safe for him to do that. That's where we're at.\" Markle family Mr Markle became embroiled in controversy after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the nuptials at Windsor Castle. Celebrity website TMZ claimed Mr Markle had initially decided not to go to the wedding for fear of embarrassing his daughter following the fallout from the pictures. Kensington Palace declined to confirm whether\u00a0Mr Markle had pulled out of attending but appealed for understanding. A palace spokesman said: \"This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. \"She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.\" Samantha Markle defended Mr Markle, saying he had been pressurised into a dangerous situation because of press intrusion. \"He was living a very quiet, peaceful life, not as a recluse. He's a very intelligent man. He's been gregarious and worked in entertainment for 40 years,\" she said. \"He had spoken with press and was doing just that, but when he called me, panicking on the freeway because he's in a dangerous situation being followed by seven or eight cars, I think there have been examples in history of how dangerous that can be.\" Royal wedding countdown in pictures as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's preparations begin She earlier attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she tweeted that it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as \"positive photos\" in a bid to combat his \"bad\" portrayal in the press, but insisted it was not done for money. Pictures published earlier this month in newspapers and websites showed Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding-related activities such as being fitted for a suit, apparently unaware he was being snapped. The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported that the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress's father in the internet cafe with a photographer. Royal wedding PREMIUM GRID The former TV lighting director was due to meet the Queen and other royals with Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, this week ahead of the wedding. Meghan's father met her mother on the set of the US soap General Hospital, where he worked as a lighting director when she was a temp in the studio. They divorced when Meghan was six. Ms Ragland is being tipped to step in and accompany her daughter down the aisle if Mr Markle does not attend. Meghan's extended family arrive in London - without invites Meghan Markle's extended family arrived in London with seemingly no invite to the big day.\u00a0 With the constant speculation over whether or not her father would attend the ceremony,\u00a0her nephews' arrival with their mother heaps more embarrassment on the American actress, 36. Tracy Dooley - who was married to Meghan Markle's half-brother\u00a0Thomas Markle Jr - was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25,\u00a0and Thomas, 26. Ms Dooley\u00a0has previously told ITV's Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday, admitting she had not seen Ms Markle for 20 years. She is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she \"will be in the front row cheering them on\" in Windsor. The Dooleys took to Facebook to announce their presence in the capital on Monday evening. Meghan Markle's nephews Tyler and Thomas Dooley and their mother Tracy Dooley Markle arrive at Heathrow airport with an unidentified woman Credit: Constant Media Ms Dooley posted pictures of landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye, writing: \"We're here.\u00a0Yay.\" Her son Tyler uploaded an image of the Imperial War Museum, as well as a photograph of the inside of a hotel room. \"Just touched down in London. Man,\u00a0what a journey so far,\" he wrote. \"We're safe and sound.\" Ms Dooley lives in Medford, Oregon, according to her Facebook, but is originally from Calabasas in California.\u00a0 She is listed as a creative advertising and marketing specialist at Opus Broadcasting - a company responsible for a handful of radio stations, according to its website.\u00a0 On May 3, she shared a link to her personal blog, saying she was travelling to London to \"cover all things Royal wedding\". Upon the family's arrival, the Facebook blog page - called Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles - posted a picture of the trio landing at Heathrow with the caption: \"Just glad to have landed safely and hoping for Tom senior to be well, healthy and\u00a0happy. \"I wish the same for Meghan, Prince Harry, my children, friends, family and those who need our prayers and love. Peace, love and good works.\" In April, the blog's page, which appears to be run by Ms Dooley, shared an article headlined \"Meghan Markle snubs nephew and his\u00a0mum with no invite to Royal

Ragland, Meghan Markle's mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be? \u00a0","summary":"After Meghan Markle's father\u00a0pulled out of the Royal Wedding, it has raised the question of who will walk her down the aisle on Saturday. Thomas Markle, 73, said he would no longer be flying to Britain, after embarrassing disclosures about his dealings with the paparazzi. It is thought the role will now fall to the mother of the bride, Doria Ragland, who will be attending the wedding. Other contenders include members of the Royal Family and friends of Prince Harry. As Mr Markle has pulled out of the ceremony, and according to TMZ will not be performing his other duties as father of the bride, there are many gaps in the proceedings. Thomas and Meghan Markle Credit: \u00a0TIM STEWART NEWS LIMITED It is unknown who will give a speech at the evening dinner - this role may also fall to her mother. Before the ceremony at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel, Mr Markle was expected to perform another duty organised by engaged couples around the globe, the meeting of the in-laws. The former lighting director and his ex-wife were due to sit down to tea with the Queen and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. Royal wedding | Read more It would be an informal chat where the ice would be broken and the two families could get to know one another, albeit in the likely setting of Buckingham Palace. Mr Markle's absence is unlikely to be filled by another family member and it will be down to Ms\u00a0Ragland\u00a0to represent both of them. Markle family Who will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle?\u00a0 Doria Ragland Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland Credit: \u00a0REUTERS\/Mark Blinch\/File Photo\u00a0 Meghan Markle's mother is the most likely contender to walk her down the aisle after her father pulled out. According to TMZ, Thomas Markle has given his ex-wife his blessing to perform the duty. As she is a committed and proud feminist, this break from tradition is unlikely to bother the bride.

Ladbrokes odds: 4\/6 Prince Charles Prince Charles may have to fulfill the role Credit: ARIS MESSINIS\/AFP\/Getty Images If Doria Ragland is not able to walk her daughter down the aisle, another option is the father of the groom, Prince Charles. The Prince of Wales has expressed his excitement about the wedding, telling reporters in Nice, France last week: \"It's absolutely marvellous. It's going to be a very special day for everybody.\" Ladbrokes odds: 2\/1 The Duke of Cambridge The two get along well Credit: EDDIE MULHOLLAND\/AFP\/Getty Images Prince William may be on hand to walk his brother's bride down the aisle. He would likely be a good source of support for Meghan Markle, as the two have conducted Royal engagements together and appear to get along well. The Duke of Cambridge has also been through the pressure of a very public Royal Wedding, so would perhaps be able to calm any jangled nerves. Ladbrokes odds:\u00a0\u00a05\/1 Guy Pelly Violet Von Westenholz, the matchmaker behind the Royal couple, at a Tatler party with Prince Harry's friend Guy Pelly An admittedly long shot, but if the couple do not pick a family member, a friend of Prince Harry may be a good bet. Guy Pelly has been a friend of the Prince and his brother since they were children, and is connected to the matchmaker who set the Royal couple up on their first date. He is friends with\u00a0Violet Von Westenholz, who the Telegraph revealed as the Cupid who brought the pair together. Mr Pelly and Ms Westenholz\u00a0have for years been photographed together at parties.

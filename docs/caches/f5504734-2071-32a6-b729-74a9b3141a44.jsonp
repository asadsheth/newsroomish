Many Haitians sought asylum in Canada based on expectations that they would easily be granted refugee status, the government said, leading lawmakers to reach out to diaspora communities to dispel such misinformation.","published_at":1515614871,"content_id":"c3e5b24c-fe95-328d-a4cd-2593664e509f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/canada-telling-salvadorans-facing-u-exit-haven-isnt-205139854.html","content_published_at":1515617499,"content_time":1515617499,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-4a37a42b-3b54-3bab-a480-a33a0623081f_a-d0033993-d79c-3b1f-8b5e-784822176986","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/airline-stocks-rise-american-airlines-5xw5ept","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/airline-stocks-rise-american-airlines-191741603.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Airline stocks rise on American Airlines' upbeat forecast","summary":"U.S. airline stocks rose after American Airlines Group Inc on Wednesday became the second major airline this week to forecast higher unit revenue for the fourth quarter.

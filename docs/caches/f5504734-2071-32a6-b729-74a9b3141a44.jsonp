Trump halts Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm","summary":"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd's proposed takeover of Qualcomm Inc on national security grounds, ending what would have been the technology industry's biggest deal ever amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in mobile communications. The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States' lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official.","published_at":1520937604,"content_id":"d3fb96d6-a633-3c31-be2a-265e02ce8890","content_url":"https:\/\/ca.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/president-trump-halts-broadcom-takeover-qualcomm-000958961--finance.html","content_published_at":1520906165,"content_time":1520906165,"content_relative_time":66,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-7863ee4b-5f3b-3c02-96b1-727aecd883ac_a-1c7c4ab1-f16f-3a70-a0f0-426fa8add919","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-7863ee4b-5f3b-3c02-96b1-727aecd883ac_a-1c7c4ab1-f16f-3a70-a0f0-426fa8add919","author":"nanook","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/eleven-nations-not-u-sign-trans-pacific-trade-145402448.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kJr9yVRKfvUKhhtOOnCcRw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-03-08T200454Z_1_LYNXNPEE271WG_RTROPTP_2_TRADE-TPP-CHILE-SIGNING.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Y61bcN2f5ohiP7e7Lamvcw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-03-08T200454Z_1_LYNXNPEE271WG_RTROPTP_2_TRADE-TPP-CHILE-SIGNING.JPG","height":300,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-03-08T200454Z_1_LYNXNPEE271WG_RTROPTP_2_TRADE-TPP-CHILE-SIGNING.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":300,"title":"Asia-Pacific nations sign sweeping trade deal without U.S.","summary":"By Dave Sherwood and Felipe Iturrieta SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Eleven countries including Japan and Canada signed a landmark Asia-Pacific trade agreement without the United States on Thursday in what one minister called a powerful signal against protectionism and trade wars.

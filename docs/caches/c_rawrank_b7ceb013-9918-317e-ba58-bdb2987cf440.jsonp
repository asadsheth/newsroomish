It hasn't exactly caught on the way Black Friday has, but that's not stopping eBay from trying. SEE ALSO: Gifts under $20 that are actually useful Though the public hasn't really been anticipating the events of Green Monday (because no one knew about it) some of your favorite retailers are all over it: Target's and Macy's main pages have been taken over with Green Monday deals, while Ebay has a literal countdown clock with new deals coming every hour.\u00a0 This year, Green Monday falls exactly two weeks until Christmas.

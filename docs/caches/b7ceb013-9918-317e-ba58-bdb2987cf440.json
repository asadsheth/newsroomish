Sophos said that billings - an indicator of future revenues - had grown by 23pc in the three months to the end of March, the final quarter of its fiscal year. It was seen as a reassuring announcement, just three months after the company had revealed a sharp slowdown in growth. During the previous quarter, billings growth had declined sharply from 29pc to 18.7pc, spooking investors.\u00a0 Analysts said the release of new products\u00a0was likely to have boosted revenues. They\u00a0include one used to guard against malicious software that can hijack\u00a0computers to mine cryptocurrency, a trend that has intensified in recent months. Sophos, which sells antivirus and other cyber defence tools to businesses, has\u00a0been one of UK's stand-out technology stocks of the last year,\u00a0boosted by growing corporate fears about cyber attacks launched by criminals and rogue states. sophos shares six months The \"WannaCry\" global ransomware outbreak that crippled parts of the NHS as well as hundreds of businesses last year was seen as a particularly-crucial driver of growth last year. However,\u00a0the company's shares have fallen by more than a third since their peak in January\u00a0as growth appeared to slow\u00a0down. Private equity group Apax, its biggest shareholder, sold almost half its stake in November.\u00a0 Apax took Sophos public in 2015 in what was the biggest flotation of a software company in the UK, and a rare example of a technology group choosing London, rather than Wall Street, as a destination. Its value has doubled since then, despite the recent share price declines. On Thursday Sophos said that improved trading meant it was likely to report full-year billings at the top end of previous forecasts when it delivers full-year results next month. The news sent shares up as much as 20pc, before falling back slightly to trade 15.2pc up.

But it will have to wait a little longer for its first Australian win thanks to a virtuoso performance from Tom Curran, who bettered Tye with five for 35 and snuck England to a 12-run win in the fifth and final ODI. His two Tests might have come a bit too soon in his career, but Curran's stock as one of the most exciting limited-overs quicks in English cricket was clear for all to see. The 22-year-old held his nerve, nailed his yorkers and ensured England took an ODI series they dominated as convincingly as the 4-1 scoreline suggests.","published_at":1517155638,"content_id":"29e0b0d3-6c59-3a47-872c-c8ed807fc485","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sport\/2018\/jan\/28\/australia-england-fifth-one-day-international-tom-curran-stars?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_b-gdnnews","content_published_at":1517140280,"content_time":1517140280,"content_relative_time":108,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":108,"comment_relative_time":108,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"854e42ba-e26c-3cb6-98ca-bc27845d474f","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-88874557-3398-3cba-ae06-7641865692b4_a-854e42ba-e26c-3cb6-98ca-bc27845d474f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-88874557-3398-3cba-ae06-7641865692b4_a-854e42ba-e26c-3cb6-98ca-bc27845d474f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/unadkat-becomes-day-twos-first-5p6eha8","author":"nanook","provider":"ESPNcricinfo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/22238693","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J5fL1M4_uI2Ytyt2pX9IEQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1oWzZVvlLNTfdB1j1cWe6A--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_854e42ba-e26c-3cb6-98ca-bc27845d474f--373021916.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GFeFgLBzFkMapqjBVe5hfA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NTA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1oWzZVvlLNTfdB1j1cWe6A--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_854e42ba-e26c-3cb6-98ca-bc27845d474f--373021916.jpeg","height":450,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/1oWzZVvlLNTfdB1j1cWe6A--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_854e42ba-e26c-3cb6-98ca-bc27845d474f--373021916.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":450,"title":"Unadkat becomes day two's first millionaire","summary":"ESPNcricinfo staff Seamer Jaydev Unadkat became the first millionaire on day two of the IPL auction in Bengaluru, as well as the most expensive Indian buy over the two days.

After England's recent 4-0 Ashes series loss in Australia, many pundits accused the governing England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) of marginalising four-day County Championship matches, which are supposed to prepare players for Tests, by scheduling fixtures at the start and end of the summer rather than at the height of a season where Twenty20 fixtures now predominate.

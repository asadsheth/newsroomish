Every single Test match since the very first, between Australia and England at the MCG in March 1877, has begun with a toss of the coin to decide who should bat or bowl first. The home captain flips the coin and the visiting captain calls heads or tails. The proposed remedy is to abandon the coin toss for matches played as part of the Test Championship, to commence with Australia's Ashes tour of England in 2019, leaving the visiting side to elect whether to bat or bowl first.","published_at":1526534592,"content_id":"92b45608-d76b-307c-bf04-b75d4e6cd2fb","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23525914\/to-toss-not-toss?-icc-scrap-tradition","content_published_at":1526537032,"content_time":1526537032,"content_relative_time":34,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":34,"comment_relative_time":34,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5dce72ce-4e93-3850-be0a-d82aea51a53f","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-67ab42ef-509a-3c6f-bf4c-424af1c21ac5_a-5dce72ce-4e93-3850-be0a-d82aea51a53f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-67ab42ef-509a-3c6f-bf4c-424af1c21ac5_a-5dce72ce-4e93-3850-be0a-d82aea51a53f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/mark-waugh-slams-selfish-india-over-day-night-011922720--spt-341ya1v","author":"nanook","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/mark-waugh-slams-selfish-india-over-day-night-011922720--spt.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_rhvo3Vg4AqYyuafWCwWAA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/31856d13207713a1e42818958f9f201a7b7612dd.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V72at121oEd4nkLfO7FlqQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjI7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/31856d13207713a1e42818958f9f201a7b7612dd.jpg","height":722,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/31856d13207713a1e42818958f9f201a7b7612dd.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":722,"title":"Mark Waugh slams 'selfish' India over day-night Test snub","summary":"Retiring selector Mark Waugh has lashed out at \"selfish\" India for refusing to play a day-night Test during their tour of Australia, accusing the cricketing power of holding back the game.

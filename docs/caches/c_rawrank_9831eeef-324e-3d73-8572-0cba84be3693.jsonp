As the governing body's recently appointed anti-corruption general manager Alex Marshall sets out to investigate a wide assortment of claims made in The Sun newspaper and passed on to the ICC, the ACU is seeking to pivot from the symptoms of corruption - namely spot fixes by players - to its causes, and to see players as partners in the task of addressing it.

three-match series at 1-1. Riding Sharma's 208 not out, India scored 392-4 and later restricted Sri Lanka to 251-8. Angelo Mathews' knock of 111 not out went in vain. Chasing an improbable 393, Sri Lanka made a poor start and lost openers Danushka Gunathilaka (16) and Upul Tharanga (7) early. The visitors were reduced to 62-3 when Washington Sundar (1-65) bowled Upul Tharanga (7) in the 16th over. Mathews found support in Niroshan Dickwella (22) and put on 53 runs with him for the fourth wicket.

And he faces Cilic, who beat Kyle Edmund on Thursday, for their 10th ATP tour meeting. Federer has an 8-1 record over him beating him at the ATP Tour Finals in London and the Wimbledon final last year. But when is the match? Federer takes on Cilic looking to win his 20th Grand Slam title on Sunday morning. The match will start around 8.30am UK time. As ever with tennis scheduling, matches are set for 'not before' a certain time, so things may change in the build up. Today's match was played under the roof with the rain coming down in Melbourne as Federer eased towards victory.

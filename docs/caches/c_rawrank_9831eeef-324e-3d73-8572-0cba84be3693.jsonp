on Saturday, following the injury which has ruled Dale Steyn out of the rest of the series. Olivier, 25, has played in five Test matches with moderate success, while Ngidi, 21, is regarded as one of South Africa's most promising young bowlers. The two players will vie with several other members of the squad for a place in the starting line-up as South Africa seek to build on their 72-run win in the first Test at Newlands on Monday.","published_at":1515512422,"content_id":"455c9ce6-98b3-3470-a096-95aaa3459bc5","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/seamers-olivier-ngidi-added-south-africa-squad-184412956--spt.html","content_published_at":1515437052,"content_time":1515437052,"content_relative_time":53,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":53,"comment_relative_time":53,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"2f9289ff-7274-3807-9dd5-53af1fea0fe5","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-549f5a88-6591-301c-a05b-790ca2e1a3f3_a-2f9289ff-7274-3807-9dd5-53af1fea0fe5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-549f5a88-6591-301c-a05b-790ca2e1a3f3_a-2f9289ff-7274-3807-9dd5-53af1fea0fe5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/gibson-wants-four-quicks-throughout-567cnnv","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"ESPNcricinfo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/22012776\/ottis-gibson-wants-four-quicks-home-summer","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NuInZXTDM7l.3g0dbWxG4g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cm5xrQg2fBPcQH3kvsVp7g--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2f9289ff-7274-3807-9dd5-53af1fea0fe5-1807419367.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0PT1iGcgUR_wpKyJdQ_Yrg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Mjk7dz0xMjk2Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cm5xrQg2fBPcQH3kvsVp7g--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2f9289ff-7274-3807-9dd5-53af1fea0fe5-1807419367.jpeg","height":729,"width":1296,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cm5xrQg2fBPcQH3kvsVp7g--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2f9289ff-7274-3807-9dd5-53af1fea0fe5-1807419367.jpeg","imgw":1296,"imgh":729,"title":"Gibson wants four quicks throughout home summer","summary":"South Africa will field four frontline quicks as often as possible, particularly at home, as they aim for a more aggressive approach in familiar conditions. After the team's 72-run win in the opening Test against India, which was effectively achieved inside three days with a four-pronged pack pack, coach Ottis Gibson indicated the team balance will not change and South Africa will keep firing with their fast men. \"I'm a very fast-bowling minded coach and I guess we will always have to find a balance to see if we can get four fast bowlers in the team, first of all. We'll look at things like are the conditions suited to four fast bowlers.

Jinping says China willing to fight 'bloody battle' to regain rightful place in the world, in blistering nationalist speech","summary":"President Xi\u00a0Jinping\u00a0delivered a blistering nationalist speech Tuesday, warning against any attempts to split China and touting the country's readiness to fight \"the bloody battle\" to regain its rightful place in the world. Mr Xi, who is set to rule China for life having scrapped presidential term limits, lauded his vision of the \u201crejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d.\u00a0 He sent strong warnings to Taiwan and Hong Kong, self-governed regions that the Communist Party of China (CPC) seeks to unify politically with the mainland, saying that any efforts made towards their independence would be \u201cdoomed\u201d. In front of around 3,000 CPC delegates in the Great Hall next to Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, Mr Xi declared: \"The Chinese people have been indomitable and persistent, we have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle against our enemies to the bitter end.\u201d He said that China, which has been building military facilities in disputed territory in the South China Sea and has established military bases on recognised foreign soil since Mr Xi came to power in 2012, would not seek expansion. \"Only those who are accustomed to threatening others will see everyone as a threat,\" he said. Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech during the closing session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People on March 20 Credit: Lintao Zhang\/Getty Images As state media TV cameras honed in on delegates from Taiwan the President added: \u201cAll acts and tricks to separate the country are doomed to fail and will be condemned by the people and punished by history.\u201d\u00a0 Achieving \u201ctotal unity\u201d, he said, was the \u201ccollective hope of all Chinese people.\u201d The US does not recognise Taiwan as a separate country, in line with Beijing\u2019s wishes. However, last week US President Donald Trump riled the Chinese government by signing an agreement with Taiwan allowing US ships to move into Taiwanese waters. China is overseeing a massive global trade infrastructure initiative to revive the ancient Silk Road, drawing interest from nations participating in the investment but also criticism from others fearing that it mainly serves Beijing's interests. China propaganda puff The Chinese leader's plan to build a \"world-class\" military by mid-century has also raised concerns about how it plans to use its increasingly modern forces amid regional frictions over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. The highly-choreographed NPC, which takes place annually, saw the rubber stamping of Mr Xi\u2019s second presidential term as well as the abolition of his two-term limit.\u00a0 Many Chinese online commentators suggested that by pushing through the latter motion he was turning himself into an emperor-like figure, while others compared him to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Critical comments were, however, largely deleted by the government\u2019s army of censors. A major restructuring of the Chinese government was also announced during the NPC, which began on March 5. The move will see banking and insurance bodies merged and the formation of new ministries, such as those for immigration and the environment. High-ranking government personnel changes were confirmed too. Wang Qishan, formerly in charge of the government\u2019s corruption investigations department, was elevated to the position of Mr Xi\u2019s vice president.\u00a0 Yi Gang was named governor of China\u2019s central bank: a promotion from his position of vice governor.","published_at":1521535608,"content_id":"926a218b-ebaa-3731-b9a4-c5679bd83d7f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/xi-jinping-says-china-willing-084648143.html","content_published_at":1521535608,"content_time":1521535608,"content_relative_time":10,"reaction_count":1256,"vibe_name":"Trending","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":10,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff","post_id":"v-611e8982-b21b-33a7-a66a-e03bcf4392f7_c-109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff_a-109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-611e8982-b21b-33a7-a66a-e03bcf4392f7_c-109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff_a-109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/crime-justice\/v-611e8982-b21b-33a7-a66a-e03bcf4392f7_c-109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff_a-109e7318-87cc-36a1-9ad2-2ed6226a3eff","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/her-kidnapping-initially-called-hoax-woman-called-gone-113304443--abc-news-topstories.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4ZbtHsh8da_ODTBq6hokMg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.abcnewsplus.com\/9a54a30342e54ae48ea0c2ae1f0e67a2","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yPphSPjYKWib.80b1QV8Jg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.abcnewsplus.com\/9a54a30342e54ae48ea0c2ae1f0e67a2","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.abcnewsplus.com\/9a54a30342e54ae48ea0c2ae1f0e67a2","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"After her kidnapping was initially called a hoax, woman in so-called 'Gone Girl' case recounts her 'nightmare'","summary":"Later in 2015, a failed kidnapping attempt with many parallels to Huskins' rocked another California community and led to the arrest of Huskins's captor: Matthew Muller, a 38-year-old former attorney.

hottest new signee -- would be appearing on every edition of Raw until WrestleMania 34. It appeared that Rousey, who was advertised for Monday night's latest Raw, was missing the show again when a well-executed video package featuring her aired in the final half hour of the show. As far as fans at home were concerned, Rousey once again missed Raw.

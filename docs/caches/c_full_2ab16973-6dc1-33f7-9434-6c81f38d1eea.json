Created by Bryan Elsley and his son, Jamie Brittain, it was a show about young people written (mostly) by young people \u2013 a truthful, if comically exaggerated, exploration of what it meant to be 18, anxious and horny. Kiss Me First, Elsley\u2019s new Channel 4 drama, feels in certain ways like a spiritual successor \u2013 a Skins for the social media age \u2013 but an altogether more melancholy and less endearing one. In Skins the teenagers tended to crack gradually, here they were broken from the beginning. Loosely adapted from the young adult novel by Lottie Moggach, Kiss Me First follows both the real and virtual life of Leila (Tallulah Haddon), a reclusive 17 year-old who\u2019s been left adrift, grieving and penniless, in the wake of her mother\u2019s death. As an escape, she has become a dedicated fan of Azana, a virtual reality world in which gamers can wage war, fight in hand-to-hand combat, soar through the skies, or simply talk. All of which was animated in impressive, if slightly cartoonish CGI, blended with live-action. In one scene, we saw a dazzlingly bright and exciting battle in Azana intercut with the reality of Leila sitting alone in a VR headset, gesturing ridiculously in her drab bedroom. As many gamers already know, it is impossible to look cool in a VR headset. The obvious comparison is Steven Spielberg\u2019s recently released virtual reality movie Ready Player One. But its menu of pop-culture references offers nothing as nourishing as Kiss Me First\u2019s atmosphere of angst and despair \u2013 sold through the warm, golden hour feel of its colour grading, and a performance from newcomer Haddon that was as haunted as it was haunting, as though grief has made her skin uncomfortable to wear. This discomfort worked especially well when it met the broad comedy of Leila\u2019s new flatmate, the aspiring-but-awful actor Jonty (Matthew Aubrey), or the free-spirit hedonism of her new best friend Tess (Simona Brown), who Leila met after she discovered the Red Pill, a secret group of \u201closers\u201d hidden away in Azana. In Kiss Me First, Red Pill refers to the original meaning of the phrase, as a reference to the idea of truth over ignorance from the 1999 sci-fi film The Matrix, but the term has also seen itself co-opted in recent years by a sinister men\u2019s rights group on Reddit. Bizarrely, the latter seems more relevant. Secluded in a digital paradise, Azana\u2019s Red Pill is a hodgepodge of damaged youth, who were introduced inelegantly to Leila through dialogue like \u201cwe\u2019re f\u2013-ed up\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re unusual\u201d \u2013 lines that probably could have been nailed easily through live-action, but came across clunky in animation. Tallulah Haddon as Leila Credit: Channel 4 Their leader was the creepy, all-powerful Adrian (Matthew Beard), who lured in the vulnerable with a promise of belonging, with outlawed technology (called \u201csense bands\u201d) that allows members to touch and feel the virtual world, and then grooming them to kill themselves. Adrian\u2019s motives, much like a lot of things in this opener, were enigmatic and vague, giving us a lot of mystery but leaving little to grasp on to. This is perhaps a symptom of that before-mentioned melancholy, which imbues the show with a pace that burns thick and slow, suggesting the series\u2019 potential rather than stating it outright. As such, it\u2019s too early to tell how astute its observations about online relationships will be, how well it handles the friendship (and perhaps romance) between Leila and Tess, or whether the animation of Azana will end up being the show\u2019s blessing or its curse. But not to worry \u2013 such set-up problems are common of first episodes. Well, not Skins \u2013 its first episode was a masterclass in establishing its concept, grabbing your attention, earning your repeat investment. But Kiss Me First is not Skins.

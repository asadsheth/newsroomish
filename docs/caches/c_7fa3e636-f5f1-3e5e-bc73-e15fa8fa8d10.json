Engineers closed a section of State Road 434, just south of Black Hammock at Laurel Oaks Court, FDOT spokesman Steve Olson said. FDOT is still trying to figure out how to fix the pipe and repair the hole, so the road will remain closed until then. This section of roadway accommodates an average of 19,000 vehicles per day, according to the transportation department. A detour was set up by FDOT so drivers can use Tuskawilla Road and Red Bug Lake\/Mitchell Hammock Roads as alternate routes.","published_at":1528063583,"content_id":"25748bb5-1975-3be2-94f2-71351c1549f2","content_url":"http:\/\/www.orlandosentinel.com\/news\/os-traffic-oviedo-road-closed-hole-20180603-story.html","content_published_at":1528062600,"content_time":1528062600,"content_relative_time":20,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":20,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0e9b21c1-a751-33b1-82f9-8a30bff5417e","post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-a068fd2f-d243-3efa-97a4-0313f50969bf_a-0e9b21c1-a751-33b1-82f9-8a30bff5417e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-a068fd2f-d243-3efa-97a4-0313f50969bf_a-0e9b21c1-a751-33b1-82f9-8a30bff5417e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/fords-two-wheel-concept-car-217mps4","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Bloomberg","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/?cmpid=yhoo.logo","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/08\/bloomberg-106x27_102102.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2018-06-03\/ford-s-two-wheel-concept-car-gets-a-chinese-electric-makeover?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D0K3agt2prN6Xhgx2Ge6rQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/1c5cb934cb63f5b2baa8281c8ce542af","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0cfAz2Cmox7vpkvnt05Z_w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NzI7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/1c5cb934cb63f5b2baa8281c8ce542af","height":672,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/1c5cb934cb63f5b2baa8281c8ce542af","imgw":1200,"imgh":672,"title":"Ford's Two-Wheel Concept Car Gets a Chinese Electric Makeover","summary":"The two-wheeled vehicle whizzing around a Beijing test track is a mashup of motorcycle, electric car and space capsule, wrapped around the brain of a smartphone.

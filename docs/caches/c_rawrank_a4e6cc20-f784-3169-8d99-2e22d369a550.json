contractor while serving in Afghanistan, prosecutors said. David A. Turcios, 41, of San Jose, was charged in a July 2017 indictment with two counts of seeking and receiving $8,500 in bribes from two Afghan contractors who sought deals with the government for their companies, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He pleaded guilty to the second count of the indictment before U.S. District Court Judge John A. Mendez of the Eastern District of California in Sacramento. Turcios is the eighth defendant to plead guilty in this case, the DOJ said.

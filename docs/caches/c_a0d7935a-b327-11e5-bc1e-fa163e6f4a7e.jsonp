That odd result is reflected in a report issued Tuesday by the Trump administration. After federal aid, the average monthly premium paid by subsidized customers on HealthCare.gov is dropping to $89 from last year's $106. That's a 16 percent savings even though the \"list price\" premium went up about 30 percent, now averaging $639 for those subsidized customers. The bottom line is counterintuitive, but it shows how \"Obamacare\" subsidies cushion consumers from rising premiums.

set reveal a new look at Lashana Lynch in character as, well, we're not sure yet as details of who she's playing have been kept under wraps so far. As you can see from the images below, though, it looks like she may be a friend of Brie Larson's Carol Danvers, given that she's wearing an outfit that's similar to the one that Larson's rocking. If you'll recall, Lynch was a late-in-the-day replacement for DeWanda Wise, who had to drop out of\u00a0Captain Marvel\u00a0due to scheduling conflicts with her TV show\u00a0She's Gotta Have It. Rumours previously stated that Wise was playing Monica Rambeau, who's one of the other\u00a0heroes who's gone by the name Captain Marvel in the comics.","published_at":1523297898,"content_id":"32a6872f-0b52-371b-95f3-acc63c86a581","content_url":"http:\/\/wegotthiscovered.com\/movies\/captain-marvel-set-photos-lasana-lynch\/","content_published_at":1523279212,"content_time":1523279212,"content_relative_time":29,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Movies","vibe_id":"46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":29,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d42cde1e-2edd-375e-b8b4-98607a03aef9","post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-7fc9f681-ac7d-3e11-966d-cec8d9f70491_a-d42cde1e-2edd-375e-b8b4-98607a03aef9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-46906397-b90f-3125-a26e-b000769d9eb5_c-7fc9f681-ac7d-3e11-966d-cec8d9f70491_a-d42cde1e-2edd-375e-b8b4-98607a03aef9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/movies\/star-wars-15-weird-facts-26w81hv","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Screen Rant","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/star-wars-facts-darth-vader-helmet\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Star Wars: 15 Weird Facts About Darth Vader's Helmet","summary":"Darth Vader is easily one of the most well-known villains in history.

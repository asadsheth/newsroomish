Korea buying time to develop nuclear weapons, says Trump's new security adviser John Bolton","summary":"Incoming US national security adviser John Bolton on Sunday vowed to maintain a hardline stance in upcoming negotiations with North Korea, warning that Pyongyang was only coming to the table in an effort to buy time to develop its nuclear weapons programme. In his first interview since his nomination, Mr Bolton told the Cats Roundtable radio show that preparations were already underway for a historic US-North Korea summit, which should take place sooner rather than later to prevent Pyongyang from finalising missiles capable of striking the US. \u201cI think we have to look at what North Korea\u2019s motivation is here,\u201d he cautioned.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019ve got a very limited number of things that they need to do in North Korea to make their nuclear warheads actually deliverable on targets in the United States so they want to try to slow roll the negotiations to buy more time,\u201d Mr Bolton said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s certainly true that the normal route is months and months and months of preparation, that would simply play into the North Korean playbook, what they\u2019ve done many times before,\u201d he continued. The talks should be a \u201cstraightforward\u201d discussion, Mr Bolton added. North Korean Hyon Song Wol, left, head of a North Korean art troupe, exchanges documents with her South Korean counterpart Yun Sang after a meeting at the North side of Panmunjom last week \u201cIs North Korea going to give up its nuclear weapons, how are we going to do it, how are we going to take it out of the country? Not a theoretical discussion about these issues, but very concretely how they are going denuclearise North Korea. The sooner we get to it and cut to the chase, the better.\u201d The announcement of Mr Bolton\u2019s nomination as national security adviser on Friday gave rise to much debate over the weekend about the possible impact of his new role on a future, and unprecedented, summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump surprised the world, and much of his own administration, earlier this month when he accepted an invitation to meet Mr Kim and said it would take place \u201cby May\u201d. Pyongyang, however, has yet to formally confirm its participation. As national security adviser, Mr Bolton will hold huge sway over the White House\u2019s preparation for the talks and the tone of the meeting itself. \u00a0 In an interview with Radio Free Asia early last week, Mr Bolton, widely considered to be hawkish on foreign policy, said that discussions at the proposed summit should be similar to those that led to components of Libya\u2019s nuclear programme being shipped to the US in 2004. North Korean missile ranges \u201cLet\u2019s have this conversation by May, or even before that, and let\u2019s see how serious North Korea really is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not prepared to have that kind of serious discussion, it could actually be a very short meeting.\u201d But Mr Bolton\u2019s long-time tough approach to foreign policy could lead to a breakdown in the recent diplomatic d\u00e9tente with Pyongyang that was forged during the Winter Olympics, fear some North Korea analysts. In the early 2000s, after a trading of insults between Mr Bolton and Pyongyang, the North Koreans refused to negotiate if he was at the table, pointed out Ankit Panda, senior editor at The Diplomat magazine. \u00a0 In the recent past, Mr Bolton has publicly supported the idea of regime change, and laid out the legal case for striking North Korea first. \u201cBolton... is a vehement proponent of preventative war. His appointment does not bode well for a successful first US-North Korea summit,\u201d Mr Panda told the Telegraph. Others have warned that the failure of the high-stake talks would increase the chances of military action. \u201cPeople are genuinely nervous,\u201d said Robert Kelly, professor of political science at South Korea\u2019s Busan University, adding that the North Koreans may be more hesitant to join talks with Mr Bolton in the room. \u201cThe North Koreans still haven\u2019t technically accepted the summit\u2026 I wonder if this is going to deter them from accepting it all.\u201d","published_at":1522212809,"content_id":"cd2f91c8-6ea1-356c-9d71-5711fb8257ab","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-buying-time-develop-081313370.html","content_published_at":1522051993,"content_time":1522051993,"content_relative_time":82,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ac7a7c33-d609-33c4-bc21-1363a0b9e665_a-52523aff-c9d1-3fb8-bb9e-57dd9cbfc9e6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ac7a7c33-d609-33c4-bc21-1363a0b9e665_a-52523aff-c9d1-3fb8-bb9e-57dd9cbfc9e6","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Time","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/apos-kim-jong-un-visit-064354414.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/THK3XNoNzyLgMmfAk._aCg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.timevideos.com\/ef83de57c27585bdb30b4129949b322f","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/xbx528AQwZWhNBGyhbnIhg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.timevideos.com\/ef83de57c27585bdb30b4129949b322f","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.timevideos.com\/ef83de57c27585bdb30b4129949b322f","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Here's What a Kim Jong Un Visit to Beijing Could Mean for the U.S.","summary":"China wants a seat at the table; Kim is expert at exploiting divisions.","published_at":1522227086,"content_id":"52523aff-c9d1-3fb8-bb9e-57dd9cbfc9e6","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/apos-kim-jong-un-visit-064354414.html","content_published_at":1522133034,"content_time":1522133034,"content_relative_time":59,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

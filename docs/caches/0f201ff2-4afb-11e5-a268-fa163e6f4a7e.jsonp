The highly unusual, secret visit comes as the enemy nations prepare for a meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim, in what would the first ever summit between U.S. and North Korean during more than six decades of hostility since the Korean War. The Washington Post, which first reported Pompeo's meeting with Kim, said it took place over Easter weekend \u2014 just over two weeks ago, shortly after the CIA chief was nominated to become secretary of state. Trump, who is currently at his Florida resort meeting with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, said Tuesday that the U.S. and North Korea were holding direct talks at \u201cextremely high levels\u201d in preparation for a possible summit with Kim.","published_at":1524017444,"content_id":"6ebdb3e4-35fe-34b2-bc41-ef0e8a5e7fd0","content_url":"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/?p=10797420","content_published_at":1524004986,"content_time":1524004986,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3f1df74-78df-3143-94e0-db49ccccc38d_a-4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f3f1df74-78df-3143-94e0-db49ccccc38d_a-4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Fox News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2018\/04\/17\/us-japan-summit-underway-with-trump-and-abe-showcases-special-relationship.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/k_Q0L3QXW_p2mmgaAy3lyQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GNo5x3QTWNyMRc1LfcZYxA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0--1047898168.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/12ljHE0NUvqHdHVEI9R2sA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GNo5x3QTWNyMRc1LfcZYxA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0--1047898168.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GNo5x3QTWNyMRc1LfcZYxA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0--1047898168.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"US-Japan summit underway with Trump and Abe showcases 'special relationship'","summary":"The U.S.-British alliance \u2013 a bond forged in blood in two world wars, is the so-called \u201cspecial relationship\u201d most people fawn over.

Just looking over the amount of issues these two world leaders will need to discuss, their \u201cspecial relationship\u201d will be tested in a historic manner. At the start of their meeting, President Trump announced, with Abe at his side, that North and South Korean leaders \u2013 who are holding their own summit April 27 \u2013 will seek to finally reach an agreement to formally end the Korean War, which was halted with an armistice in 1953.","published_at":1524001895,"content_id":"4e627d21-7aa2-3296-8f82-462aafafc1c0","content_url":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2018\/04\/17\/us-japan-summit-underway-with-trump-and-abe-showcases-special-relationship.html","content_published_at":1524000600,"content_time":1524000600,"content_relative_time":24,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-29eebf17-1160-3f25-b72d-c7b416d85a60_a-2a61aac0-2779-3b96-9d4c-56e8fe38ea24","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/trump-turns-state-visit-infomercial-3pa45dl","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"thinkprogress.org","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/trump-shinzo-abe-infomercial-mar-a-lago-d848a1ec7e43\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Trump turns state visit into infomercial for his private club","summary":"On Tuesday afternoon, President Trump used a photo op with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to promote his private Mar-a-Lago club. Shortly after Abe arrived in Florida for his second visit to the property, Trump told reporters that \u201cmany of the world's great leaders request to come to Mar-a-Lago and Palm Beach. They like it. I like it. We're comfortable.\u201d Trump, who broke precedent by refusing to divest from his business interests when he assumed office, still profits from Mar-a-Lago. Since he was inaugurated, initiation fees have doubled to $200,000, and the Trump Organization has cranked up prices for entry to events. Mar-a-Lago membership comes with perks that go beyond access to the president.","published_at":1523997247,"content_id":"2a61aac0-2779-3b96-9d4c-56e8fe38ea24","content_url":"https:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/trump-shinzo-abe-infomercial-mar-a-lago-d848a1ec7e43\/","content_published_at":1523996640,"content_time":1523996640,"content_relative_time":25,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]);

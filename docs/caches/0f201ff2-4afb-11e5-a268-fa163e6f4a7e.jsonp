crucial for turnout.\u00a0 Republican strategists have told The Daily Telegraph they are feeling much more upbeat about their prospects for keeping control of the Senate come November. \u00a0 Some believe voters are taking little interest\u00a0in the Russian election meddling investigation and White House personnel controversies dominating coverage from Washington.\u00a0 Instead they think the president will get the credit for the growing economy - expanding at 2.3 per cent a year according to recent figures - and low unemployment rate.\u00a0 The optimism is a far cry from last autumn, when Mr Trump had failed to pass any major legislation after months of White House chaos and a falling approval rating.\u00a0 But in the last six months Mr Trump has forced through a $1.5 trillion tax cut, delivered on campaign promises like scraping the Iran deal and implementing steel tariffs, and made progress in North Korea.\u00a0 Republicans currently hold majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, the two lawmaking bodies that make up the US Congress.\u00a0 While they are still expected to lose control of the House to the Democrats at the November mid-terms, hopes are high for holding the Senate and keeping House losses to a minimum.\u00a0 A recent CNN poll asking voters which party they would back in congressional elections showed the Democrats leading the Republicans by just three percentage points.\u00a0 Some 47 per cent said Democrat and 44 per cent Republican - a major change from February, when 54 per cent said Democrat and 38 per cent said Republican.\u00a0 Other polls have the race tightening, while there are also signs of rising enthusiasm among Republicans to get out and vote - a crucial factor in the elections.\u00a0 Mr Trump's approval rating is also at its highest point since May 2017, though it remains lower than most past presidents at the same point in their first terms.\u00a0 Discussing the changes, one Republican strategist told this newspaper: \u201cTax cuts have helped us, jobs are good, the economy is doing good, the stock market is relatively strong.\u00a0 \u201cThe images of the hostages coming back from North Korea gives us a sense of international stability and security, whereas people might have had some trepidation six months ago.\u00a0 \u201cThe Washington bubble can get lost in the topics they feel like covering rather than the issues the average person feels.\u201d A senior Republican aide in Congress said: \u201cThe Democrats are spending a lot of time talking about things like Russia and the Mueller investigation [into Russian election meddling]. That is not what people talk about every day at a local level.\u00a0 \u201cWhat the Democrats really need but they don\u2019t have is some national issue and message.\u201d\u00a0 Mr Trump has already hit the mid-term campaign, holding a tub-thumping rally in Indiana last week where he said \u201cKeep America Great\u201d would be his new slogan.\u00a0 His speech gave the clearest hint yet of the topics he will frame the race around: Protecting jobs, growing the economy, tightening borders and tackling foes abroad as well as attacking the media and championing American patriotism.\u00a0 Mr Trump told a cheering crowd: \u201cEvery day between now and November [we have to] elect more Republicans so we can continue making America great again.\u201d\u00a0","published_at":1526221219,"content_id":"79da9777-78af-386b-908b-97f9ba53bd58","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-midterm-election-hopes-141551801.html","content_published_at":1526220951,"content_time":1526220951,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":2,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-22732249-164a-31ff-8de8-b80ff3083ceb_a-cebfeaf6-a7e1-3b11-9311-64832edbb41f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/eastern-stability-might-improving-relationships-4htkozx","author":"third_watch","provider":"FX Empire","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.fxempire.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-06-19\/94c63ea0-550f-11e7-8b5b-2b4c1390cc46_fxempire_112_27.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/eastern-stability-might-improving-relationships-083316897.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ihr7m15RCJoAv1xpjiyusA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fx_empire_176\/63ffada201b973a34fd144e97c17e7be","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/5uTC9J2nT_cCJasV6J22aQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjA7dz02MzA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fx_empire_176\/63ffada201b973a34fd144e97c17e7be","height":420,"width":630,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/fx_empire_176\/63ffada201b973a34fd144e97c17e7be","imgw":630,"imgh":420,"title":"Eastern Stability: How Might Improving Relationships with China, Israel, and Korea Affect the Forex Market?","summary":"Geopolitical events play a significant part in the way various currencies perform in the forex market.

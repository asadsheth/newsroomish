The response came after Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, singled out John Bolton, Mr Trump\u2019s new hardline national security adviser, for criticism.\u00a0 Mr Bolton said last month that the \u201cLibya model\u201d from 2003 and 2004, when Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up his nuclear weapons programme, would be used for North Korean talks.\u00a0 However Gaddafi ended up being beaten and killed in the streets by a mob in 2011 after his government was thrown from office.\u00a0 Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, said of Mr Bolton that \u201cwe do not hide our feelings of repugnance towards him\u201d in a statement issued by the North Korean Central News Agency.\u00a0 Mr Kim claimed the remarks cast doubt on America's sincerity, underlining that his country was not Libya, which met a \"miserable fate.\" He added: \"This is not an expression of intention to address the issue through dialogue. It is essentially a manifestation of awfully sinister moves to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq which had [sic] been collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers.\" North Korea analysts have cautioned that the undignified, brutal death of Gaddafi may be foremost on Kim Jong-un's mind ahead of talks on denuclearisation. Several also pointed to Mr Bolton's fractious history with North Korea when he was appointed by Mr Trump in March. In 2003, North Korea refused to participate in multilateral talks if Mr Bolton was present after he labelled then leader Kim Jong-il a \u201ctyrannical dictator\u201d, a memory which the regime invoked on Wednesday. His remarks followed an unexpected announcement by KCNA on Tuesday that planned talks with South Korea had been postponed just hours before they were due to start because of the joint military drills.\u00a0 America was also warned that \u201ccareful deliberations\u201d would need to take place over whether to go ahead with Mr Trump\u2019s planned meeting with Kim. Asked if his meeting with Kim will go ahead, Mr Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see, we\u2019ll have to see. \u00a0No decision. We haven't been notified at all. We'll have to see.\u201d North Korea has voiced frustration at US demands that the regime \u201cunilaterally\u201d gives up its nuclear programme.\u00a0 Senior Trump administration figures have previously said sanctions would only be lifted after Kim gives up his nuclear arsenal.\u00a0 Mr Trump reportedly said \u201cyes\u201d on Wednesday when asked if he will still insist on the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0 Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said of North Korea\u2019s threat to pull the meeting: \"This is something that we fully expected. The president is very use and ready for tough negotiations.\u201d \u201cIf they want to meet we\u2019ll be ready and if they don\u2019t that\u2019s okay too.

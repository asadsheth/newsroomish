In this roguelike adventure, you enter the Compound and storm its many levels of randomized enemies, clearing out each floor before progressing to the next. There's just four weapons to pick up right now, and only two can be taken with you at a time, but McKechnie has wisely strayed away from the tiresome dual-wielding lunacy that's informed far too many VR shooters over the past few years in favor of reigning it back to one gun at a time.","published_at":1526726570,"content_id":"a82c5d9f-2596-3bbc-b9b6-600e1a03531b","content_url":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/05\/19\/compound-is-an-wolfenstein-3d-style-shooter-in-vr\/","content_published_at":1526726070,"content_time":1526726070,"content_relative_time":55,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-e6db4bfc-7fc7-3f73-9b55-5a1c50c30e74_a-e14f8af0-e6fa-31d4-93d7-7bda398f0282","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/subaeria-runs-1080p-ps4-pro-67ly04l","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"SegmentNext","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/05\/19\/subaeria-runs-at-1080p-on-ps4-pro-and-720p-on-xbox-one-x\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Subaeria Runs At 1080p On PS4 Pro And 720p On Xbox One X","summary":"Subaeria is an intense action puzzler with rogue like-elements where players use their wits to manipulate their enemies into destroying each other which is making its way from Windows to console platforms including Xbox One and PS4.

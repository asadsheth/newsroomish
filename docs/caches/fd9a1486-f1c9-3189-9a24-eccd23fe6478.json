It will come out July 24, the same date as The Banner Saga 3 will be releasing on consoles and PC platforms. The Banner Saga as a whole tells the story of a world in its last days as a creeping darkness works its way across the land, corrupting everything within it and sparking wars as it drives the race of stone golems known as the dredge into lands controlled by humans and the horned giants known as the varl. The Banner Saga 2 gave us a huge amount of information about the plot (which we can't go into because of spoilers) but if you haven't played the series before, you can get the Banner Saga Trilogy: Bonus Edition for Xbox One and Playstation 4 to run through all of the games and get the whole story.","published_at":1523570614,"content_id":"a207a0bd-22bb-38f5-8272-d542bf408cfb","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/04\/13\/stoic-studios-announces-the-banner-saga-trilogy-bonus-edition\/","content_published_at":1523569989,"content_time":1523569989,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-9a385601-9609-3432-b6ba-d7861c82c07f_a-16d75f24-09dd-3fbe-b6fb-fa34e0b8812d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/original-god-war-better-gave-31vr8mk","author":"third_watch","provider":"Digital Trends","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/original-god-war-better-gave-214712298.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.m0TN.Md01j6u3B5D2eF.A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/7a2681a035c09ca8348b39a6d1992049","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cUbS2Wgj7FzMdT.zZ1SYyA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04NDQ7dz0xNTAwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/7a2681a035c09ca8348b39a6d1992049","height":844,"width":1500,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/7a2681a035c09ca8348b39a6d1992049","imgw":1500,"imgh":844,"title":"The Original \u2018God of War\u2019 was better than I gave it credit for, but could have been so much more.","summary":"After 15 years, we found the Original \u2018God of War\u2019 deserved more credit than we gave it, but it also could have been so much more.","published_at":1523569773,"content_id":"16d75f24-09dd-3fbe-b6fb-fa34e0b8812d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/original-god-war-better-gave-214712298.html","content_published_at":1523569632,"content_time":1523569632,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-4e3c66f0-e7b0-3be4-8e5a-667480b6321b_a-ce78e06b-1919-3580-bca6-81246759ad9f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/gamefly-pre-owned-ps4-xbox-29wo30a","author":"nanook","provider":"GameSpot","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/gamefly-has-a-pre-owned-ps4-xbox-one-game-sale-in-\/1100-6458132\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hxWpScL1cL6ZmDFr.JGTkA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b2NfScrLKi.Fwr2FNc7bLA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ce78e06b-1919-3580-bca6-81246759ad9f--1378355298.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/z15iqSjy.Um2PDUmxit39A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b2NfScrLKi.Fwr2FNc7bLA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ce78e06b-1919-3580-bca6-81246759ad9f--1378355298.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/b2NfScrLKi.Fwr2FNc7bLA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ce78e06b-1919-3580-bca6-81246759ad9f--1378355298.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Gamefly Has A Pre-Owned PS4, Xbox One Game Sale In The US","summary":"As you might imagine, Gamefly ends up with a lot of used games.

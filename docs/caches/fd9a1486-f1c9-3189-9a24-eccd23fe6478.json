In addition to getting hands-on with the Nintendo Switch-exclusive Tournament Mode, we dived a bit further into the collection, and got to see just what makes this particular package so special.","published_at":1521138847,"content_id":"36f4cd99-5504-32e9-a5e5-f1b081ed8afb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/new-street-fighter-30th-anniversary-collection-rev\/1100-6457378\/","content_published_at":1521113040,"content_time":1521113040,"content_relative_time":31,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-cf48b091-22d7-3d96-a13f-dc0041f5697e_a-37818037-68a7-3aff-8437-54e9eb3d5eab","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/world-warcrafts-next-allied-race-3r5nijh","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Polygon","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2018\/3\/15\/17123334\/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-allied-race-kul-tiran-humans","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hL.rfauXqvBSPjzIlOL.1w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z3ucDw9yM6WyDuYgxC7C8A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_37818037-68a7-3aff-8437-54e9eb3d5eab--1642420430.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3Yi9jT6cSgimX0mSIyfsGw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z3ucDw9yM6WyDuYgxC7C8A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_37818037-68a7-3aff-8437-54e9eb3d5eab--1642420430.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Z3ucDw9yM6WyDuYgxC7C8A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_37818037-68a7-3aff-8437-54e9eb3d5eab--1642420430.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"World of Warcraft's next allied race could be Kul Tiran humans","summary":"At BlizzCon 2017, the World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth developers announced six new allied races \u2014 Nightborne Elves, Highmountain Tauren, Zandalari Trolls, Void Elves, Lightforged Draenei and Dark Iron Dwarves \u2014 are coming to WoW.

On Monday, Nintendo did finally roll out another major, numbered system update, but it isn't as exciting as we hoped it might be. The highlight of Nintendo Switch version 5.0.0 seems to be the ability to add friends from Facebook and Twitter using the console's Friend Suggestions feature. Once you have linked your social media account to your Nintendo Account, you will see suggestions based on the people you're connected with on those services. Other changes include the addition of 24 new ARMS- and Kirby-themed icons for your user picture, the option to filter news to view only unread news or news from certain channels, notifications for when pre-purchased software is ready to play, and Pro Controller grip colors will now show up in the Controllers menu. Plus, Switch games purchased on a PC or phone will begin to download sooner than before, even if the Switch is in Sleep Mode. There are also a bundle of parental control changes, such as a new default method for PIN entry, the ability to restrict captured videos in the Album, and the option to add games to a whitelist from the Parental Controls app. Typically, your Switch will automatically download the latest software update as soon as it rolls out, but if not, you can manually start the update by heading to System Settings > System and tapping on the System Update button.","published_at":1521060934,"content_id":"04d0fa47-cc8c-3fc4-b3fc-cf85080fbaca","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/everything-nintendo-switch-system-5-0-0-215658048.html","content_published_at":1520978218,"content_time":1520978218,"content_relative_time":69,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-1f2bf084-1660-3d3e-9c96-cf561d3ba3e9_a-76e584e6-323c-3779-9d23-cc665dd442fb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-1f2bf084-1660-3d3e-9c96-cf561d3ba3e9_a-76e584e6-323c-3779-9d23-cc665dd442fb","author":"nanook","provider":"GameSpot","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-confirmed-for-ps4-xbox-o\/1100-6457424\/?ftag=GSS-05-10aab8e","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZliMyE9etIw.MGbN1PD5lA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Rkki0BjidI85ZHueSIl70A--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76e584e6-323c-3779-9d23-cc665dd442fb--1092461701.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bqrA2c3fFyB_sEC2NK8SeQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Rkki0BjidI85ZHueSIl70A--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76e584e6-323c-3779-9d23-cc665dd442fb--1092461701.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Rkki0BjidI85ZHueSIl70A--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76e584e6-323c-3779-9d23-cc665dd442fb--1092461701.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Shadow Of The Tomb Raider Confirmed For PS4, Xbox One, PC; Release Date Revealed","summary":"After a number of rumors and leaks, Square Enix has finally confirmed that the next Lara Croft game will be Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

Digital Foundry took a look at the patched version of the game running on the Switch and wondered if it might be the worst port yet. Performance With the Switch docked, frame rates for matches with two wrestlers generally range between 25 and 30 fps. Three versus three tag-team matches drop frame rates to around 20 fps. The developers showed mercy by eliminating battle royales with eight wrestlers altogether. In comparison, the Xbox One runs three versus three matches at or very near 60 fps.

No wonder I'm so taken by Studio Calavera's gorgeous 2D take on the classic, which features beautiful pixel art, a hot new soundtrack, and challenging retro platformer gameplay. Developed by a tiny team of three, MiniDoom 2 is a remake of the unofficial 2D game that brothers Felipe and Juan Carlos Porcel made a couple of years ago as part of a game programming course they taught. This version fleshes out the idea with 17 new levels that include tons of collectibles and secrets, as well as 14 weapons inspired by the entire catalog of Doom titles.","published_at":1520845825,"content_id":"a2e45b9c-c8cb-35c9-bd27-67e2858325fe","content_url":"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/gaming\/2018\/03\/12\/minidoom-2-reimagines-the-classic-shooter-as-a-delightfully-dark-2d-platformer\/","content_published_at":1520845770,"content_time":1520845770,"content_relative_time":105,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-5806bd60-55c4-390f-8e4d-db87c19bfcff_a-7b98ed37-b4cc-3bf5-a3e9-f1dbf2c2bbe8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/state-decay-2-system-requirements-3d1ua6n","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"SegmentNext","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/12\/state-of-decay-2-system-requirements\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"State Of Decay 2 System Requirements Revealed And They Are Quite Reasonable","summary":"State of Decay 2 is one of the Xbox One exclusives that will launch this year and developer Undead Labs has revealed the State Of Decay 2 System Requirements detailing the minimum and recommended specs to play the game.

For that reason the developers Bluehole decided to roll back the update, in order to fix those issues. The latest PUBG Update that rolled out for PC is now back in the hands of developers until they can figure out the issues that are causing the players to experience crashing and errors messages in the game.

Week 7 challenges include two in particular that will require either some legwork on your part or a guide to specific locations--which is where we come in. The first of these trickier challenges asks you to follow the treasure map found in Retail Row, something that is labeled as a \"Hard\" objective (meaning you get 10 Battle Stars for completing it). This works identically to other treasure map challenges: You hunt down a map randomly located in the stated area, and it directs you to another location on the map, where you have to collect an item.

Fortnite fans recently spotted a comet floating in the skies above Tilted Towers.\u00a0 This has led to speculation that Epic Games is getting ready to level the region in a bid to balance the game. One popular theory is that the comet will strike Tilted Towers at the end of season 3 on April 30. This is based on a morse code message linked to newly discovered controller rumblings. According to one\u00a0Reddit\u00a0user, the rumblings translate to \"SOS D 5 418\", which supports the Tilted Towers theory. Tilted Towers is located at D5 on the map, while 418 could be a reference to April 2018. The SOS, meanwhile, is pretty self-explanatory.","published_at":1524042793,"content_id":"c6e17928-f868-377b-9151-6ce8cd165710","content_url":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/entertainment\/gaming\/947761\/Fortnite-Tilted-Towers-meteor-strike-Epic-Battle-Royale-changes-update","content_published_at":1524057900,"content_time":1524057900,"content_relative_time":7,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d609d635-3513-3d4d-b5f3-7a0cd13be64b_a-a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d609d635-3513-3d4d-b5f3-7a0cd13be64b_a-a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Telegraph","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-11-25\/6444b400-b2f3-11e6-8ae7-f78be97b10cf_app_icon_square_128px.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.style.yahoo.com\/spider-man-ps4-hands-preview-070200703.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AUerkWJKWIRMAAoKN49SIQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/211f40464e4f355931eb0cb7cdeaf4eb","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ail_sso.poPpfwltpgtkVw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xOTU5O3c9MzEzNDs-\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/211f40464e4f355931eb0cb7cdeaf4eb","height":1959,"width":3134,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/211f40464e4f355931eb0cb7cdeaf4eb","imgw":3134,"imgh":1959,"title":"Spider-Man PS4 hands-on preview | Sensational swinging has Insomniac aiming for amazing","summary":"Spider-Man PS4 hands-on preview | Sensational swinging has Insomniac aiming for amazing","published_at":1524034920,"content_id":"a71eb779-7c1e-37cf-9085-a2944933d72f","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.style.yahoo.com\/spider-man-ps4-hands-preview-070200703.html","content_published_at":1524062282,"content_time":1524062282,"content_relative_time":6,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b3709178-5d9a-39f5-994e-7a8fc01e3e28_a-981a99e1-a6b5-381a-ade1-fc11c6a579d0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/fortnite-meteor-strike-tilted-towers-2nlojc2","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Express.co.uk","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/entertainment\/gaming\/947679\/Fortnite-meteor-Tilted-Towers-PS4-Xbox-One","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/G.EmtSkBzjWDM99RL5PpaQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HYs3zinHeD2IfnrjLKaLWw--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_981a99e1-a6b5-381a-ade1-fc11c6a579d0--281046907.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Q_gNfWHfGIzPRezF9YLR_A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NDU7dz03NTA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HYs3zinHeD2IfnrjLKaLWw--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_981a99e1-a6b5-381a-ade1-fc11c6a579d0--281046907.jpeg","height":445,"width":750,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HYs3zinHeD2IfnrjLKaLWw--\/dz03NTA7aD00NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_981a99e1-a6b5-381a-ade1-fc11c6a579d0--281046907.jpeg","imgw":750,"imgh":445,"title":"Fortnite meteor strike on Tilted Towers coming soon to PS4 and Xbox One?","summary":"Unfortunately for those wanting a definite answer about Epic Games' plans for the meteor, there doesn't appear to be one out there right now.

Thanks to a Q&A with game director Ian Hazzikostas at Blizzard's headquarters, we now have a better idea of how the new world PvP system will work. If you're unfamiliar with the term, world PvP refers to players attacking and killing other players in the open world rather than designated arenas and battlegrounds. In the past, World of Warcraft's servers have either had world PvP turned on or world PvP turned off. In Battle for Azeroth, every server will have world PvP turned off by default \u2014 but this is where the new War Mode comes into","published_at":1524001248,"content_id":"cd30a70c-3395-39d1-9807-df87a8648f09","content_url":"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2018\/4\/17\/17218594\/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-war-mode-world-pvp","content_published_at":1523941200,"content_time":1523941200,"content_relative_time":39,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-901f8e4d-4233-3c00-a9ec-3a34e6884d8b_a-327b2654-b5d4-34dd-a4dc-89f720b6e7d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-booting-4zzrvcd","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"SegmentNext","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/04\/18\/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-booting-games-now-but-cant-really-run-them\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Nintendo Switch Emulator Yuzu Booting Games Now, But Can't Really Run Them","summary":"Puyo Puyo Tetris and Cave Story are some of the first games that the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu can boot up, and the number of games will likely increase as the emulator's developers to get better at Yuzu booting games. The current games are simple, but they'll likely get more complicated. As an emulator, there are certain things that software like Yuzu can and can't boot, hence the emulator having to start out by working with fairly graphically simple games that don't require much processing power to work with.

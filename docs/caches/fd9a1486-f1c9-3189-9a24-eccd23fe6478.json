Although the price is still low by world standards, the increase is substantial in a country where the average monthly wage is estimated to be about $350.

Nintendo says that the app is in development now and\u00a0will launch by March 2019, which marks the end of the company's next fiscal year. Unfortunately, that's all that the company was willing to share about the game. Providing that it launches before the Legend of Zelda\u00a0game that is presumably still in the works, Mario Kart Tour will be the fifth first-party mobile game from Nintendo since it invested in mobile, following Miitomo and Super Mario Run in 2016 as well as\u00a0Fire Emblem Heroes and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp last year. In addition to the Mario Kart announcement, Nintendo also confirmed that the Nintendo Switch Online service will launch in September 2018. Similar to Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, the service was initially set to launch last fall, but was then pushed back to 2018. Nintendo refrained from sharing any specifics in terms of a launch date (or even a window), but now we know that it won't be ready for prime time until the fall. Nintendo Switch Online will cost $19.99 for a year-long membership, $7.99 for three months or $3.99 for one month. Beyond online play, the online service will also include a Classic Game Selection feature which will allow subscribers to download a classic Nintendo title for free, such as\u00a0Super Mario Bros. 3\u00a0for the NES. Further details regarding Mario Kart Tour and the long-awaited Nintendo Switch Online subscription service are likely incoming, but for now, all we have is the information that Nintendo shared in tweets on Wednesday.","published_at":1517515645,"content_id":"ed069675-5a7d-33e9-92c8-a946ed7bd41c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/nintendo-announces-mario-kart-tour-smartphones-nintendo-switch-123514443.html","content_published_at":1517488514,"content_time":1517488514,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-00c40c03-a974-36d7-846a-ffbe9dd2af50_a-c28d2778-4a7e-309f-9bbe-745ff61b6a30","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/logan-paul-im-good-guy-2z1e174","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"EW.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/ew.com\/tv\/2018\/02\/01\/logan-paul-good-morning-america-interview-controversy\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N_txBTYrbWAnhnAuQ2204g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V2NIh5vfKgjDQNLnuheBjw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c28d2778-4a7e-309f-9bbe-745ff61b6a30--391912749.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wEHl6e3m3AAGJIDKagnZEg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V2NIh5vfKgjDQNLnuheBjw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c28d2778-4a7e-309f-9bbe-745ff61b6a30--391912749.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/V2NIh5vfKgjDQNLnuheBjw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c28d2778-4a7e-309f-9bbe-745ff61b6a30--391912749.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Logan Paul: 'I'm a good guy who made a bad decision,' in first interview after controversy","summary":"Logan Paul\u00a0sat down with ABC's\u00a0Good Morning America\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0for his first television interview since facing\u00a0severe backlash over a controversial video\u00a0that appeared to show the body of an alleged suicide victim in Japan.

Humanity has been overrun by the Ravenii, ogres that tower over buildings and impose their will on a human civilization. As the game's title suggests, the Ravenii must be defeated or else the human race will cease to exist.

Bungie is doing its best to make good, however, and its been upping both its promises for transparency and, in some instances, its actual transparency. Today we get Masterwork Armor and Raid armor with specific\u00a0Raid perks, both of which hope to add back in some of the variety that made armor interesting in the original Destiny and was entirely absent from Destiny 2 at launch.

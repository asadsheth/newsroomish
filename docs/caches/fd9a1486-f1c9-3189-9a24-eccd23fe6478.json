As Paul Tassi says, the Battle Pass is a smart compromise between the realities of free-to-play economics and the exploitative nature of loot boxes: it works like a sort of optional subscription system that people who play the game religiously are more than happy to participate in. The Battle Pass itself is no joke: two weeks in and I'm at Tier 24 having done a fair number of challenges and put in a good amount of time, even if all of that time was without a victory or a sniper kill (I hate snipers). The theoretical apex reward in the battle pass is a skin that transforms your character into John Wick, someone that looks exactly like John Wick, and it's a great piece of loot to quest after.","published_at":1520197874,"content_id":"ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidthier\/2018\/03\/04\/high-octane-glider-how-to-get-the-secret-tier-100-challenge-reward-in-fortnite-battle-royale\/","content_published_at":1520139600,"content_time":1520139600,"content_relative_time":65,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-57d879e9-f507-34c3-b95e-ac17f2587bdf_a-3997e4bc-820b-38e4-b267-98c9765d6764","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/spyro-dragon-twitter-page-being-3s7kdk1","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"SegmentNext","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/03\/396147\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"New Spyro The Dragon Twitter Page Is Being Created, Could Hint At Remastered Games","summary":"Two weeks ago a rumor started going around that the original Spyro the Dragon trilogy would be getting a remastering similar to those given to Jak and Daxter and the Crash Bandicoot games.

Activision has previously indicated that more remasters of older games are on their way, and with Spyro having not gotten a game in years (barring the character making his way into the Skylanders games), the time might be ripe for a new Spyro game, or at least some acknowledgement that the series still exists.

Judging from the reveal trailer (and the name), it will be a spin-off of the quirky pen-and-paper role-playing game. Gameplay will be similar to other strategy titles such as XCOM where you control multiple team members on a grid. The difference here is that only combat will be turn-based; exploring the maps and sneaking around will be done in real time. The three main characters are Selma, Bormin and Dux. Selma is a human with the power to transform into \u2014 something.

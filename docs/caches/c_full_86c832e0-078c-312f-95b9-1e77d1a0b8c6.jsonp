I think there's a difference that I would call the mother-daughter difference. And it's this: Mothers tell their daughters to avoid sketchy guys and situations. They try to be realistic about what can happen in this fallen world. That is not the same as saying that women are to blame when they're a bit na\u00efve or shy and tongue-tied in a situation that becomes sexual. And I think those things are being confused.

they can be. They called it the \u201cwomen's march\u201d but I refuse to call it by that name. Truth is, by calling that vulgar display of hate and bitterness a \u201cwomen's march\u201d we are actually demeaning and degrading what it means to be female. Think I'm kidding? Think I'm exaggerating? Think I'm anti-woman, anti-feminist, anti-female empowerment? Well, behold, the logical fallacy that is modern day feminism. Nothing says, \u201ctake me seriously\u201d like marching around in pink hats screaming profanities and demanding free things. Does that look like female empowerment to you?

Write: Kevin Love's message on mental health, feminism and abortion, fashion and sexualization, guns","summary":"I would like to thank former Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Love for being brave enough to open up about his mental health. In a message discussed in a March 6 blog post by the Star Tribune's Michael Rand, Love described exactly what an anxiety attack feels like and the shame one feels having a terrible illness that no one can see. He is helping to make depression and anxiety not such a taboo topic. Every person who shares such a story will make it easier for people to talk about mental illnesses, and we can only hope that someday the stigma and discrimination will disappear. It is difficult to live with these illnesses, but feeling like you need to hide away in isolation is by far worse.","published_at":1520816398,"content_id":"5dfa16e0-8d46-34ac-ac50-825b9696fd81","content_url":"http:\/\/www.startribune.com\/readers-write-attention-to-mental-health-feminism-and-abortion-fashion-and-sexualization-guns\/476182023\/","content_published_at":1520464860,"content_time":1520464860,"content_relative_time":619,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Feminism","vibe_id":"86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":619,"comment_relative_time":619,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

Too many people still think AI for sales will resemble C-3PO, a bumbling assistant that gets in the way more often than not, or the Hal 9000, subverting the sales process in ways that endanger the very existence of the sales person. As the discussions mature, and as people learn more about the somewhat arcane inner workings of AI, the reality is becoming clearer: how AI will impact sales and sales people is... complicated. That's mostly because the teaching of these systems -- or \"training,\" in the AI vernacular -- is done by subjecting the systems to large amounts of data.

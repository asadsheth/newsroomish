And as global transactions have increased, the danger has too. Fortunately, artificial intelligence has enormous potential to reduce financial fraud. As automated fraud detection tools get smarter and machine learning becomes more powerful, the outlook should improve exponentially. In its latest report, security company McAfee\u00a0estimates that cybercrime currently costs the global economy some $600\u00a0billion, or 0.8% of global gross domestic product. One of the most prevalent forms and preventable types of cybercrime is credit card fraud, which is exacerbated by the growth in online transacting.

Paul Clarke, Chief Technology Officer at the online supermarket, has given a unique insight into the high-tech workings of the company's warehouse where 65,000 orders are picked by robots every week.\u00a0 The army of robots, connected wirelessly over 4G, make up\u00a0the key part of Ocado's\u00a0'Hive' system at its\u00a0Andover warehouse. Mr Clarke has told the latest episode of the Telegraph's Technology Intelligence podcast that \"these robots live in a two dimensional world that's a bit like a huge chessboard so they live on the chessboard and under every single chess square there is a stack of bins containing groceries and the robots move about like rooks.\" The robots surf on top of a huge three-dimensional stack of crates which each contain any of 50,000 products that customers can order. These crates themselves are automatically moved around this 'Hive' structure to enable the robots on top to lower a grabbing arm to collect the items and then deliver them in order to the human at the end of the chain who simply places them in to the box to be delivered to the customer. You can see video footage of the Hive swarm of robots in action in the video above.\u00a0 Mr Clarke adds \"From our point of view artificial intelligence is the one to rule them all when it comes to the set of disruptive technologies that power our business and we already make extensive use of machine learning across our platform. But really we just think we're getting started.\" One example of this is how Ocado's systems will flag early signals that any of their individual robots might be developing a problem, allowing them to carry out what he labels 'predictive maintenance' to allow the system to keep running smoothly. The company is also closely monitoring developments in drone technology, as a potential future solution to the challenge of the 'last mile' in the process - actually getting the groceries to your front door.\u00a0 Also in this week's podcast, which focuses on the Future of Food, Harry de Quetteville\u00a0examines how technology will disrupt the way our food is grown, reared, processed, sold and delivered. With a rapidly growing population, can tech offer us the answer to feed future generations? How close are we to being able to grow meat in the lab that tastes indistinguishable from the real thing? Prof Dr Mark Post from Mosameat gives his predictions for this evolving procedure. \u00a0 We also hear from Will Wells, CEO of Hummingbird Technologies, about the new ways drones are being used to monitor crop health from the skies. Context in this episode is provided by Professor Sir Charles Godfray from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food.

Ukko Agro, named after the Finnish God of agriculture was founded late last year by Ketan Kaushish, who is from New Delhi, and Avi Bhargava, from Kurukshetra in Haryana. It uses the tagline, Helping farmers grow more, sustainably. Its cloud-based predictive system will be deployed in a limited commercial rollout with select growers in three provinces of Canada and five US states. \u201cWhat we plan to do it is helping farmers optimise crop inputs, which is pesticides, water, and more.","published_at":1528037764,"content_id":"f1738739-56d3-3de6-8a46-83123a26350f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/indo-canadians-startup-to-use-artificial-intelligence-to-deliver-hyperlocal-info-on-farming\/story-U5B9B478hPYN4bhu4v7PrL.html","content_published_at":1528036767,"content_time":1528036767,"content_relative_time":50,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence","vibe_id":"106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":50,"comment_relative_time":50,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8a536d53-1433-312d-b939-ed61d7ad1960","post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-47d1de26-e85f-379b-aa68-a0431f49bf9d_a-8a536d53-1433-312d-b939-ed61d7ad1960","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-47d1de26-e85f-379b-aa68-a0431f49bf9d_a-8a536d53-1433-312d-b939-ed61d7ad1960","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/toil-trouble-macbeth-could-teach-2kvc2uj","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"BostonGlobe.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/metro\/2018\/06\/02\/toil-and-trouble-how-macbeth-could-teach-computers-think\/h9kbBEX7BVkp4Rc6XbJrPM\/story.html?s_campaign=bdc:globewell:trending&s_campaign=bdc:globewell:trending","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/F6nSyPJmQ3M8polOLPAzwg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pavweJJmnHl_R1xlYzH9dg--\/dz01ODU7aD0zOTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8a536d53-1433-312d-b939-ed61d7ad1960-566459030.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RLdvhkxNuGvb4uEeTAKdeA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zOTA7dz01ODU7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pavweJJmnHl_R1xlYzH9dg--\/dz01ODU7aD0zOTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8a536d53-1433-312d-b939-ed61d7ad1960-566459030.jpeg","height":390,"width":585,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pavweJJmnHl_R1xlYzH9dg--\/dz01ODU7aD0zOTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8a536d53-1433-312d-b939-ed61d7ad1960-566459030.jpeg","imgw":585,"imgh":390,"title":"Toil and trouble: How 'Macbeth' could teach computers to think","summary":"Patrick Winston's computer is learning about revenge, ambition, and murder.

The computer had to learn these things in order to read \u201cMacbeth\u201d \u2014 or, rather, an extremely truncated version of Shakespeare's blood-soaked Scottish tragedy.

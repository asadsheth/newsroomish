In Southern California, staff at the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said lower-than-average hydro generation may create challenges as natural gas-fired generation - the replacement for hydro production shortfalls in past years - may be limited due to reduced gas storage capacity and local pipeline outages in the region. Nationwide, the staff said North American reliability coordinators forecast demand for electricity from the grid would be about the same as last summer due to increased use of demand response programs to reduce usage and distributed energy resources like home solar panels.","published_at":1526576419,"content_id":"eb44abfa-4c9e-3e2b-adb2-b39ceb5ebc45","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-power-grid-ready-summer-calif-texas-concerns-170114582.html","content_published_at":1526576895,"content_time":1526576895,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Nature","vibe_id":"e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"7c91ab60-9891-3071-87a7-ec5f3fa49d38","post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-d3e8680b-038a-32ca-b9dc-e20664a8e1e5_a-7c91ab60-9891-3071-87a7-ec5f3fa49d38","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e5538064-f661-3c50-977e-1f13546aaa98_c-d3e8680b-038a-32ca-b9dc-e20664a8e1e5_a-7c91ab60-9891-3071-87a7-ec5f3fa49d38","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nature\/wild-foods-foraging-tours-help-gatherers-see-beyond-oujm3yf","author":"third_watch","provider":"Reuters","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-02-01\/973af590-e89a-11e6-b294-9bc8096ac008_reuters.jpg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/wild-foods-foraging-tours-help-gatherers-see-beyond-160737166.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hTEDotZ7ajqpoPfGV.Px8Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-17T160737Z_1_LYNXNPEE4G1DJ_RTROPTP_2_USA-FOOD-FORAGING.JPG","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Qhh2VirxkVlWEnPIS8oG6w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-17T160737Z_1_LYNXNPEE4G1DJ_RTROPTP_2_USA-FOOD-FORAGING.JPG","height":300,"width":450,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2018-05-17T160737Z_1_LYNXNPEE4G1DJ_RTROPTP_2_USA-FOOD-FORAGING.JPG","imgw":450,"imgh":300,"title":"Wild foods foraging tours help gatherers see beyond 'green wall'","summary":"A dozen wild food foragers listened intently to botanist Hayden Stebbins in an upstate New York field, entrusting him to steer them clear of the poisonings and arrests that have plagued others across the United States.

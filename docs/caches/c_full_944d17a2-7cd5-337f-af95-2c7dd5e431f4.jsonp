According to the U.S. Forest Service, the fire is now 100 percent\u00a0contained. The closure order for the vicinity of the fire, including the Van Cliff Loop Trail\/No. 313), has been lifted. Firefighters were pulled from the fire lines Saturday in response to thunder and anticipated thunderstorms in the area, according to Appalachian District Ranger Richard Thornburgh. About half an inch of rain fell across the fire area between Saturday night and Sunday.","published_at":1525722248,"content_id":"37932e38-e219-313b-8919-6d31cb2b0e65","content_url":"https:\/\/www.citizen-times.com\/story\/news\/local\/2018\/05\/07\/appalachian-trail-near-hot-springs-reopens-after-deer-park-fire\/587124002\/","content_published_at":1525721818,"content_time":1525721818,"content_relative_time":212,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":212,"comment_relative_time":212,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"82aa1775-b9dc-3d3e-99a1-5ed4e90c0232","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-34dc1e65-307c-3641-ac4a-4ddbc150a295_a-82aa1775-b9dc-3d3e-99a1-5ed4e90c0232","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-34dc1e65-307c-3641-ac4a-4ddbc150a295_a-82aa1775-b9dc-3d3e-99a1-5ed4e90c0232","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/valencia-brush-fire-burns-20-1jokfkk","author":"nanook","provider":"KABC \u2013 Los Angeles","provider_url":"http:\/\/abclocal.go.com\/kabc\/index","provider_image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/os\/152\/2012\/10\/25\/kabc-44x70-png_145514.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/valencia-brush-fire-burns-20-022856314.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ZJj8JM7MNSP9UYRyx9YQKw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.kabc.abc.news.com\/38c027a383c917d313009b463bd241bb","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LUdO7OFUlpR5vijv2cQeTw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.kabc.abc.news.com\/38c027a383c917d313009b463bd241bb","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.kabc.abc.news.com\/38c027a383c917d313009b463bd241bb","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Valencia brush fire burns 20 acres","summary":null,"published_at":1525657739,"content_id":"82aa1775-b9dc-3d3e-99a1-5ed4e90c0232","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/valencia-brush-fire-burns-20-022856314.html","content_published_at":1525660136,"content_time":1525660136,"content_relative_time":229,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"video_link","aspect":1.7800000000000000266453525910037569701671600341796875},"created_at":0,"comment_time":229,"comment_relative_time":229,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"31842702-8296-36ac-a070-69a17be16b15","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-f0e0ec9c-f850-3ffe-b645-3fa695fc1857_a-31842702-8296-36ac-a070-69a17be16b15","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-f0e0ec9c-f850-3ffe-b645-3fa695fc1857_a-31842702-8296-36ac-a070-69a17be16b15","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/vegetation-fire-breaks-ramona-p7a0tql","author":"nanook","provider":"Escondido, CA Patch","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/patch.com\/california\/escondido\/s\/gez94\/wildland-fire-breaks-out-ramona","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_VBhdRdBa5HshiH2zekj0g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pqG4YJvqbZ3aBh2Eal_rbg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_31842702-8296-36ac-a070-69a17be16b15-187505260.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dDibkmLnJdwGiLxqSiWWvg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MDA7dz04MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pqG4YJvqbZ3aBh2Eal_rbg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_31842702-8296-36ac-a070-69a17be16b15-187505260.jpeg","height":600,"width":800,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/pqG4YJvqbZ3aBh2Eal_rbg--\/dz04MDA7aD02MDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_31842702-8296-36ac-a070-69a17be16b15-187505260.jpeg","imgw":800,"imgh":600,"title":"Vegetation Fire Breaks Out In Ramona","summary":"RAMONA, CA -- A vegetation fire broke out Saturday afternoon at a riverbed in Ramona.

Will we have another record-breaking fire season in B.C.? Will there be another Fort McMurray fire this year? Will it be a quiet year, given all the snow this past winter and the cold and wet spring thus far? Good questions all. I am not sure what the 2018 fire season will bring, as it depends on the day-to-day weather (read hot, dry and windy) during the fire season. Though I can tell you that a cold and wet winter, and\/or spring, has virtually no impact on the fire season. Recall last year: flooding in B.C. in the spring, followed by a summer of fire and smoke.

The fire covered about 250 acres in Newaygo County near Bills Lake. Firefighters responded Tuesday and officials say cooler temperatures and a decrease in winds helped the flames die down. No injuries were reported and a few homes were evacuated as a precaution. The cause of the fire wasn't immediately known. Other smaller fires were reported elsewhere in the state. The National Weather Service had issued a red flag warning Tuesday for Michigan's entire Lower Peninsula, saying high winds, dry conditions and warm temperatures could cause wildfires to quickly spread.","published_at":1525274113,"content_id":"1ee067db-b206-34a2-b371-89853e4fba07","content_url":"https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/news\/local\/michigan\/2018\/05\/02\/michigan-wildfire-contained\/34481451\/","content_published_at":1525276258,"content_time":1525276258,"content_relative_time":336,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":336,"comment_relative_time":336,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

From the devastating blazes that reduced more than a million acres of California to ashes late last year to the ferocious flames that tragically killed 66 people in Portugal, 2017 was a record year for wildfires. Across southern Europe, lives were lost and homes destroyed as dry, hot weather and strong winds led to a doubling of the usual number of forest fires; meanwhile, in the US the forest service spent a record $2bn tackling the problem. Furthermore, while 2017 was a dramatic year, experts fear we could see more of the same in the years ahead as a combustible combination of climate-change induced extreme weather and increasing levels of human activity in fire-risk areas fuels longer and more severe fire seasons.","published_at":1518617010,"content_id":"83171e47-71fd-35ec-a33f-6826e0d220e8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theengineer.co.uk\/aerial-firefighting-technology\/","content_published_at":1518597022,"content_time":1518597022,"content_relative_time":396,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":396,"comment_relative_time":396,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716","post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-aed5dda4-d8d3-3ae9-90bd-933721645164_a-79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-aed5dda4-d8d3-3ae9-90bd-933721645164_a-79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/couple-still-rebuilding-fort-mcmurray-1nxkzl5","author":"nanook","provider":"globalnews.ca","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/4022197\/couple-who-are-still-rebuilding-after-fort-mcmurray-wildfire-wins-1m-lottery-prize\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/j1UJD7YsWsavdPbcv.BO4A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4zmWzyHd.kKIPTBl0V2ucg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716--1915603790.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LLjx0x_aR0iCdOtMEXSlIQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00ODA7dz03MjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4zmWzyHd.kKIPTBl0V2ucg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716--1915603790.jpeg","height":480,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4zmWzyHd.kKIPTBl0V2ucg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_79245bb8-d619-3b57-883b-7105f5fe2716--1915603790.jpeg","imgw":720,"imgh":480,"title":"Couple who are still rebuilding after Fort McMurray wildfire wins $1M lottery prize","summary":"A Fort McMurray man, who bought a winning Lotto 649 ticket while visiting his ailing father in Newfoundland, says he and his wife plan to use their $1 million prize to finish rebuilding their home after the 2016 wildfire.

Many of the homes were horse properties. The fire has burned about 170 acres and was about 85 percent contained at 2:30 p.m. Copter4 flew over the fire as it spread near homes. Two homes were evacuated and several others were placed on pre-evacuation status. The evacuation for the homes was lifted but the pre-evacuation remained in effect.

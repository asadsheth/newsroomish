Evidence has emerged in some studies that \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d about changes that had left them behind may have had less to do with Trump voters' choices than anxiety about other, more complex social changes that seemed to be slipping beyond the voters' control. Instead of economic hardship, University of Pennsylvania political scientist Diana Mutz writes in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, after analyzing data from 2012 and 2016, \u201cit was about dominant groups that felt threatened by change and a candidate who took advantage of that trend.\u201d For those voters, Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d theme called up visions of a comforting past, whether it ever actually existed or not.","published_at":1526426141,"content_id":"07783feb-db0b-307c-818e-419032b52607","content_url":"http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/opinion\/page\/ct-perspec-page-kanye-west-donald-trump-stanley-greenberg-20180515-story.html","content_published_at":1526420400,"content_time":1526420400,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Kanye West","vibe_id":"516a21f6-d46f-3f14-84d6-f35062ffbbf1","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854","post_id":"v-516a21f6-d46f-3f14-84d6-f35062ffbbf1_c-7153e1e0-0f95-3e5a-a3cf-b01aa27732ef_a-9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-516a21f6-d46f-3f14-84d6-f35062ffbbf1_c-7153e1e0-0f95-3e5a-a3cf-b01aa27732ef_a-9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/kanye-west\/romeo-langford-shares-prowess-fortnite-5gawqw2","author":"nanook","provider":"Indianapolis Star","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.indystar.com\/story\/news\/2018\/05\/14\/iu-recruit-romeo-langford-probably-beat-you-fortnite-kanye-west-twitter-high-school-sports\/606841002\/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=indystar\/todaystopstories","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gdlH02BMhBiAMU5vcYvPaA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GraSc9d2bJbvmrbVRPOpbQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854--1485180699.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Cc.DttP.DWZqX.DzLoI4WA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GraSc9d2bJbvmrbVRPOpbQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854--1485180699.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GraSc9d2bJbvmrbVRPOpbQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9fa594cb-9161-3ec8-9f72-fbdc553eb854--1485180699.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"Romeo Langford shares prowess on 'Fortnite' and Mr. Football dishes on Kanye West","summary":"IndyStar's Justin Mack caught up with the (then un-announced) IU recruit on the red carpet prior to the April 29 Indiana Sports Awards.

Under the proposals, unanimously backed by the ECB board, each side would face 15 six-ball overs, culminating in a final 10 deliveries -- 20 balls shorter than traditional Twenty20 matches. The latest format, which follows experiments with 40-, 50- and 60-over competitions, as well as four-day county championship matches and T20 contests, was presented to chairmen and chief executives of the county clubs and the MCC on Thursday. It is due to launch in 2020. \"This is a","published_at":1524193547,"content_id":"5986c7c8-5e2a-322d-924e-6f28d61a913c","content_url":"http:\/\/www.thestar.com.my\/sport\/cricket\/2018\/04\/19\/england-to-host-100ball-domestic-competition-from-2020\/","content_published_at":1524152160,"content_time":1524152160,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ed06f542-efa1-3fef-94e5-b93378fcaff2","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-0a5214ec-7a19-3d89-961e-c22d3f13c016_a-ed06f542-efa1-3fef-94e5-b93378fcaff2","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-0a5214ec-7a19-3d89-961e-c22d3f13c016_a-ed06f542-efa1-3fef-94e5-b93378fcaff2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/bksp-commute-hell-64v8ntr","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"thedailystar.net","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.thedailystar.net\/sports\/bangladesh-cricket\/bksp-the-commute-hell-1564975","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gNFq3I8KzbhkT7GnirsrVQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kcqd32wLZgdM8wOl.BUNKw--\/dz01NjA7aD0yOTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ed06f542-efa1-3fef-94e5-b93378fcaff2-1189431643.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/q6ucRpAYBaxlNBgvvTY7yA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yOTI7dz01NjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kcqd32wLZgdM8wOl.BUNKw--\/dz01NjA7aD0yOTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ed06f542-efa1-3fef-94e5-b93378fcaff2-1189431643.jpeg","height":292,"width":560,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kcqd32wLZgdM8wOl.BUNKw--\/dz01NjA7aD0yOTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ed06f542-efa1-3fef-94e5-b93378fcaff2-1189431643.jpeg","imgw":560,"imgh":292,"title":"BKSP: The commute from hell","summary":"If a player is extremely lucky, a 50-over cricket match will take 14 hours of his time.

Still trying to master craft of swing bowling","summary":"Calcutta: Trent Boult, who has quickly emerged as a leading new-ball bowler in the past few years, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to

The New Zealander is in his debut year with the Delhi DareDevils, his third franchise in the numero uno T20 league, and arrived in India on the back of superb performances against England at home. A relaxed Boult took all questions, without even suggesting that he was actually getting late for an informal session of the DareDevils. A England are a quality side, so I was satisfied with my performances... Test cricket is, as you know, my favourite and a very fine team effort helped New Zealand win a series against the visitors after almost two decades.","published_at":1524049040,"content_id":"c0c0719f-8e79-38a6-90f4-30edfd9947ff","content_url":"https:\/\/www.telegraphindia.com\/sports\/boult-still-trying-to-master-craftof-swing-bowling-223980?ref=indian-premier-league-lateststory","content_published_at":1523919600,"content_time":1523919600,"content_relative_time":69,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":69,"comment_relative_time":69,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5","post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-c1fb8ed4-5281-3957-b3f1-d91987b71ee7_a-76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-c1fb8ed4-5281-3957-b3f1-d91987b71ee7_a-76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/nottinghamshire-prevail-morning-12-wicket-2jsqg15","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"ESPNcricinfo","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/23200020\/nottinghamshire-prevail-morning-12-wicket-madness","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tRPXYEarAhOpCAjzPyiv9w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KkijVqefrwESMtN_OI.ZcQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5-939185144.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EvcTk5plKctr25M.N5i1sA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03Mjk7dz0xMjk2Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KkijVqefrwESMtN_OI.ZcQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5-939185144.jpeg","height":729,"width":1296,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KkijVqefrwESMtN_OI.ZcQ--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_76105185-d526-38ac-a11b-f37e70e050f5-939185144.jpeg","imgw":1296,"imgh":729,"title":"Nottinghamshire prevail in morning of 12-wicket madness","summary":"Paul Edwards Nottinghamshire 222 (Bailey 3-26, Livingstone 3-27, Mennie 3-46) and 10 for 4 (Mennie 3-4) beat Lancashire 158 (Ball 5-43) and 73 (Gurney 6-25, Ball 4-14) by six wickets Scorecard It was a morning when batsmen came and went like leaders of UKIP; a morning when the rapidity of events boggled the scrambled mind and outstripped the scribbling pen; a morning when 12 wickets fell in exactly 15 overs, Lancashire losing their last eight for 15 runs.

The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, is emblematic of the reckoning clergy abuse victims increasingly are demanding for the damage inflicted on them by church leaders after they reported their alleged abuse. Pope Francis recently acknowledged making \"grave errors\" and apologized to victims in Chile.","published_at":1523581366,"content_id":"4dbc75cd-4563-3845-976d-b60239412f6a","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/wires\/ap\/article-5609009\/Victims-seek-compensation-abuse-reckoning.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","content_published_at":1523550991,"content_time":1523550991,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Religion","vibe_id":"1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28","post_id":"v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-8ddb5537-f01e-3070-92bf-4a0bb5791855_a-28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-8ddb5537-f01e-3070-92bf-4a0bb5791855_a-28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/religion\/fishermans-tomb-truth-behind-great-64y0bfz","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"CNS News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnsnews.com\/commentary\/john-oneill\/fishermans-tomb-truth-behind-great-search-apostle-peter","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/f7pCHE_TbkywUDWOlQkuaw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/G1UXV5sDdJeBmKFnjsFInA--\/dz01Njc7aD0yOTc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28--1968131528.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/n_7D4BoUkb7DeB2NIarxlA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yOTc7dz01Njc7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/G1UXV5sDdJeBmKFnjsFInA--\/dz01Njc7aD0yOTc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28--1968131528.jpeg","height":297,"width":567,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/G1UXV5sDdJeBmKFnjsFInA--\/dz01Njc7aD0yOTc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28--1968131528.jpeg","imgw":567,"imgh":297,"title":"'The Fisherman's Tomb': The Truth Behind the Great Search for the Apostle Peter","summary":"Deep under the Vatican lies one of the world's greatest archaeological and religious wonders. Beginning 75 years ago, the Vatican began a secret search for the tomb of the Apostle Peter, whom legend said was buried on Vatican Hill after his execution by the Roman Emperor, Nero, in 66 A.D. Peter was Christ's most important lieutenant and, with Paul, one of the most important figures in early Christianity. Ultimately, after floods, cave-ins, and many twists and turns, the search found Peter's relics, as well as a vast Roman necropolis of house-sized tombs and early first, second and third century inscriptions secretly carved on stone walls by early Christians. All of these had been covered for 1700 years since the construction of the original St. Peter's in 330 A.D.","published_at":1523565130,"content_id":"28e64390-b171-3088-a124-5f7a355ebf28","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnsnews.com\/commentary\/john-oneill\/fishermans-tomb-truth-behind-great-search-apostle-peter","content_published_at":1523564281,"content_time":1523564281,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Religion","vibe_id":"1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"06903d3d-6bc2-3775-bbe4-48187c265f57","post_id":"v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-1e6ad874-707c-34c3-9820-f0b4e1fb6cb4_a-06903d3d-6bc2-3775-bbe4-48187c265f57","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-1e6ad874-707c-34c3-9820-f0b4e1fb6cb4_a-06903d3d-6bc2-3775-bbe4-48187c265f57","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/religion\/community-were-jewish-harvard-students-wb6a44p","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Forward","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/forward.com\/scribe\/398680\/were-jewish-harvard-students-and-we-were-arrested-last-week-over-israel\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Community | We're Jewish Harvard Students \u2014 And We Were Arrested Last Week Over Israel","summary":"Last week, we were arrested for participating in a sit-in outside the Israeli Consulate.

Korea's national security adviser in U.S. to meet Bolton","summary":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Korea's national security adviser was in Washington on Wednesday for his first meeting with his new American counterpart, John Bolton, U.S. officials said, amid preparations for separate U.S. and South Korean summits with North Korea. Chung Eui-yong, who is due to see Bolton on Thursday, led the South Korean delegation that met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month and then travelled to the United States to convey to President Donald Trump a summit invitation from Kim. Trump accepted. He said on Monday that he planned to meet Kim in May or early June and hoped the discussions would ultimately lead to an end of the North's nuclear weapons program.

It will also serve as a test of whether the fond personal relationship the two leaders have forged on the golf course and over meetings and phone calls has chilled over Trump's recent moves, including his failure to exempt Japan from new steel and aluminum tariffs. \"We expect it to be very positive,\" White House","published_at":1523948475,"content_id":"6e3cd815-cd5a-3a72-8300-dcbd932e2ade","content_url":"http:\/\/www.wral.com\/trump-to-host-japan-s-abe-amid-strain-over-n-korea-tariffs\/17491633\/","content_published_at":1523954374,"content_time":1523954374,"content_relative_time":13,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions","vibe_id":"0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":13,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"0fc9a7c5-7466-38b4-98cd-91393e4827a9","post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c318dcaf-5f36-3df2-bb36-86fc408499dd_a-0fc9a7c5-7466-38b4-98cd-91393e4827a9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c318dcaf-5f36-3df2-bb36-86fc408499dd_a-0fc9a7c5-7466-38b4-98cd-91393e4827a9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c318dcaf-5f36-3df2-bb36-86fc408499dd_a-0fc9a7c5-7466-38b4-98cd-91393e4827a9","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"AFP","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.afp.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2016-10-05\/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/chinas-zte-halts-share-trading-following-us-export-032612456--finance.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mLPVotQd.r3gm3Y30K3TLg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/5f1330b5171d11845d6e98337dc2a9f4c6088ed5.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/R5If_IxXCei6vkBXtUdx0w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODE7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/5f1330b5171d11845d6e98337dc2a9f4c6088ed5.jpg","height":681,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/5f1330b5171d11845d6e98337dc2a9f4c6088ed5.jpg","imgw":1024,"imgh":681,"title":"China's ZTE halts share trading following US export ban","summary":"Chinese telecom giant ZTE halted trading of its shares in Hong Kong and Shenzhen Tuesday following a US ban on its purchase of sensitive technology, which drew a pledge by China to \"safeguard\" its companies if necessary.

Businesses, schools and hospitals including the NHS were brought to their knees by the malicious software after\u00a0it spread in May.\u00a0 Tom Bossert, President Donald Trump\u2019s security adviser said that the rogue Asian state was \"directly responsible\"\u00a0for the malware that spread \u201cindiscriminately\u201d. \u00a0He said that officials had investigated the matter and had evidence to suggest the attack came from North Korea. \"North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behaviour is growing more egregious,\"\u00a0he wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \"WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless. As we make the internet safer, we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us, whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organizations or hostile nations.\" WannaCry ransomware victims were met with a red screen asking them to deposit Bitcoin in return for their files Credit: EPA He hinted that Mr Trump might take action, adding: \"the tool kits of totalitarian regimes are too threatening to ignore\". It comes as Mr Trump plugged his new national security strategy with a focus on cyber defence.\u00a0 The White House will give an official statement blaming Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime on Tuesday.\u00a0It confirms British security chiefs\u2019 conclusions about Pyongyang\u2019s involvement earlier this year.\u00a0 In October, security minister Ben Wallace said that he was \u201cas sure as possible\u201d that North Korea was to blame. About | WannaCry This morning foreign office\u00a0minister for cyber, Lord Ahmad, said the UK \"is determined to identify, pursue and respond to malicious cyber activity regardless of where it originates, imposing costs on those who wish to attack us in cyberspace\". He re-iterated that the National Cyber Security Centre blamed government backed Lazarus Group for the hack.\u00a0 The WannaCry ransomware spread worldwide but only struck computer systems that an out-of-date operating system, Windows 7. Hundreds of NHS clinics and several hospitals were forced to halt surgeries and appointments. Honda, Nissan and Fed Ex also fell victim.\u00a0 WannaCry ransomware map - locations of infection Infected systems presented as a red screen which warned that files had been encrypted. It had a set of instructions and a timer for the owner to deposit Bitcoin by a certain time for the return of their files.\u00a0 British computer whizz Marcus Hutchins, 23, was widely regarded a hero after he figured out a way to stop the malware spreading using a \"kill switch\" but he soon fell from grace after he was arrested by US police while attending a cyber security conference in Las Vegas for his alleged involvement in creating a banking malware called Kronos.\u00a0 Hutchins was arrested on August 2 as he waited to catch a flight home and has been bailed but banned from leaving the country and is under house arrest, but is allowed online where he can regularly be found tweeting updates.\u00a0 Hutchins awaits trial after pleading not guilty to six charges related to Kronos and faces up to 40 years in jail.","published_at":1513693053,"content_id":"e36c1e97-6657-39fc-ab8f-1d6e8fce2b23","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/us-blames-north-korea-wannacry-095325182.html","content_published_at":1513677205,"content_time":1513677205,"content_relative_time":32,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"InfoSec","vibe_id":"b7ceb013-9918-317e-ba58-bdb2987cf440","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":32,"comment_relative_time":32,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a7128167-0d03-391a-ad14-a920da9e2802","post_id":"v-b7ceb013-9918-317e-ba58-bdb2987cf440_c-5000a8cc-7a0c-3402-983b-15bd66308732_a-a7128167-0d03-391a-ad14-a920da9e2802","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom

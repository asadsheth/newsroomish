Screens flashed red with a ransom note that read, \u201cOoops, your files have been encrypted\u201d and demanded a payment of between $300 and $600 (\u00a3230 and \u00a3470) in bitcoin .\u00a0 The attack, called \u201cWannaCry\u201d, spread rapidly across 150 countries. Within hours of Spanish mobile operator Telefonica first announcing it had been hacked, NHS hospitals reported they too were having problems. It was the beginning of a crisis that would last three days and affect more than 200,000 computers, belonging to the likes of Renault, FedEx and Dutch railway company Deutsche Bahn. But nowhere was the pain felt more acutely than in the UK.\u00a0 By lunchtime that Friday, NHS hospitals and GP surgeries were turning away patients and ambulances, cancelling operations and asking people to only seek medical care in an emergency. The country was, by then, used to hacks on a massive scale, but not to ones that threatened lives. Although Robert Hannigan had resigned as head of GCHQ four months earlier, he kept his finger on the pulse of Britain\u2019s computer networks and watched the WannaCry attack unfold.\u00a0 \u201cThe NHS had thought it wasn\u2019t a target, but found it couldn\u2019t operate at all. It was completely paralysed,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a huge wake up call.\u201d The hackers, reportedly from North Korea, didn\u2019t intentionally target the UK\u2019s health service: it was collateral damage. WannaCry entered computers through a glitch, discovered by the US National Security Agency, in early Windows operating systems. The 33 affected NHS practices were hit because they hadn\u2019t updated their Windows XP software for many years. \u201cThe problem for the NHS isn\u2019t so much cyber security, it\u2019s that their basic infrastructure is so creaky and old fashioned that it\u2019s open to attack,\u201d says Hannigan. Robert Hannigan was director of GCHQ from 2014 to 2017\u00a0 Credit: Ben Birchall\u00a0\/PA It might not be his responsibility any longer, but the former GCHQ chief is eager to bring the UK into the 21st century and do all he can to stop hackers winning.\u00a0 \u201cTen years ago it was hard to get anyone interested,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAs more and more people have direct experience of hacks and fraud, they are getting the message that it really matters.\u201d The 53-year-old is more career bureaucrat than web sleuth, as evidenced by the grey suit and spotted tie he is wearing when we meet.\u00a0 But his cyber CV is impressive. In 2009, when he was security advisor to then prime minister Gordon Brown, Hannigan created the world\u2019s first national cyber security strategy, which predicted many of the threats to come. Launching the report, Lord Alan West said, \u201cWe know that various state actors are very interested in cyber warfare. The terrorist aspect of this is the least concern, but it is developing.\u201d Almost a decade later, North Korea would be suspected of authoring the WannaCry attack and Russian hackers would be found inside British critical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the internet would be a known breeding ground for extremists who saw the UK as a target. In 2014, Hannigan moved to GCHQ to steer it into a new era of transparency. It was a year after the agency had suffered from one of the biggest leaks in history: Edward Snowden\u2019s mass surveillance revelations. Its reputation was in tatters.\u00a0 Hannigan thought openness would be the best policy and, as such, oversaw the launch of GCHQ\u2019s first Twitter account and opening of the public-facing National Cyber Security Centre. His mission didn\u2019t stop at repairing the agency\u2019s standing; he also wanted to educate the public. Fear and ignorance would do no longer. \u201cThis affects everybody, including individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit back and wait. We should focus on identifying talent that hasn\u2019t been discovered yet and developing it.\u201d Hannigan thought GCHQ needed to change after the Edward Snowden revelations Credit: Laura Poitras One of the biggest problems facing the UK, as WannaCry showed, is a lack of technical proficiency. There just aren\u2019t enough defenders in the face of highly trained foreign criminals and state-sponsored hackers, Hannigan explains. \u201cIn North Korea and Russia there has been a lot of state investment in agency cyber skills,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put countries in a league table, but they have very sophisticated people out there.\u201d In Britain, meanwhile, computer security is poorly taught and aptitude is seldom nurtured. This is, in part, because teachers can\u2019t keep up with the pace of technological change or the constantly evolving threat hackers pose. \u201cSo much of the cyber security training that\u2019s out there is very old-fashioned,\u201d says Hannigan. \u201cIt\u2019s dull, it\u2019s slow and it\u2019s classroom-based. We have to break out of that and find something that\u2019s generationally appropriate.\u201d At GCHQ, he helped develop the Cyber First programme for young people, including a girls-only summer school. He now chairs the advisory board of a Bristol-based start-up called Immersive Labs, which uses online games to spot cyber talent and train it. It was founded by his former GCHQ colleague James Hadley and is aimed at users with no technical knowledge, who have a natural aptitude for analytical thinking, problem solving, research\u00a0- and Sudoku. \u201cParents need to get over their technology fear and snobbery,\u201d he urges. \u201cThere\u2019s massive potential here for their children and grandchildren to have a career in this. For the next 10 years, at least, cyber security skills are going to be massively in demand. Young people can name their price if they have the right skills.\u201d Will his children, aged 12 and 17, pursue careers in cyber? \u201cMy daughter is big into maths\u2026But I wouldn\u2019t dare predict it,\u201d he admits. Hannigan is still working with the Government on the Defence Innovation Advisory Panel Credit: Jay Williams\u00a0\/Telegraph Hannigan\u2019s hopes for Immersive Labs go far beyond children; he wants to train parents to be computer defenders, too. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t write themselves off because they\u2019re the wrong generation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe beauty of cyber is that you can play around and teach yourself. You don\u2019t need to have been doing it since you were eight. You just need to get over the fear of technology.\u201d Immersive Labs\u2019 prime user is a mid-career adult who has never thought themselves technically capable. The company has recently launched a programme for training veterans and this summer will release one for women returning to work after having children. If Immersive Labs and Hannigan are anything to go by, the country has come a long way in the past decade. In 2008, Hannigan was a technophobe who would sit down with an instruction manual before turning on a new gadget. Now, he\u2019s confident experimenting with and talking about new technology. Immersive Labs, meanwhile, can only exist because of the changed culture at GCHQ. \u201cTen years ago, if you left GCHQ to set up a company, you were frozen out and seen as a traitor,\u201d says Hannigan. \u201cWe now see it as a national project. The more people we can spin out to run companies, the better. The threat is so huge for the whole economy, you can\u2019t expect one government agency to mitigate it.\u201d The fight doesn\u2019t end with education. Hannigan\u2019s other suggestions have included the creation of an international cyber war treaty. In the meantime, he welcomes the news that all NHS computers will be upgraded to Windows 10 and that the Government will spend \u00a3150 million in the next three years to improve the service\u2019s security. How likely is another attack on the scale of WannaCry?\u00a0 \u201cFor the next five to 10 years, things will probably get a lot worse. Crime is on the rise and, with geopolitical instability, countries are prepared to do reckless things,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think people should panic, but everybody needs to take it seriously.

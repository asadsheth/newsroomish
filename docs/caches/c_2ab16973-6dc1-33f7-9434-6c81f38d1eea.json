DML Desk Supervisor Yuntian Hu, the creator of the project, presided over the event, helping first time users get acclimated to the controls while they explored the life of the famous writer, civil rights activist and NAACP co-founder.","published_at":1520334595,"content_id":"b2e22cfe-ce18-32f2-bd5c-aa44238004ae","content_url":"https:\/\/dailycollegian.com\/2018\/03\/after-du-bois-150th-anniversary-vr-trial-whats-next\/","content_published_at":1520323200,"content_time":1520323200,"content_relative_time":37,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":37,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64","post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-064be637-6785-3174-a01a-1e47217ab726_a-5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-064be637-6785-3174-a01a-1e47217ab726_a-5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-064be637-6785-3174-a01a-1e47217ab726_a-5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64","author":"third_watch","provider":"CIO","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/3260187\/virtual-reality\/arvr-gets-real-3-promising-pilots-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-in-business.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/f.SaY0DwEALonNnZ6QvZ3Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U1hIu9sZ1_EHImyoVDHGOA--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64-1860101128.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XO4JMdXcTcb9a7PFlRUF8g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00Njc7dz03MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U1hIu9sZ1_EHImyoVDHGOA--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64-1860101128.jpeg","height":467,"width":700,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U1hIu9sZ1_EHImyoVDHGOA--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64-1860101128.jpeg","imgw":700,"imgh":467,"title":"AR\/VR gets real: 3 promising pilots of augmented reality and virtual reality in business","summary":"General Electric, Boeing, Ford are among the several leading companies that prize augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies for enabling employees to inspect and design machines more efficiently.

The results revealed that people who were more disgusted by certain odors such as urine and sweat were also more likely to vote for Donald Trump than those who were less sensitive.\u00a0 Sense of smell, or olfaction, has been studied extensively by psychologists, revealing that scents have the","published_at":1519793061,"content_id":"4ca106be-6326-3d63-baf6-b4edd32393d1","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/health\/article-5442553\/Sense-SMELL-predicts-vote.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","content_published_at":1519795030,"content_time":1519795030,"content_relative_time":184,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":184,"comment_relative_time":184,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"db8d34c7-6927-3e20-8eb5-6a3e3acae78f","post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-958f144d-fa07-3450-ab0d-2ed916c0e4c7_a-db8d34c7-6927-3e20-8eb5-6a3e3acae78f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-958f144d-fa07-3450-ab0d-2ed916c0e4c7_a-db8d34c7-6927-3e20-8eb5-6a3e3acae78f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/virtual-reality-treatment-burn-patients-33mi8eu","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"fox10tv.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.fox10tv.com\/story\/37607155\/virtual-reality-treatment-for-burn-patients","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CC1fFOr0NuxH5i25dcqWmw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x.Mb3G6eVh8jZeuVMdbUUw--\/dz02NDA7aD0zNjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_db8d34c7-6927-3e20-8eb5-6a3e3acae78f--662456454.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CC1fFOr0NuxH5i25dcqWmw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x.Mb3G6eVh8jZeuVMdbUUw--\/dz02NDA7aD0zNjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_db8d34c7-6927-3e20-8eb5-6a3e3acae78f--662456454.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/x.Mb3G6eVh8jZeuVMdbUUw--\/dz02NDA7aD0zNjA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_db8d34c7-6927-3e20-8eb5-6a3e3acae78f--662456454.jpeg","imgw":640,"imgh":360,"title":"Virtual reality treatment for burn patients","summary":"MOBILE, AL (WALA) - Over the past few years, virtual reality has taken off in a number of industries - including the medical field.

Variety recently cited the Greenlight Insight's report which forecasted VR revenues to total $75 billion by 2021. According to the same report, VR revenues were projected to reach $7.17 billion by the end of 2017. Which is why it's important that businesses both small and large consider early exposure to this growing segment. Promising statistics, but how can business owners put this information to good use? MARK.SPACE, a blockchain-powered platform that allows for the creation of 3D websites compatible with VR, poses an interesting solution.

The industry, already busy preparing for transport and logistical challenges, says it would be happy to stay in the EU single market and the customs union after Britain leaves the world's largest trading bloc if it had a say in regulations and a right to make bilateral trade deals. If that's not possible, then it would be better to have no deal and default to World Trade Organisation rules, which mandate a zero percent tariff on Scotch imports into the EU, said Karen Betts,

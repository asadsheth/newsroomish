His post-game interviews in broken English became an internet sensation during that time. His best season in the majors was in 2013 when he had 55 hits and drove in 24 runs for the Blue Jays. A light-hitting infielder, Kawasaki went to the Mariners in 2012 and was briefly teammates with his idol Ichiro Suzuki.","published_at":1522051001,"content_id":"3bbf954e-0e5d-373f-b178-5f85ddbaaf9f","content_url":"http:\/\/www.sacbee.com\/sports\/article206810304.html","content_published_at":1522040400,"content_time":1522040400,"content_relative_time":12,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":12,"comment_relative_time":12,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"93030cd2-51c7-30dc-b0a7-b8db0931f3e7","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-9bc497d0-d827-3b3e-b569-22cf54c78dff_a-93030cd2-51c7-30dc-b0a7-b8db0931f3e7","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-9bc497d0-d827-3b3e-b569-22cf54c78dff_a-93030cd2-51c7-30dc-b0a7-b8db0931f3e7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/familar-mlb-faces-left-looking-1kmhgr1","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Star Tribune","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.startribune.com\/familar-mlb-faces-left-looking-for-work-as-rosters-are-finalized\/477877643\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6R97SjM5iXH2MQALKrt75Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2FPwl6kt3_LbHwNmLc_geQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_93030cd2-51c7-30dc-b0a7-b8db0931f3e7-1817472749.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gmLg0BVVt9nzQY1m2ULSog--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2FPwl6kt3_LbHwNmLc_geQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_93030cd2-51c7-30dc-b0a7-b8db0931f3e7-1817472749.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2FPwl6kt3_LbHwNmLc_geQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_93030cd2-51c7-30dc-b0a7-b8db0931f3e7-1817472749.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Familar MLB faces left looking for work as rosters are finalized","summary":"Cincinnati outfielder Ben Revere, Washington starting pitcher Jeremy Hellickson and St. Louis reliever Jason Motte were among the latest cuts as big-league teams reached a deadline to make roster decisions.

Bullets will make it better","summary":"Free agent pitcher Alex Cobb waited all winter, but he's finally found a new team as he's agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. This assumes he passes the physical, which is no sure thing with the Orioles. David Schoenfield looks at where Cobb fits in with the Orioles. He fills a big need and he makes the Orioles better, but they still seem to be far from competing in the AL East. It is interesting, Schoenfield notes, that Cobb waited out the market and got the contract he was looking for at the start of the winter (or at least the contract that was projected for him). Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner has a broken wrist after being hit in the hand by a fastball by Athletics pitcher Kendall Graveman.","published_at":1521856255,"content_id":"1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bleedcubbieblue.com\/2018\/3\/21\/17146264\/mlb-bullets-alex-cobb-orioles-justin-turner-injury-yankees-red-sox-london-bob-uecker-tough","content_published_at":1521608400,"content_time":1521608400,"content_relative_time":132,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":132,"comment_relative_time":132,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-c0141b39-2018-3e06-9b30-d14988222720_a-6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-c0141b39-2018-3e06-9b30-d14988222720_a-6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-c0141b39-2018-3e06-9b30-d14988222720_a-6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Chillicothe Gazette","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.chillicothegazette.com\/story\/sports\/mlb\/2018\/03\/22\/new-arizona-of-likely-to-start-season-on-dl-with-pec-injury\/33196229\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rzdMJKAIhh_gtXixmihJLA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yFU2I0urHRSsTTFCzG4Ihw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a-31749141.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uuIJ1.FIEVjcnUvAY6UCow--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNjgwO3c9MzIwMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yFU2I0urHRSsTTFCzG4Ihw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a-31749141.jpeg","height":1680,"width":3200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yFU2I0urHRSsTTFCzG4Ihw--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6247e593-6220-36d9-8dfd-fcb6db2c849a-31749141.jpeg","imgw":3200,"imgh":1680,"title":"New Arizona OF likely to start season on DL with pec injury","summary":"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.

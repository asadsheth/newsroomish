Du Bois Library celebrated the 150th anniversary of its namesake on Wednesday, February 28 in part through inviting students on a Virtual Reality Interpretive Trail of the Du Bois Historic Site in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Hosted by the University of Massachusetts Digital Media Lab, I had the great fortune of experiencing the simulation for myself, walking through a green landscape dotted with interactive captions and pictures detailing the legacy of W.E.B Du Bois. DML Desk Supervisor Yuntian Hu, the creator of the project, presided over the event, helping first time users get acclimated to the controls while they explored the life of the famous writer, civil rights activist and NAACP co-founder.","published_at":1520334595,"content_id":"b2e22cfe-ce18-32f2-bd5c-aa44238004ae","content_url":"https:\/\/dailycollegian.com\/2018\/03\/after-du-bois-150th-anniversary-vr-trial-whats-next\/","content_published_at":1520323200,"content_time":1520323200,"content_relative_time":229,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-064be637-6785-3174-a01a-1e47217ab726_a-5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-064be637-6785-3174-a01a-1e47217ab726_a-5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64","author":"third_watch","provider":"CIO","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/3260187\/virtual-reality\/arvr-gets-real-3-promising-pilots-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-in-business.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/f.SaY0DwEALonNnZ6QvZ3Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U1hIu9sZ1_EHImyoVDHGOA--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64-1860101128.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XO4JMdXcTcb9a7PFlRUF8g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00Njc7dz03MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U1hIu9sZ1_EHImyoVDHGOA--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64-1860101128.jpeg","height":467,"width":700,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U1hIu9sZ1_EHImyoVDHGOA--\/dz03MDA7aD00Njc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5171d041-32ef-3884-9094-270c2a678d64-1860101128.jpeg","imgw":700,"imgh":467,"title":"AR\/VR gets real: 3 promising pilots of augmented reality and virtual reality in business","summary":"General Electric, Boeing, Ford are among the several leading companies that prize augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies for enabling employees to inspect and design machines more efficiently.

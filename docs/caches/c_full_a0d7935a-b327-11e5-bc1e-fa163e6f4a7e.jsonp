Johnson\u00a0issued a comprehensive report\u00a0showing that trafficking in Medicaid has fueled the drug crisis and that a correlation exists between states that expanded Medicaid and those that experienced major increases in overdose deaths.","published_at":1521803851,"content_id":"d9c42723-6328-394f-9c81-1dd72c078601","content_url":"http:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2018\/03\/23\/obamacares-medicaid-expansion-helped-fuel-misery-opioid-crisis\/","content_published_at":1521802974,"content_time":1521802974,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":14,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ef12cddc-f00e-3236-a55d-e54819d674eb_a-b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ef12cddc-f00e-3236-a55d-e54819d674eb_a-b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/governor-renews-calls-medicaid-expansion-233w7mj","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"San Francisco Chronicle","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/news\/article\/Northam-to-unveil-special-session-budget-proposal-12769320.php","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/g.QerRkk7jGt4vkskE69Mg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tpOKrMojNA8ULEGo42U5A--\/dz0yMDQ4O2g9MTQ4MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961-114539566.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WlCoLxlpIGTS5eN6fH3HSA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xNDgxO3c9MjA0ODs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tpOKrMojNA8ULEGo42U5A--\/dz0yMDQ4O2g9MTQ4MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961-114539566.jpeg","height":1481,"width":2048,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tpOKrMojNA8ULEGo42U5A--\/dz0yMDQ4O2g9MTQ4MTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b854b9bb-7bfd-3ff4-acf7-4b14117f3961-114539566.jpeg","imgw":2048,"imgh":1481,"title":"Governor renews calls for Medicaid expansion in Virginia","summary":"RICHMOND, Va.

The Democratic governor held a news conference to discuss his budget proposal, which is largely the same as the one former Virginia Gov.

The slog, according to members of leadership, could force Congress to pass a stopgap measure in order to give lawmakers time to finalize the bill and navigate around the Senate's procedural hurdles.","published_at":1521696902,"content_id":"e2578ae9-1a38-3958-a4a0-97d5e4be2098","content_url":"http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/finance\/overnights\/379408-overnight-finance-congress-struggles-to-strike-funding-deal-as","content_published_at":1521583357,"content_time":1521583357,"content_relative_time":75,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":75,"comment_relative_time":75,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f","post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-18fe78e2-fe98-3d0f-97a0-6539c68297eb_a-c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-18fe78e2-fe98-3d0f-97a0-6539c68297eb_a-c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-18fe78e2-fe98-3d0f-97a0-6539c68297eb_a-c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"TheHill","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/healthcare\/379677-collins-extremely-disappointing-obamacare-fix-left-out-of-spending-deal","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sxkG_L56IbCq4EF57uOtRQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/F2jT29M_9nKdVvLePGEBBA--\/dz05ODA7aD01NTE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f-1278920705.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CgDtqt0rCIuHbpEL9HvokA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTE7dz05ODA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/F2jT29M_9nKdVvLePGEBBA--\/dz05ODA7aD01NTE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f-1278920705.jpeg","height":551,"width":980,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/F2jT29M_9nKdVvLePGEBBA--\/dz05ODA7aD01NTE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c80e6a77-f948-3635-9cfe-60c3eb5a086f-1278920705.jpeg","imgw":980,"imgh":551,"title":"Collins: 'Extremely disappointing' ObamaCare fix left out of spending deal","summary":"Sen.

Wild animals have since prospered in the area, including man's best friend: dogs. When residents of Pripyat and Chernobyl evacuated, many people had to leave behind their dogs. Thirty-one years later, puppies now walk around the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), waiting for a pat on the head that will never come. As the documentary Puppies of Chernobyl explains, the animals should be avoided at all costs, since they could carry radioactive particles in their fur. It's estimated that about 900 stray dogs exist around the area and it's unknown just how much (or little) radiation is affecting","published_at":1522717578,"content_id":"16602442-038a-356f-a4c7-d6a66aaf4d3e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/news\/Puppies-Chernobyl-Documentary-44056356","content_published_at":1522682043,"content_time":1522682043,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fa46427b-b4b0-384c-8555-21beae2309eb","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-06209225-e533-3626-9692-fec41f82e4cc_a-fa46427b-b4b0-384c-8555-21beae2309eb","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-06209225-e533-3626-9692-fec41f82e4cc_a-fa46427b-b4b0-384c-8555-21beae2309eb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/dog-rescued-virginia-house-fire-3bfkugg","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Fox News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/03\/30\/dog-rescued-from-virginia-house-fire-in-dramatic-video.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LoOLpt3.GZZn1emjahCeMg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LDp.y9Zg1D4tNcP5915peA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fa46427b-b4b0-384c-8555-21beae2309eb-362689243.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LtRctcxxWCVEtBcZKvFi0g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LDp.y9Zg1D4tNcP5915peA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fa46427b-b4b0-384c-8555-21beae2309eb-362689243.jpeg","height":720,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/LDp.y9Zg1D4tNcP5915peA--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9NzIwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fa46427b-b4b0-384c-8555-21beae2309eb-362689243.jpeg","imgw":1280,"imgh":720,"title":"Dog rescued from Virginia house fire in dramatic video","summary":"A police officer in Virginia jumped into action Sunday to help save a couple's dog after their home caught fire -- and the dramatic rescue was captured by a bodycamera.

Research by digital current account provider Loot shows no animal charities in millennials\u2019 top ten, and that 16 per cent of donations were processed by online fundraising platform Just Giving. While charities in the top ten included Cancer Research (with 15 per cent of donations), the British Heart Foundation (13 per cent) and Crisis UK (5 per cent), no animal charity made the list. A spokesman for Loot said that the data \u201cuncovered the causes that young people in the UK cared about most\u201d. \u201cTwo of the top three most popular charities are dedicated to funding medical research towards the biggest killers in the UK - cancer and heart diseases. \"The remainder of the top ten charities are primarily focused on helping the disadvantaged in the UK, including the vulnerable elderly and those who have a severe disability. How do millennials spend their money? \u201cNoticeable absences from the top ten included any environmental or animal welfare charities.\" The position of JustGiving at the top of the lists suggests that young donors prefer to give to charities that their friends support. The platform, which takes a 5 per cent fee from any donation it processes, is often used by people taking part in sponsored events for charity. The site\u2019s pages are often shared on social media, and donors can see the names of others that have given money, and the amount they gave. Ollie Purdue, founder and CEO of Loot, said that JustGiving had \u201cinvigorated the sector\u201d. \u201cDonations are only going to increase as this socially conscious generation enter the workforce and begin climbing the career ladder,\u201d he said.

And given how many bunnies are surrendered within a month or two after the holiday, it might not be such a bad idea, after all. Although there's no exact number of how many rabbits are abandoned after being given as Easter gifts, it's likely close to around 80 percent. In fact, after cats and dogs, bunnies are the most commonly surrendered animal in the US, says The Humane Society.

In a Facebook post, now shared thousands of times, Mrs. Geipel\u00a0said, during her planning period, she and a co-worker heard meowing.\u00a0 A quick look out the window revealed no kitty cat, so they began to search the classroom.

All cattle need identification. If one of my 80 head of cattle gets sick, pregnant or injured, it is critical to identify that bovine so treatments can be recorded. It's also important to know which are aggressive cattle and which are not. Effective herd management requires specific animal identification. At first, I tried using numbers instead of names. As babies were born, each received a numbered ear tag. If I noticed odd or aggressive behavior, I would read the bovine's number and make a mental note to write down my observations. Of course, when I got to the writing part, I would not remember if No. 86 or No. 68 was the problem!

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Ohio could become the 13th state to name a state dog, and the first to recognize the Labrador as such. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Jeffery Rezabek, of Clayton, says he thinks the popular breed would represent Ohio values well because it's a working dog and sporting dog. Rezabek notes that Labradors are trained as rescue dogs, police dogs and therapy dogs and are kept as family pets. He says his own family had Labradors while he was growing up.

Some\u00a0institutions in Britain have already welcomed therapy dogs on to their campuses, including Leeds City College, which last week unveiled its 12-week-old cockapoo puppy called Jeffrey. But it was unclear if the animals were actually doing any good. Now a study by the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, \u00a0has found that when students are allowed to pay with and cuddle therapy dogs their stress levels plummet, and energy and happiness increase. They suggest the dogs should be brought in during exam times to help teenagers cope with the pressure. \u201cThe results were remarkable,\u201d said Dr Stanley Coren, study co-author and professor emeritus of psychology at UBC. \u201cWe found that, even 10 hours later, students still reported slightly less negative emotion, feeling more supported, and feeling less stressed, compared to students who did not take part in the therapy dog session.\u201d Come British colleges have already welcomed dogs\u00a0 Credit: University of British Columbia\u00a0 In the study published today in the journal Stress and Health, researchers surveyed 246 students before and after they spent time in a drop-in therapy dog session. Students were free to pet, cuddle and chat with up to 12 canine companions during the sessions and also filled out questionnaires immediately before and after the session, and again about 10 hours later. Researchers found that stress levels dropped by around 45 per cent, energy increased by roughly 37 per cent and happiness by 27 per cent. \u201cThese sessions clearly provide benefits for students in the short-term, so we think universities should try to schedule them during particularly stressful times, such as around exam periods,\u201d said Assistant Professor of Psychology Frances Chen. \u201cEven having therapy dogs around while students are working on their out-of-class assignments could be helpful.\u201d Dogs could be brought in during stressful periods, like exam time, say experts\u00a0 While previous research suggested female students most the new findings show the dogs benefit men as much as women. \u201cTherapy dog sessions are becoming more popular on university campuses, but there has been surprisingly little research on how much attending a single drop-in therapy dog session actually helps students,\u201d said Emma Ward-Griffin, the study\u2019s lead author and research assistant in the UBC department of psychology. \u201cOur findings suggest that therapy dog sessions have a measurable, positive effect on the wellbeing of university students, particularly on stress reduction and feelings of negativity.\u201d","published_at":1521139884,"content_id":"dd7a4241-98ba-375d-8551-364b4f82ef6e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/university-students-dogs-cuddle-during-173619127.html","content_published_at":1520876179,"content_time":1520876179,"content_relative_time":171,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":171,"comment_relative_time":171,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-b3e9ec0c-9c2e-3fb7-ab97-a7b43f2fb461_a-03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-b3e9ec0c-9c2e-3fb7-ab97-a7b43f2fb461_a-03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-b3e9ec0c-9c2e-3fb7-ab97-a7b43f2fb461_a-03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Investor's Business Daily","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/news\/united-dog-death-fiasco-spirals-to-include-u-s-senator-faa-texas-da\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H.sOFjFsV9BIc6v4zr5OHA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9sTKNRHznbOBeNWfLjD5cA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NTY1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64-1640511351.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dP9aSvrtQSS6ebyHvOP3iA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NjU7dz0xMDAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9sTKNRHznbOBeNWfLjD5cA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NTY1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64-1640511351.jpeg","height":565,"width":1000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9sTKNRHznbOBeNWfLjD5cA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NTY1O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_03e12ef1-407a-389c-bb37-a3630b9b3a64-1640511351.jpeg","imgw":1000,"imgh":565,"title":"United Dog Death Fiasco Spirals To Include U.S. Senator, FAA, Texas DA","summary":"Louisiana Republican Sen.

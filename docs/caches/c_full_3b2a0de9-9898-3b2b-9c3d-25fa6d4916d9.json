Kentucky lawmakers recently passed a 6 percent sales tax on small animal veterinarian visits and care services. Gov. Matt Bevin vetoed House Bill 366 on April 9, but lawmakers overrode the decision. Now, local pet lovers are speaking out against the bill. Jackie Cunningham says owning a pet was a bit more affordable when her kids were growing up. \u201cBack then it probably cost around $100-$150 per year, total,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's astronomically higher than that. I'd say at least four times that.\u201d It's a price Cunningham says she's willing to pay to keep her dog, Scooter, healthy.

It's possible that he could be discharged \u201cin the next day or so,\u201d according to Peter McClelland, a retired Yarmouth K-9 officer who has remained a constant presence at the dog's side. Gannon's funeral was held Wednesday at St. Pius X Church in Yarmouth. McClelland said it's possible that Nero could make a complete recovery and eventually be able to return to work a police dog. It's also possible that he could take an early retirement.

French IT worker Jonathann Daval, 34, on Tuesday\u00a0admitted to killing his wife Alexia, 29, in a case that has gripped the country since her partially burned corpse was spotted in a wood in October. The 29-year-old bank employee\u2019s body was found hidden under tree branches near their town of Gray-la-Ville in eastern France. Her husband had previously insisted that Alexia had gone jogging on October 28 and never came back.\u00a0 Millions were moved by footage of the man dubbed \u201cthe perfect son-in-law\u201d crying at her parents\u2019 side at a press conference and even leading one of the running outings organised across the country in her memory. Tearful: Millions had been moved by Jonathan Daval's appearance alongside his wife's grieving parents Credit: SEBASTIEN BOZON\/AFP But three months after her death and after hours of police questioning, Daval finally admitted on Tuesday to killing his wife. Le Monde said that his shock avowal of guilt after three months playing the victim had unleashed a nationwide sense of \u201cbetrayal of compassion\u201d. \u201cHe says it was an accident, that he did not want to do it, and that he regrets it,\u201d said his lawer Randall Schwerdorffer. His client's motivation, he insisted \"was not criminal\". Controversy: Lawyer Randall Schwerdorffer suggested his client, Jonathann Daval, had murdered his wife because she was 'verbally violent' and 'overbearing' Credit: SEBASTIEN BOZON\/AFP \"There were some very strong tensions in their relationship as a couple,\u201d he said, adding that Daval had been subjected to \u201cverbal violence\u201d from his wife. \"Alexia had an overbearing personality, so he felt diminished, stifled. At one point too many words were said, a fit of anger proved too much, and he couldn't control himself.\" The lawyer\u2019s claim\u00a0drew a furious response from gender equality minister Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa. \u201cI find it totally scandalous to\u00a0tell\u00a0us that \u2018she has an overbearing personality, and that\u2019s why she may have been murdered\u2019,\u201d the minister told RTL.\u00a0 Outraged: France's minister for gender equality Marlene Schiappa \u201cBy saying that, you legitimise\u00a0femicide, you legitimise\u00a0the fact that every three days, a woman is killed by her partner, and I find it extremely dangerous to relay that,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a row, it\u2019s not a crime of passion, it\u2019s a murder. We must stop playing down conjugal violence, stop trying to find excuses. Nothing, nothing justifies beating one\u2019s wife or partner.\u201d The lawyer refused to leave it there, claiming that \u201clots of people talk and create controversies without any deep knowledge of the case\u201d. \u201cLots of journalists knew about the violence at the heart of the couple and that Alexia was behind this violence,\u201d he said. Daval maintains that he acted alone and insists he did not set fire to his wife's body. The murder case appalled the couple's quiet town, with nearly 10,000 people turning out for a silent march in her memory. It prompted\u00a0about 100 prominent French women to urge\u00a0President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u00a0to launch an \u201cemergency plan\u201d to curb sexual violence. Relatives take part in a silent march in Gray on November 5, 2017, in memory of Alexia Daval Credit: \u00a0SEBASTIEN BOZON\/SEBASTIEN BOZON\/AFP\/Getty Images Initially questioned as a witness, Daval explained scratches and bite marks on her hands as coming from an argument with his wife that turned physical on the day before her disappearance. Police arrested Daval on Monday after uncovering fresh evidence. A neighbour had reported hearing a car leave the couple's home on the night before Alexia was reported missing. This tallied with a tracking device on his work car, whose tyre tracks were also discovered close to where Alexia's body was found. A source close to the inquiry also said the body was covered in a sheet that was thought to come from the couple's home. Mrs Daval\u2019s parents were said to be \u201cflabbergasted\u201d. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see it coming at all, they want to understand,\u201d said their lawyer Jean-Marc Florand. But he said they rejected the claim it was \u201can accident\u201d. \"When you strangle someone with bare hands who you can look in the eyes, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cThe play he acted out will cost him very dear in the jurors\u2019 eyes.\u201d Daval has been charged with \u201cmurdering one\u2019s spouse\u201d and faces life in prison at the end of a trial due next year.","published_at":1517415011,"content_id":"ec961551-197a-33b9-b7a4-2daaacac90fd","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/french-minister-criticises-apos-scandalous-160853171.html","content_published_at":1517414933,"content_time":1517414933,"content_relative_time":32,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":32,"comment_relative_time":32,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9a51de2a-8166-361e-9cb5-9141e18929fb","post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-61a5e71e-8302-317b-8f88-dbe33a92c8bb_a-9a51de2a-8166-361e-9cb5-9141e18929fb","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-61a5e71e-8302-317b-8f88-dbe33a92c8bb_a-9a51de2a-8166-361e-9cb5-9141e18929fb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/amy-duggar-wants-adopt-california-kyk59r9","author":"third_watch","provider":"Fox News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/entertainment\/2018\/01\/31\/amy-duggar-wants-to-adopt-california-house-horrors-children.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9zRDWyf3VeJL6kClSGy6Hg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/a80CfKGq1u.fGaKJWyjIuA--\/dz04OTY7aD01MDQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9a51de2a-8166-361e-9cb5-9141e18929fb-11413148.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U4c9dO7onJwqdgmVsKoTkw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MDQ7dz04OTY7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/a80CfKGq1u.fGaKJWyjIuA--\/dz04OTY7aD01MDQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9a51de2a-8166-361e-9cb5-9141e18929fb-11413148.jpeg","height":504,"width":896,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/a80CfKGq1u.fGaKJWyjIuA--\/dz04OTY7aD01MDQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9a51de2a-8166-361e-9cb5-9141e18929fb-11413148.jpeg","imgw":896,"imgh":504,"title":"Amy Duggar wants to adopt California 'house of horrors' children","summary":"Reality television star Amy Duggar said she asked her husband if she could adopt the 13 children kept captive by their parents in a home in California dubbed a \u201chouse of horrors.\u201d Duggar, 31, tweeted Monday: \u201cI just asked Dillon (her husband) and told him I wanted to adopt all 13 Turpin children.

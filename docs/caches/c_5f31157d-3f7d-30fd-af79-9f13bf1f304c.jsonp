The 52-year-old woman and her rapist had planned the rendezvous to have sex in exchange for money early Monday in a lot behind one of NYCHA's Saratoga Village buildings on Saratoga Avenue in Bed-Stuy, police said. Instead, when they met around 3:15 a.m., the man wrapped a belt around her neck and forced her to the ground, before punching and kicking her several times in the face. He then raped the woman, but got spooked and ran off when a garbage truck pulled into the parking lot, police said. He fled west on Halsey Street.

It wouldn't be until August of that year that his family would go to local police in Gunnison County, Colorado, and do the same, according to CBS Denver. His mother, Deborah Sue Rudibaugh, told a local newspaper that her son had disappeared after packing up camping supplies and that she worried Millison had been using drugs. But Randy Martinez, a friend of the missing man, said he always had a sneaking suspicion that Millison's family knew something. \u201cLiterally days before he went missing he told us if anything ever happened to him, it was his family,\u201d Martinez told CBS.

Her family have blamed police cuts for her death. After lying in wait outside the Dorset hairdressers where she worked he knifed her twice in the chest. Ms O'Hara met Thomas on Facebook, and began a relationship with him in the summer of 2015, but ended it later that year after discovering he was married. In November 2015 she reported him to the police following an altercation at her home in Blandford Forum, but on Boxing Day, woke up to find him in her bedroom after he climbed in through a window. Stuart Thomas was jailed for life for the brutal murder of Katrina O'Hara Credit: Universal News and Sport On December 30 police arrested Thomas on suspicion of harassment, but took her mobile phone away to check for threatening messages, something the police watchdog said had left her feeling \"afraid and vulnerable\". The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has now recommended that all police forces ensure domestic abuse victims and those at risk are given alternative means of communication if their phones are retained for investigative purposes. Mrs O'Hara's two sons, Kyle, 27, and Dean, 25, and 18-year-old daughter, Morgan, said their faith in policing had been \"shaken to the core\" and blamed police cuts for the lack of training given to officers dealing with domestic abuse cases. Katrina O'Hara's children, Kyle Stark, Morgan O'Hara and Dean Stark have been left devastated by their mother's murder Credit: O'Hara family handout In a statement they said: \"We are deeply upset by the failings identified in both the IOPC report and the Domestic Homicide Review. \"For us, they highlight that our Mother\u2019s death could have been prevented and this only makes our grief even harder to bear. \u201cWe\u2019re victims of police cuts. Every force needs to have the funding to be able to deliver the right training to all officers and support staff, and to then assess how effective that training actually is, otherwise there will be more avoidable deaths. \u201cUnfortunately, our Mother\u2019s case is not unique and our only hope is that her death will serve as a wake-up call to the government and police forces across the country to not brush domestic violence issues under the carpet. As a family we would like to urge anyone going through domestic abuse to speak out and seek help.\" Katrina O'Hara with her daughter Morgan In August 2016, Thomas was jailed for life, with the judge recommending he serve at least 26-years before being considered for parole. As a result of the IOPC investigation a detective constable was given a final written warning and a sergeant received management advice for not following existing procedures. Dorset Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Callaghan said: \u201cWe note the findings of the IOPC report and Domestic Homicide Review.

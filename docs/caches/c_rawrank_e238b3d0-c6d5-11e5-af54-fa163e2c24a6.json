But Ball has been brilliant since returning from a knee injury that sidelined him for 15 games before the NBA All-Star break. In the four games since returning from the knee sprain, Ball is shooting 63.3 percent from long distance and is averaging 12 points, 7.2 assists and 6.7 rebounds per game. He has shot 59.4 percent from downtown in his last nine games.

Beasley admits he's been on a slide since the All-Star break. Taking over for Kristaps Porzingis as starting power forward hasn't been easy. Hornacek, who has only raved about Beasley's prowess this season, singled him out after Friday's defensively dead, 128-105 loss to the Clippers and now may take him out of the starting lineup. After Saturday night's practice at Sacramento, Hornacek said it's \u201cpossible'' he will make a lineup change and Beasley is the strongest candidate.

He came off a fantastic season in Boston, was traded upon the hip injury and only had 15 games to try and get back to form in Cleveland. He was then traded to the Lakers before the trade deadline. The Lakers seem to have their focus on the young core and attracting superstars in the 2018 or 2019 free agency market. There was a rumor going around during Kawhi Leonard's absence that he was unhappy with the Spurs inability to attract superstar talent. Whether that was true or not, who knows but it seems to not be since Kawhi is coming back. I am not insinuating that Isaiah is a superstar pre-injury.

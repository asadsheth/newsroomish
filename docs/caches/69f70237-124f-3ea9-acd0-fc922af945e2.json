The expulsions are in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, U.K., earlier this month, and done in conjunction with up to 16 other Western countries, including Germany, Canada, France, and Ukraine -- the \"largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers ever,\" according to British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Of the 60 Russians in the U.S., 12 are stationed at the Russian mission to the United Nations, where senior administration officials said they were operating under the guise of diplomacy but were deemed to be conducting covert activities.","published_at":1522130790,"content_id":"a09fca37-68b5-3d41-948f-6cbc05558577","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/us-expels-60-russian-intelligence-officers-response-ex-131903902--abc-news-topstories.html","content_published_at":1522110540,"content_time":1522110540,"content_relative_time":16,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

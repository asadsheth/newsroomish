The threat comes just after President Donald Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement, which he deemed flawed because it did not keep Iran from testing ballistic missiles and would eventually expire. Mr Trump also argued that Iran was not in compliance with the basic goal of the deal \u2014 to restrict Iran from enriching weapons grade uranium \u2014 even though the US State Department and the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had both confirmed compliance repeatedly.","published_at":1526902399,"content_id":"d0c953e8-60df-33d9-8089-67114db58eb5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mike-pompeo-threatens-iran-strongest-140500183.html","content_published_at":1526911500,"content_time":1526911500,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null}]

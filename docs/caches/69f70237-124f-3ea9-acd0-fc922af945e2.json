Authorities also identified pharmaceutical magnate Sherman and his wife, Honey, as the two people found dead in a north Toronto mansion Friday. Police call the deaths suspicious, but on Friday also said that there were no signs of forced entry and that they were not looking for any suspect. The Sherman family issued a statement Saturday urging police to conduct a \"thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation\" into the deaths and calling on the media to avoid speculating on the cause of the deaths. Canadian Business magazine recently estimated his worth at 4.77 billion Canadian dollars ($3.65 billion), making him the 15th richest person in the country. But the Shermans didn\u2019t flaunt their wealth. He drove beat-up cars. They recently put up their house for sale for 6.9 million Canadian dollars ($5.4 million), but the home is relatively modest for a billionaire. Flowers from mourners are seen outside the home of billionaire founder of Canadian pharmaceutical firm Apotex Inc., Barry Sherman and his wife Honey Credit: Chris Helgren\/Reuters Sherman founded Toronto-based Apotex Inc. in 1974 with two employees and turned the generic drugmaker into a company that now has 11,000 employees worldwide. The company released a statement Saturday paying tribute to its founder, praising both his philanthropic efforts and what it described as his vision for health care. The Shermans were among Canada\u2019s most generous philanthropists, and their deaths shocked Canadian high society and the country\u2019s Jewish community. The couple made numerous multimillion-dollar donations to hospitals, schools and charities and had buildings named in their honor. They hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Liberal Party fundraiser in 2015. Honey Sherman was sat on the boards of several civic groups, including Mount Sinai\u2019s Women\u2019s Auxiliary, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the International American Joint Distribution Committee. Linda Frum, a Canadian senator and close friend of the couple, said they were one of the kindest and most beloved members of Canada\u2019s Jewish community. \"Our community is steeped in grief. I am heartbroken,\" Frum tweeted Barry Sherman was not without controversy. He faced legal action from family members alleging they had been cut out of the company over the years. A judge dismissed the claim. \u00a0","published_at":1513589495,"content_id":"35d9a35c-6e00-3278-82c0-49f527ac6dbc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/toronto-detectives-billionaire-barry-sherman-045458348.html","content_published_at":1513572898,"content_time":1513572898,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-27c726d6-eace-3784-9b19-e3b7152530ed_a-0482ea97-8267-3008-b520-5739597bd157","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/apnewsbreak-us-soldier-ambushed-niger-wasnt-captured-180502267--politics-2rq8ajb","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/apnewsbreak-us-soldier-ambushed-niger-wasnt-captured-180502267--politics.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.tq8nP5SfhBdlSLa.RutHQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/bfdbeb3e38134a9e8287392429182170_original.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/GbZvDMIjs3RF110kOOpFug--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MDM2O3c9MjQ4ODs-\/http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/bfdbeb3e38134a9e8287392429182170_original.jpg","height":4036,"width":2488,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/bfdbeb3e38134a9e8287392429182170_original.jpg","imgw":2488,"imgh":4036,"title":"APNewsBreak: US soldier fought to end after ambush in Niger","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Army Sgt.

Under the plan unveiled after the two parties were sworn in yesterday, Austria will seek to stop illegal immigration and ensure that people whose asylum claims are rejected are quickly deported. Asylum is \"temporary protection\" only, the policy states. The money seized by authorities will apparently be used to cover basic care costs, while mobile phone data will be trawled through to clarify identities, the coalition said. Austria\u2019s far-Right Freedom Party secured its return to power yesterday (MON), as the president swore in the country\u2019s new government amid protests on the streets of Vienna. Sebastian Kurz, of the conservative People's Party (OVP), is now the new Austrian chancellor, after he reached a deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), which was founded by former members of the Nazi party, on Friday. Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the nationalist FPO will be the new vice chancellor. Austria is now the only western European country with a far-right party in government. And at just 31, Kurz is the youngest leader in Europe, after his party won the October 15th election with 32 percent of the vote. The nationalist FPO came third with 26 percent of the vote. \u00a0 Mr Kurz won the election with a hard line on immigration that overlapped with the FPO. The future leaders presented their approximately 180-page government programme on Sunday, and said that they planned to do things \u201cmuch better\u201d and that \u201cnobody had anything to fear\u201d. New Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is flanked by Austrian President Alexander Van Der Bellen, right, and new Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, left Credit: \u00a0Ronald Zak\/\u00a0AP Mr Strache said on Facebook on Sunday that the new government will also slash benefits for asylum seekers. \"It will no longer happen for migrants who have never worked here a single day or paid anything into the social system to get thousands of Euros in welfare,\" he wrote. Austria should be a land of diversity, Mr Kurz also said \u2013 but pointed out that it should also have basic values that apply to all. The coalition\u2019s motto is \"time for the new\", as they promise to establish a new political style in the country. \u00a0 In a speech to swear in the new chancellor, President Van der Bellen urged the coalition to adopt a responsible policy, especially towards minorities. \"Working with the weakest shows what our values \u200b\u200bare really worth,\" he said. \u00a0 Around 6,000 people packed out Heroes Square in the centre of Vienna to protest, according to police, waving placards that said \u201crefugees welcome\u201d and \u201cno Nazi pigs\u201d. There was also a heavy police presence, including helicopters and water cannon. Austria election results 2017 On Tuesday Mr Kurz will travel to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Donald Tusk, the president of the European Commission, amid widespread concern that Austria\u2019s swing to the right will further exacerbate EU divisions. Mr Kurz has already ruled out a referendum on membership of the European Union and stressed that the new government should be pro-EU, but last week he said he would follow countries such as Hungary and Poland in rejecting the bloc\u2019s mandatory migrant relocation quotas.\u00a0 Mr Kurz has also emphasised that he wants to work in close cooperation with Germany. \u201cWe are very connected with Germany - human, economic, political and cultural,\u201d he told Bild newspaper. \u201cI look forward to further cooperation with the German federal government, in particular with Chancellor Angela Merkel,\u201d he said. But there has been mixed reaction in Germany. Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Angela Merkel, said \"we are ready for a close and trusting cooperation.\" But that it \u201cgoes without saying\u201d that this should always happen on the \"basis of the values \u200b\u200bthat we have given for Europe\".\u00a0 While the Social Democrats (SPD), with whom Mrs Merkel is hoping to form a new government, have reacted with horror. \"Austria-Hungary is back. With Chancellor Kurz, fraternity member Strache and arsonist Orb\u00e1n, it's three quarters to the right,\u201d said Achim Post, SPD politician.","published_at":1513591288,"content_id":"56aafdc5-6bf5-3f23-9d6e-ab7d53ea60ff","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/austrian-far-sworn-government-amid-132007713.html","content_published_at":1513618160,"content_time":1513618160,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-bef43cff-e397-3431-aed7-a77d7b093d15_a-443d2c22-f9bf-38c1-a91a-5cb0baa5be64","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/passenger-train-derails-bridge-onto-609hgpy","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/passenger-train-derails-bridge-onto-163337356.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nJ6EAezRqReeS57wDlzlwQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/c86db98564580b2358ea9efe4c863533","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/su5RTcllY7iN0yZ.V2j3_w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03NTA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/c86db98564580b2358ea9efe4c863533","height":750,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/c86db98564580b2358ea9efe4c863533","imgw":1200,"imgh":750,"title":"Passenger train derails from bridge and hits motorway on first high speed run causing 'massive' casualties","summary":"Passenger train derails from bridge and hits motorway on first high speed run causing 'massive' casualties","published_at":1513618833,"content_id":"443d2c22-f9bf-38c1-a91a-5cb0baa5be64","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/passenger-train-derails-bridge-onto-163337356.html","content_published_at":1513625916,"content_time":1513625916,"content_relative_time":0,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-d21a6137-4f7c-39c3-a42f-328fdd681008_a-e366471a-0fa9-3d56-bfba-af41b7483060","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/macron-sees-february-end-fight-against-islamic-state-4em1yww","author":"third_watch","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/macron-sees-february-end-fight-against-islamic-state-214806465.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Macron sees February end to fight against Islamic State in Syria","summary":"The military campaign against Islamic State in Syria should be completed in February following the end of fighting against the militant group in Iraq, French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"On December 9, Iraqi Prime Minister (Haider al-) Abadi announced the end of the war and the victory over Daesh, and I think that by mid- to late February we will have won the war in Syria,\" Macron said in a broadcast interview, using the Arab acronym for Islamic State.

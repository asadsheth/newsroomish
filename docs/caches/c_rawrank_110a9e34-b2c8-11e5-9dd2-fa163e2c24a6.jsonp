Brown, 28, returned from a torn ACL injury in 2016 to catch 31 passes for 477 yards and four touchdowns for the Arizona Cardinals in 2017 -- all career highs. The NFL Network was first to report the agreement. The Seahawks reinforced a position of some need following Paul Richardson's departure in free agency. Brown, who is listed at 6-foot-2, 205 pounds and is considered to have good speed at that size, could push 2017 third-round pick Amara Darboh for the No. 3 role behind Doug Baldwin and Tyler Lockett.

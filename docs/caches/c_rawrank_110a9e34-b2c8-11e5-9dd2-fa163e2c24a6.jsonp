Beyond the narrative the director created on a history of tension between the two Type A personalities, he\u2014perhaps unintentionally\u2014shined a light on how absolutely evil Bill Belichick\u2019s defenses can be in the postseason right in time for the Super Bowl.I thought about this during Eagles media availability later in the afternoon when quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo was talking about how someone figures out which of the Patriots\u2019 multiple defenses will be the flavor of the day when there\u2019s only one game left. When a team has so much history and institutional memory to call back on, especially with a history of changing schemes week to week, how far back would a coach potentially go in order to build a complete dossier on an opponent?\u201cI don\u2019t want them to know how far we\u2019ve gone back,\u201d DeFilippo said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve done extensive, extensive film study on what they\u2019ve done.\u201dContrast that with the job Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia has this weekend. Eagles head coach Doug Pederson has been in his current position for just two seasons. He was the playcaller for one year in Kansas City and dramatically shifted his offense after quarterback Carson Wentz went down with a torn ACL in December. While it\u2019s never an easy task to stop any NFL offense, especially one that has been surprisingly effective in the postseason, won\u2019t the Patriots defense have a narrower scope of possibilities to hone in on?\u201cFrom the coordinator standpoint I\u2019m always kind of looking at, \u2018O.K., what did this guy do against us the last time,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cHow much of it is going to be similar. Is it the same team or a different team? You might have different skill position players on the current team than you did the previous time. Some of it might be relevant, some might not be, but you try and do your due diligence on everything.\u201dSo, is the Wentz tape even relevant?\u201cIt is,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cI mean, honestly, I don\u2019t think they missed a beat. There are some parts of it that, maybe, were altered based on the quarterback position and some of the reads they had but what they have offensively is the same.\u201dIs Patricia just paying the Eagles lip service? We\u2019ll find out in just a few days. In that time, though, it would seem one set of coaches has a wider information gap to close. Not getting this newsletter in your inbox yet?

Cousins, who played the past two seasons under the franchise tag \u2014 the first quarterback to be saddled with consecutive tags \u2014 would've cost Washington more than $34 million to franchise a third time.

Both are big and seem to have good hands. From what I can gather, the tight ends that usually go in the Top 20 are really just oversized receivers. I don't know if those two guys are in that category \u2013 probably more second-round options. All that being said, I think the Cowboys should consider a tight end in the early rounds, but I'm not sure one fits the 19th\u00a0spot this

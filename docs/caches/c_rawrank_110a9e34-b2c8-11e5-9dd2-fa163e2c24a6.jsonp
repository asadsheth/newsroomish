The deal, per Rapoport, can be worth as much as $2 million with incentives. Shepard, who was released by the Carolina Panthers last week, had 17 receptions for 202 yards and one touchdown in 15 games last season after signing a three-year, $10 million deal. He had 47 catches for 634 yards and four scores in 72 career contests with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Panthers.

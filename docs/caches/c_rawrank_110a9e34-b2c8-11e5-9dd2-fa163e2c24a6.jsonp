Since having a franchise signal-caller makes it easier for a team to be competitive, and because almost all franchise quarterbacks are found in the draft, we'll be talking a lot about quarterbacks. While they gave Sam Bradford a one-year, $20 million deal this offseason, the Arizona Cardinals find themselves without a franchise QB. The Cardinals may be able to win with Bradford, but his injury history and age (30) mean he's far from a long-term lock. Could the Cardinals find their long-term answer in this year's draft? It won't be easy as Arizona doesn't pick until 15th overall.

facing decision on Jeff Janis' special-teams value","summary":"Several hours before the NFL's roster submission deadline last September, the New England Patriots made a move to acquire defensive back Johnson Bademosi from the Detroit Lions in exchange for a sixth-round pick in 2019. Officially listed as a cornerback, Bademosi knew coach Bill Belichick coveted the former Stanford Cardinal for his special-teams ability rather than his modest coverage skills. By season's end, Bademosi would have played more snaps on special teams (280) than he did from scrimmage (215) and led the Patriots in special teams tackles with nine.

rejects Burfict's appeal, upholds 4-game suspension","summary":"CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict will be sidelined to start a season for the fourth year in a row, this time serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancers. The NFL rejected Burfict's appeal without comment and upheld the full suspension on Thursday. It's the third time the volatile linebacker has been suspended by the league in the past three years. The Bengals are accustomed to going without their most valuable defensive player, whom they've steadfastly supported throughout his suspension-shortened career. They even gave him a three-year contract extension last season while he was serving a three-game suspension from the league.

That doesn't mean they're going to overlook keeping one of their own. The club wants Joe Looney to return and could sign the veteran backup as early as Monday, a source said. The Cowboys are also close to finalizing deals with Cameron Fleming and Marcus Martin. The goal is to have all three contracts completed by Monday. Looney didn't start a game for the Cowboys last season but he's a veteran presence in the offensive line who can step in at all three interior line positions. He's part of the team's Jumbo Package when it replaces a tight end with an extra lineman.

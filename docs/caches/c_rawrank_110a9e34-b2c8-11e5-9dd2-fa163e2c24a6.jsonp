Harbaugh led Baltimore to the playoffs in each of his first five seasons, but the Ravens have failed to make the postseason in four of the last five. That includes a three-year drought. The Ravens will look to end that against a schedule that features the NFC South and AFC West. The home schedule is friendly, but the road map is especially brutal in 2018. Below is a breakdown of the Ravens' schedule in 2018. Baltimore's regular-season schedule, including dates and kickoff times, will be posted after it is made available by the NFL.

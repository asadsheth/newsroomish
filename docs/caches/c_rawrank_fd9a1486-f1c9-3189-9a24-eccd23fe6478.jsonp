But Chris Hecker's\u00a0SpyParty\u00a0is unique. With the tiniest of teams, Hecker designed and made his dream game about subtle human behavior, where a sniper tries to identify a spy at a cocktail party and shoot the spy with a single bullet. The game launched on Thursday on Steam Early Access with all new art, 21 new animated characters, 10 art venues, and eight missions with a lot of variations. I played it with GamesBeat's Stephanie Chan yesterday and we took turns playing the spy, who plays a game of deception, and the sniper, who has to tap the power of perception. I think it's pretty good.

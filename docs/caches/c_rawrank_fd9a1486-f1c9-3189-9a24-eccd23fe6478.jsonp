But there's a major catch consumers need to know about. The game will be streamed via the cloud, similar to services like PlayStation Now and GeForce Now. That severely limits the Switch's portability, and it also raises questions over digital ownership. In order to stream the title, users will need a solid internet connection, which means playing on an airplane will be next to impossible. To that end, the need of a internet connection will limit when and where Switch owners can play the title.

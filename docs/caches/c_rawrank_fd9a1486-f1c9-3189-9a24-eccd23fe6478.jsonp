Usually, the hacker group called CPY is the one who comes with cracks for games using Denuvo DRM, however, in the case of Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition, Chinese crack group, 3DM, is the one to crack it. Furthermore, the game being cracked might have nothing to do with the Denuvo at all, as the group itself noted that they used the \u201c.exe\u201d file from the game's recently released playable demo on Steam and unlocked the full Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition from the unencrypted pre-load files downloaded through Origin.

Most of us are familiar with Jin, Paul, Lee and all the other characters from the franchise. So, it is exciting to be finally able to play Tekken on the mobile. Tekken is a 1v1 fighting game that can be played with only taps and swipes. The controls are easy and intuitive but call for a decent amount of skill. That is a refreshing change from purely number-based fighting games. There is also the fresh concept of move cards that are unique for every character. Before starting a match, you can choose nine move cards to take","published_at":1520208250,"content_id":"56be8bc5-250b-3658-9f20-c1aa81a10acc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.telegraphindia.com\/technology\/tekken-comes-to-mobile-213100?ref=hm-new-stry","content_published_at":1520204400,"content_time":1520204400,"content_relative_time":69,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":69,"comment_relative_time":69,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c1034baa-f2ec-38fa-a14c-dbf4ee6884d9_a-ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c1034baa-f2ec-38fa-a14c-dbf4ee6884d9_a-ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/secret-tier-100-challenge-reward-3rdini6","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidthier\/2018\/03\/04\/high-octane-glider-how-to-get-the-secret-tier-100-challenge-reward-in-fortnite-battle-royale\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fwN9BwYNHHbb7qbLlbzdCQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STcPX9yCpAyMqhhIgnFo6w--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b--862056353.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/SkPjPTCCSjT.VvSzRlAh6g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STcPX9yCpAyMqhhIgnFo6w--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b--862056353.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/STcPX9yCpAyMqhhIgnFo6w--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b--862056353.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"How To Get The Secret, Tier 100 Challenge Reward In 'Fortnite: Battle Royale'","summary":"Fortnite: Battle Royale's Battle Pass has a sort of ingenious solution to that problem: for $10, the game offers 100 successive carrots on 100 successive sticks, giving you tiny goals to work for every day as you grind your way to new skins, harvesting tools, gliders and all other sorts of loot that you can use to customize your in-game appearance. As Paul Tassi says, the Battle Pass is a smart compromise between the realities of free-to-play economics and the exploitative nature of loot boxes: it works like a sort of optional subscription system that people who play the game religiously are more than happy to participate in. The Battle Pass itself is no joke: two weeks in and I'm at Tier 24 having done a fair number of challenges and put in a good amount of time, even if all of that time was without a victory or a sniper kill (I hate snipers). The theoretical apex reward in the battle pass is a skin that transforms your character into John Wick, someone that looks exactly like John Wick, and it's a great piece of loot to quest after.","published_at":1520197874,"content_id":"ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidthier\/2018\/03\/04\/high-octane-glider-how-to-get-the-secret-tier-100-challenge-reward-in-fortnite-battle-royale\/","content_published_at":1520139600,"content_time":1520139600,"content_relative_time":87,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":87,"comment_relative_time":87,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"3997e4bc-820b-38e4-b267-98c9765d6764","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-57d879e9-f507-34c3-b95e-ac17f2587bdf_a-3997e4bc-820b-38e4-b267-98c9765d6764","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-57d879e9-f507-34c3-b95e-ac17f2587bdf_a-3997e4bc-820b-38e4-b267-98c9765d6764","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/spyro-dragon-twitter-page-being-3s7kdk1","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"SegmentNext","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/03\/396147\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"New Spyro The Dragon Twitter Page Is Being Created, Could Hint At Remastered Games","summary":"Two weeks ago a rumor started going around that the original Spyro the Dragon trilogy would be getting a remastering similar to those given to Jak and Daxter and the Crash Bandicoot games. While there wasn't any concrete proof of this before, a Spyro the Dragon Twitter page has apparently been made. Activision has previously indicated that more remasters of older games are on their way, and with Spyro having not gotten a game in years (barring the character making his way into the Skylanders games), the time might be ripe for a new Spyro game, or at least some acknowledgement that the series still exists. A ResetEra user is responsible for pointing out the new Spyro the Dragon Twitter page, and with it being set up there's a big possibility that something is getting ready to be announced via that page, or on YouTube.","published_at":1520196625,"content_id":"3997e4bc-820b-38e4-b267-98c9765d6764","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/03\/396147\/","content_published_at":1520028896,"content_time":1520028896,"content_relative_time":118,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":118,"comment_relative_time":118,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"76d233eb-e2a8-35e8-bc1a-76b6bf8d83b8","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-20bf05d5-258c-3b5e-a22e-53107ac5bb85_a-76d233eb-e2a8-35e8-bc1a-76b6bf8d83b8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-20bf05d5-258c-3b5e-a22e-53107ac5bb85_a-76d233eb-e2a8-35e8-bc1a-76b6bf8d83b8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/airdrop-%E2%80%93-airdrops-bounty-crypto-28g9r24","author":"nanook","provider":"Medium","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/medium.com\/airdrops-and-bounty-crypto\/new-airdrop-719f4fd40a19","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"NEW AIRDROP \u2013 Airdrops_and_Bounty_Crypto","summary":"NEW AIRDROP #Odyssey round 2 started!

It's an example of what can be done if the industry is true to the nature of the market. But it's too early to tell if Black Panther will change business practices or it's an outlier.

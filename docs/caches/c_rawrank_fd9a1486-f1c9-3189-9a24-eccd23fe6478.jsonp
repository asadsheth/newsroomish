First was the Razer Blade Stealth ($1,449.99 at Amazon.com), an ultrathin laptop to compete with the MacBooks ($1,239.00 at Amazon.com) of the world. Now there's the Razer Cynosa Chroma. The Cynosa is technically a\u00a0gaming\u00a0keyboard, but its three best features have little to do with gaming: Spill resistance, how it looks and what it costs.\u00a0 The Cynosa retails for $59 in the US, AU$99 in Australia and \u00a364 in the UK, making it the cheapest Razer keyboard. There's also a Pro version, which lets you add lighting effects under the keyboard itself, for $79, AU$139 and \u00a379.\u00a0","published_at":1513518315,"content_id":"40b96c32-9b15-3c9e-a029-425b90155544","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/products\/razer-cynosa-chroma\/preview\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a3674e24b738500072114e2&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","content_published_at":1513512022,"content_time":1513512022,"content_relative_time":33,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":33,"comment_relative_time":33,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b05b8765-d001-3771-b4ad-7a4dc9f8515f_a-c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b05b8765-d001-3771-b4ad-7a4dc9f8515f_a-c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/greatest-video-games-2017-46hr3xo","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"CNET","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/pictures\/here-are-the-greatest-video-games-of-2017\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a366dd93ed3f00007c65ef6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KXtws0UNGJqOadXSm4bDMA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H1xzpTFBYY3brLYw5hPs5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6--1271472524.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YAbZgP6loGDOglsIFW7N_A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H1xzpTFBYY3brLYw5hPs5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6--1271472524.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H1xzpTFBYY3brLYw5hPs5A--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6--1271472524.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Here are the greatest video games of 2017","summary":"CNET tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol.","published_at":1513516518,"content_id":"c040d66b-30b0-3f8e-afe4-d388341195d6","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/pictures\/here-are-the-greatest-video-games-of-2017\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5a366dd93ed3f00007c65ef6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter","content_published_at":1513512000,"content_time":1513512000,"content_relative_time":33,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":33,"comment_relative_time":33,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a0e032a4-24a9-3933-88fe-e9568c86c6ad","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-91043cf5-770a-39d7-bc86-b47532fc77c9_a-a0e032a4-24a9-3933-88fe-e9568c86c6ad","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-91043cf5-770a-39d7-bc86-b47532fc77c9_a-a0e032a4-24a9-3933-88fe-e9568c86c6ad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/most-talked-video-games-play-2mh2swf","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Popular Mechanics","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/culture\/gaming\/g14444347\/new-video-game-releases\/?src=socialflowTW","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"The Most Talked-About Video Games to Play This Year","summary":"We've praised Destiny in the past because it's a game that offers something for everyone thanks to its massive open world, story-based campaigns, co-op mode, and, of course, online play.

In any case, now that we've seen November's numbers, we can safely say that\u00a0Call of Duty: WWII\u00a0is the best-selling game not only of the month but of the entire year.

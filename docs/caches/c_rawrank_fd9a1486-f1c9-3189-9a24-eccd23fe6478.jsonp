As usual, many video game developers have also been playing fantastic practical jokes on their players. Usually when it comes to video games, 'Easter Eggs' are little hidden secrets that developers have left in the game for players to find. Some of these pranks are anything but hidden, but they're undoubtedly hilarious and fun to find. While some jokes are purely just news releases, some are actually new features that have been put into games.

Just what his sequel will be about remains a mystery for now, but there's clearly much about the OASIS \u2013 a virtual world in where people can live out their every fantasy as long as they have the coin to pay for it \u2013 that can be explored in not only a sequel film, but potentially an entire franchise. Early tracking reports put Ready Player One as having an opening weekend in the $38-$42 million range; a respectable haul, but perhaps a bit less than is expected for a film with little-to-no competition that's opening across a holiday weekend. Plus, there's no denying the box office appeal of Steven Spielberg and his involvement alone is sure bring in some viewers who would otherwise skip Ready Player One.","published_at":1522509418,"content_id":"7df75669-84af-3ff8-a0a3-f537db9296e7","content_url":"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/ready-player-one-movie-sequel-details-book\/","content_published_at":1522421771,"content_time":1522421771,"content_relative_time":77,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":77,"comment_relative_time":77,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

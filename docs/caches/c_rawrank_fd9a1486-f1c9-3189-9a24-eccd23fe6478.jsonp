It is an incredibly simple thing to think back on but, at the time, the frisson of excitement for a six-year-old conjuring such a thing from a few lines of code was pure magic. So it\u2019s a nice touch on this miniature homage that you can fire up BASIC, blue screen and all, to recreate some of those memories. There are a million better ways to learn coding these days, of course, but I couldn\u2019t resist making that 8-bit balloon fly again to get the nostalgia glands tingling. And that is what the makers of the C64 Mini are betting on. Made by Retro Games Ltd\u00a0after a successful Kickstarter, the C64 Mini is looking to follow in the memory-jogging footsteps of Nintendo\u2019s NES and SNES Minis. As such, you get a miniature facsimile of the machine and a selection of retro games to play on it. The mini is based on the original beige \"breadbin\"\u00a0model of the Commodore 64 (rather than the updated grey 64C I had) and is a lovely little thing. The keyboard is just for show, and is missing the markings on the underside of the keys, but it's sturdy and convincing with the red power light in the right place and two modern USB slots standing in for the side-mounted serial ports. If you are in the market for this wave of retro consoles for the physical model, the C64 Mini can mix it with the best. Which is, unfortunately, perhaps more than can be said for the rest of the package. The C64 Mini comes with a recreation of a C64 joystick and, while that has the same nostalgia tingle in look, it is clunky and unresponsive. There is a chance that this is by design rather than fault, Retro Games Ltd. looking to recreate the awkward joystick wrestling that came with games past. However, even if this is the case, it somewhat misses the point of these updates. A good nostalgia product knows where to chamfer the edges to reinforce rose-tinted memories, refining frustrations you used to put up with but chose to forget. The C64 Mini is only partly successful at this, with the joystick perhaps being the most obvious foible. Loading the 64 games that come loaded onto the machine, however, is a far easier experience. The menu screen is a simple carousel that lets you flip through each title, with a small blurb on each and information on its designer. Often you find yourself reminded that in this earliest time of video game development, the vast majority of games were crafted by just a handful of people. As ever with the selection of games, your own mileage will vary. To be brutally honest, unlike much of Nintendo\u2019s oeuvre on their Mini consoles, there are very few C64 games that truly stand up today in terms of playability. But for retro nerds, there is a reasonable amount to get your teeth into, from shoot \u2018em ups to adventure games to sports. C64 Mini | Pre-installed games If the games don\u2019t necessarily play brilliantly these days (and good luck convincing any younger members of the household otherwise), there is still a nice historical curiousity to many of the titles. I got a kick out of revisiting the halls of Skool Daze, for instance, navigating the school day in one of the earliest examples of the freeform \u2018sandbox\u2019 game. Platformer Impossible Mission, which has you leaping around a super-criminal\u2019s underground base, has a labyrinthine 2D map that has since inspired recent games such as Spelunky and Flinthook. I also have a soft spot for the boisterous futuristic Speedball and Epyx\u2019s collection of more familiar sporting events; from the Summer and Winter Olympics, to the quirkier World and California Games that includes caber throwing and playing hackysack respectively. These are all incredibly simplistic in control terms, of course, but in some ways its fascinating to see how much mileage the developers of the time wrung out of the machine and its control input limitations. The joystick is a little over clunky Credit: Retro Computers Although in part due to this, many of the games on show here are rock-hard to master. You can forget tutorials on how to perform a triple-axel in the figure skating or just how to make Monty go On the Run. Back then, games would come with detailed manuals on how to play and would expect you to swot up before you played. The C64 Mini doesn\u2019t make any concessions to this either. There are no manuals with the software, meaning you will need to go hunting for PDFs online to have any chance with a lot of the titles. In many ways, calling up instructions on your phone or nearby laptop is easy than scrolling through on screen, but it does seem a shame that a system sold as a retro remembrance doesn\u2019t have a little more documentation in the package itself. The game selection is certainly missing some more seminal C64 work too. This is completely understandable giving the licensing minefield that must exist in running games from the now defunct LucasArts and the like. But if you were hoping to dive into a Zac McKraken adventure or fight in International Karate + (one of my personal favourites), you will have to find another way. But the C64 Mini provides exactly that, even if it is more complicated than we would like right now. You can load C64 programmes onto the Mini by downloading them from external sources (with the copyright caveats that entails) onto a USB stick and firing them up by typing simple access codes into BASIC. The basic instructed way, found on the C64 Mini\u2019s website, can be a little laborious however. An apparent oversight means that you must have the joystick plugged in at all times, otherwise the Mini will kick you out of BASIC and back to the carousel. What that means is that, with the basic kit, you wont beable to plug in the USB stick and replace the joystick with a keyboard. Instead you will need to use the virtual keyboard, inputting characters one by one using the joystick. And this way also only allows one game to be loaded at a time. Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA However, there are some workarounds. Plenty of intrepid souls have figured out how to load multiple games at once with a few tweaks. And you can use a USB splitter to connect keyboard, joystick and memory stick all at the same time. There are definite drawbacks for the casual player to some of the quirks to the C64 Mini and Retro Games has said they are working on a more streamlined way to load C64 files. For an enthusiast, figuring out homebrew methods will be part of the fun and is a large reason something like BASIC is included at all. This perhaps sums up the C64 Mini\u2019s appeal. Perhaps unlike Nintendo\u2019s more accessible Minis, the C64 is unlike to convert any new fans or gamers with more modern sensibilities to its church. For the retro-inclined, however, it could be just what they are looking for.","published_at":1526640625,"content_id":"3d448e58-50dd-3503-b55e-ada235a8f707","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/c64-mini-review-nostalgia-drenched-104541214.html","content_published_at":1526640341,"content_time":1526640341,"content_relative_time":8,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":8,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ec8fb24b-dd91-34b4-a8a2-4161d5135a1d","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-a56e95bc-079c-34ae-97ce-5eabb88f2234_a-ec8fb24b-dd91-34b4-a8a2-4161d5135a1d","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-a56e95bc-079c-34ae-97ce-5eabb88f2234_a-ec8fb24b-dd91-34b4-a8a2-4161d5135a1d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/3-reasons-why-leaked-e3-wtkcxte","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jasonevangelho\/2018\/05\/18\/3-reasons-why-that-leaked-e3-nintendo-direct-schedule-is-hilariously-fake\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nzaDVTrNMWdSH5WGfIv8hw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/36terhhsu8MsF.ZHz5M9lA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ec8fb24b-dd91-34b4-a8a2-4161d5135a1d-535493827.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/codc0wmxvbRnaiGqQwQYwg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/36terhhsu8MsF.ZHz5M9lA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ec8fb24b-dd91-34b4-a8a2-4161d5135a1d-535493827.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/36terhhsu8MsF.ZHz5M9lA--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ec8fb24b-dd91-34b4-a8a2-4161d5135a1d-535493827.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"3 Reasons Why That Leaked E3 Nintendo Direct Schedule Is Hilariously Fake","summary":"Are you somewhat proficient with word processing software?

Back in 2013, a survival-horror management sim called State of Decay took Xbox 360 owners by surprise. Despite being one of the final titles published by Microsoft Studios for the last-gen console, the open world zombie game sold well and received praise from critics and consumers alike. So it was no surprise when Microsoft revealed a sequel for the Xbox One at E3 2016. Unfortunately, that sequel fails to recapture the magic of the original. State of Decay 2 starts promisingly enough. When you first load up the game, you will choose one of several pairs of survivors with which to embark upon your post-apocalyptic expedition. Each of the pairs have interesting back stories and dynamics (at least, that's what the flavor text that accompanies them would lead you to believe), and once you've made a choice, you're immediately thrown into a linear tutorial where you'll learn the controls and mechanics. Unfortunately, once you've completed the tutorial and are let loose into the game's sizable open world, you'll quickly realize that State of Decay 2 doesn't have much else to offer. Beyond building up your base and claiming outposts out in the world (which can be satisfying in spurts), you will spend a vast majority of your time holding down one button to scour through a box or a cabinet or a closet which will contain items that you then have to lug back to your base. You can speed up the process by holding down another button, but there's a chance you'll make a loud noise and alert zombies. At which point you have to fight zombies, which is utterly tedious and requires no skill. Within an hour, I had already become concerned that State of Decay 2 was never going to grab me. A few hours later, my suspicions were confirmed. Combat is serviceable, but lacks variety and intensity. Building a base and recruiting allies can be rewarding, but even as someone who loves checking off boxes games, I found the endless loop of running out into the world to find supplies and lugging them back to base exhausting. And while the world is far bigger than the world of State of Decay 1, the story has been removed altogether in favor of dynamic storytelling, which simply doesn't work here, at least not for me. There was no driving force behind any of my actions, and it didn't mean anything when one of my allies succumbed to the zombie plague. Then there are the bugs. Developer Undead Labs is a relatively small independent developer, and State of Decay 2 is priced appropriately at $29.99, but the sheer number of bugs is astounding. My AI partners would regularly get stuck in door frames, the game is prone to freezing, and it's so easy to get lodged in the world's geometry that there's actually a button in the menu to reset your character's position and dislodge yourself. This is not an exhaustive review, nor is it meant to be. I haven't completed the game, and there's no doubt in my mind that I will continue to unlock more systems and discover more interesting locales as I progress, but after enjoying my time with the first game, I'm incredibly disappointed in what the sequel has shown me so far. State of Decay 2 will be available for Xbox One and Windows PC on May 22nd.","published_at":1526571032,"content_id":"f51bc4a6-94bb-3df4-8845-8a29ee1fda60","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/state-decay-2-shambling-repetitive-mess-152446820.html","content_published_at":1526570686,"content_time":1526570686,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"b8fbc7e0-a261-345a-88c0-0b2461acde9e","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-76ce8904-bd6a-30b1-babc-3fc3d7deec81_a-b8fbc7e0-a261-345a-88c0-0b2461acde9e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-76ce8904-bd6a-30b1-babc-3fc3d7deec81_a-b8fbc7e0-a261-345a-88c0-0b2461acde9e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/watch-todays-call-duty-black-18qw1do","author":"third_watch","provider":"Digital Trends","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/gaming\/watch-call-of-duty-black-ops-4-reveal-stream-here\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ywYBDwf7MqpgWEXIp226qQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/W4g8wQPBo2UPYF_oWAD46Q--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b8fbc7e0-a261-345a-88c0-0b2461acde9e--1385925463.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D295rUSckghZFqJXF6ZmzQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/W4g8wQPBo2UPYF_oWAD46Q--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b8fbc7e0-a261-345a-88c0-0b2461acde9e--1385925463.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/W4g8wQPBo2UPYF_oWAD46Q--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b8fbc7e0-a261-345a-88c0-0b2461acde9e--1385925463.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Watch today's 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 4' reveal event here","summary":"Activision and Treyarch will finally show off Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 to the world on Thursday, May 17, and you can watch it all right here.

The original game was released back in 2006 on the PS2 and was both a visually striking game, for its use of traditional Japanese sumi-e and ukiyo-e art styles, as well as its unique gameplay based around drawing gestures on the screen. This inevitably resulted in a Wii port in 2008 with motion controls, which is something this Switch version will partly retain in terms of its Joy-Con input.","published_at":1526556874,"content_id":"0979994e-9ed3-3309-9a39-174b604b7ac2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/olliebarder\/2018\/05\/17\/okami-hd-is-released-on-the-switch-this-august\/","content_published_at":1526533200,"content_time":1526533200,"content_relative_time":38,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":38,"comment_relative_time":38,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"a33fdfdb-5eb9-396f-ab35-d96efa413304","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-9fde3002-2d19-3ffe-974d-1085233701ad_a-a33fdfdb-5eb9-396f-ab35-d96efa413304","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-9fde3002-2d19-3ffe-974d-1085233701ad_a-a33fdfdb-5eb9-396f-ab35-d96efa413304","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/british-gaming-firm-enlists-army-2s4sgk7","author":"nanook","provider":"Reuters","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/21\/reuters-85x27_113626.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/british-gaming-firm-enlists-army-101218869.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"British gaming firm enlists army of players to create Worlds Adrift","summary":"British game maker Bossa Studios will release Worlds Adrift on Thursday, an ambitious adventure game designed to appeal to the Minecraft generation that has taken three years and 50,000 gamers to create.

Developed by Ivory Tower and Ubisoft Reflections, the racing game pushed the limits of the open world by allowing players to drive from coast to coast through a scaled-down recreation of the US. Dozens of cities and landmarks were present, giving players the feeling of a cross-country road trip as they tackled objectives in an extensive story-driven campaign. But in spite of its ambition, the failure of the The Crew was oddly simple: It just wasn\u2019t fun to play. On top of a variety of technical issues, the AI was prone to vicious rubber-banding, the vehicles themselves felt floaty and unresponsive, and players had to be online to play the game at all, no matter what they were doing in-game. So nearly four years later, you can understand why I was cautiously optimistic when walking into a demo session for The Crew 2. Given the amount of time that Ivory Tower (the sole developer of the sequel) has had to not only address the first game\u2019s issues, but become more familiar with development for the PS4 and Xbox One, it seemed inevitable that the follow-up would be a significant step up over the janky original. And in many ways, it is. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0LyIEgUA5Qg The two most substantial changes from The Crew to The Crew 2 will be evident within moments of starting. First off, the story of the first game's campaign has been stripped for parts, leaving a bare-bones plot in its place that basically serves to get you from point A to point B. Rather than stepping into the shoes of a character with a backstory and personality, you will create your own character to take on the game's myriad missions in any order you choose on your way to becoming a champion. It's more in the style of Forza Horizon than Need for Speed. When you first step into the world of The Crew 2 (which takes place on a similar truncated map of the US as the original game, albeit with some major alterations and additions), you'll be given the opportunity to join four different motorsports families: Freestyle, Street Racing, Pro Racing and Off Road. Each of the families offer unique types of missions and races, and the more fame you acquire, you more missions you'll unlock across the map. Speaking with a member of the Ivory Tower development team, I learned that one of the most frequent requests from players of The Crew was to be given the freedom to make their own stories. Apparently, the linearity of the first game turned enough fans off that Ivory Tower decided it would be best to follow in the footsteps of its peers and let players loose on the massive virtual landmass it built, rather than craft another guided experience. Having only spent a few hours with The Crew 2, it's far too early for me to decide whether or not this radical shift is a success, but I do think it fits the spirit of the game better. Speaking of the spirit of the game, the other crucial change in the sequel is the ability to operate a wide variety of vehicles, including planes, boats, and off-road buggies. Providing players with such a vast world only to restrict them to the ground never made much sense, so Ivory Tower decided to allow players to take to the sea and the sky as well in the sequel. That alone would have been a welcome inclusion, but the way in which the studio implemented the new vehicles is what stands out. While there are plenty of events scattered throughout the map specifically for cars, boats, or planes, but as you are exploring the open world, you have the ability to swap between the three at will with the press of a button. I'm not exaggerating when I say I could have spent hours racing down a city street at full speed in a sports car with a building fast approaching only to morph into a jet at the last moment and swerve out of danger. Then, moments later, I would find myself gliding over a lake or a river and realize I could plop into the water with the boat I had saved to my Fast Fav menu (where you can keep one of each type of vehicle for quick access at all times). And yet, as enthralled as I was with the vehicle switching and the open-ended campaign, I was most relieved to find that the mechanics of the game have been completely overhauled. The Crew 2 isn't going to give the best racers on the market a run for their money, but the act of maneuvering the vehicles is significantly more pleasant than it was in the first game. I didn't feel like I was sliding all over the road like a bar of soap, which is a major upgrade. I also didn't notice quite as much rubber-banding from the AI opponents, though it did seem nearly impossible to lose them, no matter how well I raced. Furthermore, the boats and the planes are mechanically sound too. They're fresh enough to not feel identical to the cars, but you won't be lost or confused when switching between them. I'm somewhat concerned about the longevity of The Crew 2, as the map isn't as dense as many modern open world games with quests and characters and secrets around every corner, but the foundation is solid. Despite having given up on The Crew fairly early on, I walked away from The Crew 2 anxious to jump back in. The Crew 2 launches for PS4, Xbox One and PC on June 29th, 2018.","published_at":1526486716,"content_id":"a094ab3e-df8e-3abf-813c-56c5a1a9459c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/crew-2-delivers-potential-predecessor-160042524.html","content_published_at":1526486442,"content_time":1526486442,"content_relative_time":51,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":51,"comment_relative_time":51,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f34a42bd-8bbb-3b56-808c-3f5306f25b74","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b7de3a9c-bd4d-3a9b-a0f1-9c986d88655f_a-f34a42bd-8bbb-3b56-808c-3f5306f25b74","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-b7de3a9c-bd4d-3a9b-a0f1-9c986d88655f_a-f34a42bd-8bbb-3b56-808c-3f5306f25b74","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/world-demons-first-major-mobile-9lw8x2w","author":"third_watch","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/olliebarder\/2018\/05\/16\/world-of-demons-is-the-first-major-mobile-game-for-platinum-games\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iQbMveraYxF3sISvEFXW3g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/68eVKayXJRnjLMX2zaAQkw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f34a42bd-8bbb-3b56-808c-3f5306f25b74--541155815.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eJB8IGy31d2CkHoBmeizug--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTU7dz02MDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/68eVKayXJRnjLMX2zaAQkw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f34a42bd-8bbb-3b56-808c-3f5306f25b74--541155815.jpeg","height":315,"width":600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/68eVKayXJRnjLMX2zaAQkw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f34a42bd-8bbb-3b56-808c-3f5306f25b74--541155815.jpeg","imgw":600,"imgh":315,"title":"'World Of Demons' Is The First Major Mobile Game For Platinum Games","summary":"The first major mobile game for Platinum Games will be World of Demons for DeNA.

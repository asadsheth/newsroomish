There is not telling how long they'll be available for, so if you're interested, you should act quickly.

The patch is rolling out to all platforms today. The big addition in this update is Tournaments. This is a multiplayer feature that enables groups of people to create and participate in an organized tournament from within Rocket League. While the car-soccer game debuted in 2015 and is ideal for a tournament-style event, you previously had to use external tournament platforms that did not have a lot of integration with Rocket League. In Rocket League Tournaments, anyone can start their own competition and set the parameters.","published_at":1522846840,"content_id":"0f9c4cbe-75ca-3d39-9759-bba61d39948d","content_url":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/04\/03\/rocket-leagues-tournaments-update-is-live-with-nintendo-switch-upgrades\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+venturebeat%2FSZYF+%28VentureBeat%29","content_published_at":1522790474,"content_time":1522790474,"content_relative_time":42,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":42,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c33367af-4f33-3e96-9d0b-cd1dadc82b68","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-951c3f89-b746-3ff8-94f0-d430c583defc_a-c33367af-4f33-3e96-9d0b-cd1dadc82b68","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-951c3f89-b746-3ff8-94f0-d430c583defc_a-c33367af-4f33-3e96-9d0b-cd1dadc82b68","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/forbes-writer-says-start-playing-39w5y9h","author":"nanook","provider":"DeseretNews.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.deseretnews.com\/article\/900014816\/Forbes-writer-says-you-should-start-playing-Pokemon-Go-again-Herersquos-why.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/r1suiPSP90tBtq_TmEg.Zw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D6AOYdm7fLIrQNc76aNBSQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Nzk5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c33367af-4f33-3e96-9d0b-cd1dadc82b68-221728493.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/okv42MgVxqAE9mB.5hK5bA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03OTk7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D6AOYdm7fLIrQNc76aNBSQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Nzk5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c33367af-4f33-3e96-9d0b-cd1dadc82b68-221728493.jpeg","height":799,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D6AOYdm7fLIrQNc76aNBSQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9Nzk5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c33367af-4f33-3e96-9d0b-cd1dadc82b68-221728493.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":799,"title":"Forbes writer says you should start playing Pokemon Go again.

One of the better ways to go fully undetected is to snipe outpost guards from a distance before getting up close and personal\u2014if you get in close at all. One immensely helpful booster is Ultimate Hunter, a crafted substance made in the weapons menu that will \u201cautomatically tag all the animals and enemies in your sight and make predators flee.\u201d It's temporary, and you can only hold three at a time, but that should be enough to get a good head start on any outpost, and it will help you hold your concentration and hide your position by ensuring hostile animals will keep their distance.

Hecker invited me under the pretenses of unveiling news about his long-in-development one-on-one video game SpyParty\u2014one I have followed for years, owing to its tense and truly unique face-offs. Every three-minute match pits one \"spy,\" who acts like an AI character at a video game party, against a sniper, who watches the entire party play out before guessing who the human is among the computer-controlled crowd. Sure enough, Hecker had specific news to share: an April 12 launch date for the game on Steam Early Access, a new slew of game features, and a $25 price.","published_at":1522814177,"content_id":"889424f9-ac6d-3cab-a579-5d14902871ed","content_url":"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gaming\/2018\/04\/competitive-sniping-game-spyparty-finally-hits-steam-after-8-years-100000\/?comments=1","content_published_at":1522681200,"content_time":1522681200,"content_relative_time":73,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":73,"comment_relative_time":73,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

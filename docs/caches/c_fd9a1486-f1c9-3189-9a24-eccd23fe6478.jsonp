Since Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action adventure game, while the Killzone games were fairly linear first-person shooter titles, Guerrilla Games had a lot of work to do in order to make sure that Horizon Zero Dawn would be a good game.

Rob and Joey have decided to take a dive back into Kingdom Come to dial the game's graphics back to an equally punishing level.

I know, I know. 1080p\/30 is not the holy grail of PC gaming, but consider this: Guru3D ran tests across a staggering 26 graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD at 1080p using Far Cry 5's Ultra quality preset, and found that not a single one dipped below an average of 30fps.

Our first look at the next set of new cards coming to the game was in a Blair Witch-style reveal video, but as a pre-cursor to more card reveals happening throughout the coming weeks, Blizzard's Dave Kozack and Dean Ayala dropped by the GameSpot office to discuss Witchwood's development. And for even more Hearthstone talk, check out the video above, where we play through the Kobolds and Catacombs Dungeon Run along with mission designer Dave Kozack while discussing the upcoming Monster Hunter mode. We learned a very valuable lesson in this (embarrassingly unsuccessful) run: never underestimate your opponent.","published_at":1522089545,"content_id":"c37be263-e0b8-3654-b29e-7becd357b424","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/hearthstone-witchwood-devs-mission-to-make-everyth\/1100-6457633\/","content_published_at":1521808200,"content_time":1521808200,"content_relative_time":107,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":107,"comment_relative_time":107,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-48855a67-eddb-3547-9291-975392c3633f_a-728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-48855a67-eddb-3547-9291-975392c3633f_a-728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-48855a67-eddb-3547-9291-975392c3633f_a-728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/insertcoin\/2018\/03\/23\/heres-one-trick-you-must-know-as-a-solo-sea-of-thieves-player\/?partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3z79ymMHg4AVKmdRkdenIA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cyR.H6F8026nrRYTddvKQA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e--1908994905.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/.rm4QqCTBLtnynH5FD5NSQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzQ7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cyR.H6F8026nrRYTddvKQA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e--1908994905.jpeg","height":434,"width":640,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cyR.H6F8026nrRYTddvKQA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e--1908994905.jpeg","imgw":640,"imgh":434,"title":"Here's One Trick You Must Know As A Solo 'Sea of Thieves' Player","summary":"Sea of Thieves is very up front about the challenges of being a solo player in the game. While this is left for players to figure out themselves (like most things in Sea of Thieves), the way the smaller Sloop is designed, what you can actually do is simply turn around from the wheel, look over the back edge of the ship, and voila, you can have a full view of the map without having to run all the way down there. It's kind of ingenious, but if 95% of solo players didn't know you could do this, I wouldn't be surprised, so I thought I'd just spell it out here. While your high-up view of the map does not allow you to interact with it like you can on the ground floor, even having a cursory look at the direction you're heading without having to run all the way downstairs is incredibly welcome when you're sailing solo.","published_at":1522139605,"content_id":"728b120b-be93-34b6-86e6-d32dbfac2b2e","content_url":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/insertcoin\/2018\/03\/23\/heres-one-trick-you-must-know-as-a-solo-sea-of-thieves-player\/?partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1521812100,"content_time":1521812100,"content_relative_time":106,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":106,"comment_relative_time":106,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8af2bfe0-abd0-3702-81e7-855169046768","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-3c04b540-473a-31ef-8227-ea5dc523be42_a-8af2bfe0-abd0-3702-81e7-855169046768","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-3c04b540-473a-31ef-8227-ea5dc523be42_a-8af2bfe0-abd0-3702-81e7-855169046768","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-3c04b540-473a-31ef-8227-ea5dc523be42_a-8af2bfe0-abd0-3702-81e7-855169046768","author":"third_watch","provider":"Market Realist","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/marketrealist.com\/2018\/03\/google-joins-facebook-in-rejecting-cryptocurrency-ads\/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/WJToBbF_m21BrpmP51cBLQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/marketrealist.com\/e0cbeb0993839be35a3d960130fcb23a","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hXlCw_lcQ42_SqnvuLWkSQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00Mjc7dz02MjA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/marketrealist.com\/e0cbeb0993839be35a3d960130fcb23a","height":427,"width":620,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/marketrealist.com\/e0cbeb0993839be35a3d960130fcb23a","imgw":620,"imgh":427,"title":"Google Joins Facebook in Rejecting Cryptocurrency Ads","summary":"Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google is joining Facebook (FB) in banning cryptocurrency advertisements.

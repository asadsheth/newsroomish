And before you ask, no, we don't know what happened to Fallout 5 - 75. Bethesda appears to be following the same pattern for Fallout 76 as it did with Fallout 4. The last core entry in the series was officially announced weeks before E3 2015, but didn't provide many details about the game itself. All we knew was that it was the follow-up to Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. But this year's announcement is even more cryptic, as the title suggests that Fallout 76 won't be an entirely traditional Fallout game. I have no doubt that die-hard fans of the series will find plenty of clues in the trailer, but there aren't any obvious hints as to how the game will compare to the previous three open world entries. We do know that a group of vault dwellers recently celebrated \"Reclamation Day\" and that Vault 76 will play a major role, but not much else: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-ye84Zrqndo The only other potentially concrete information we have comes from a Kotaku report in which Jason Schreier claims that Fallout 76 \"will be an online game of some sort,\" and that both Bethesda Game Studios' main office in Maryland and their Austin branch are handling development of the game. Bethesda says that we'll learn much more about the game during its E3 2018 showcase in Los Angeles, which takes place on Sunday, June 10th at 6:30 PM PT \/ 9:30 PM ET and will be streamed live around the world.","published_at":1527690325,"content_id":"a72e5b6e-d977-33b4-9465-f2fcddc9af44","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/watch-first-trailer-fallout-76-bethesda-mysterious-game-140616681.html","content_published_at":1527689176,"content_time":1527689176,"content_relative_time":3,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":3,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"8c4bc4dc-8509-39fd-9ab2-8ae8c4dd6afb","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-cd5f108a-558d-3c3d-953a-dc001503ac8b_a-8c4bc4dc-8509-39fd-9ab2-8ae8c4dd6afb","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-cd5f108a-558d-3c3d-953a-dc001503ac8b_a-8c4bc4dc-8509-39fd-9ab2-8ae8c4dd6afb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/interactive-gaming-ventures-fund-indie-3du85em","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"VentureBeat","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/05\/30\/interactive-gaming-ventures-will-fund-indie-titles-made-with-unreal-engine-4\/","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Interactive Gaming Ventures will fund indie titles made with Unreal Engine 4","summary":"Interactive Gaming Ventures launched in March with the goal of funding two to three indie games per year.

For many millennials, the reason behind it is simple: childhood memories. Friends Adam Irlander and Russell Boyle made the trip from New Jersey Tuesday night to sell some of their old video games at J & L Game in Manhattan. While they had some retro pieces in the mix, for the most part, they're keeping those games and consoles near and dear. Adam said he still has his Nintendo DS, the original Gameboy, and other systems. For gamers, there is nothing quite like the old school, vintage stuff. After all, nothing beats nostalgia.

The game immediately set itself apart with its contemporary setting, a realistic depiction of a snow-covered New York City enveloped in a pandemic crisis. Two years later, Ubisoft has announced that a sequel is in the works and that it's set to appear at E3 2018. To prepare you for what's ahead, here's what we know about Tom Clancy's The Division 2, as well as what we're hoping to see from it at this year's E3. What We Know So Far The Division 2 was first revealed when news of the game leaked through stock website 4-Traders in March 2018.

Miami Street is a PC game developed by the UK's Electric Square, but it's not available in all markets yet. Unlike the other popular Microsoft Studios racing franchises -- Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon -- Miami Street doesn't feature realistic racing or a massive open world. Instead, you simply hold down a button (or hold your finger to the touchscreen) to accelerate, and release to brake. Simplicity for every Windows 10 device is key. Here's what Electric Square had to say about Miami Street on its website shortly after the game launched: We\u2019ve got some exciting news to share. We proudly announce Miami Street, a project that Electric Square has been working on with our partners at Microsoft Studios. Developed to be played on any Windows 10 PC device, Miami Street is a new kind of racing game, built for a broad audience who love easy to pick-up-and-play experiences. As we continue the development of Miami Street in the months ahead, we will begin releasing the game in limited regions for testing and player feedback. Other than the blurb on Electric Square's website and the appearance of the game on the Microsoft Store, there don't appear to be any press releases or blog posts from Microsoft regarding the game. The stealth-launch is indeed weird, but Windows Central seems to believe that Miami Street could end up being one of the first games ever released for the upcoming Andromeda OS, which may accompany a new foldable tablet. That said, we won't know anything concrete about why Miami Street exists or where it came from until Microsoft says something about it. In the meantime, you can download the game for free from the Microsoft Store right now.","published_at":1527564917,"content_id":"b4305143-237d-34d1-a04b-33ee39972ceb","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/miami-street-brand-free-play-racing-game-microsoft-033454699.html","content_published_at":1527564894,"content_time":1527564894,"content_relative_time":38,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":38,"comment_relative_time":38,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

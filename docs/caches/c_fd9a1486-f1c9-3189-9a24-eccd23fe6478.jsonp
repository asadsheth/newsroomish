Usually, the hacker group called CPY is the one who comes with cracks for games using Denuvo DRM, however, in the case of Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition, Chinese crack group, 3DM, is the one to crack it. Furthermore, the game being cracked might have nothing to do with the Denuvo at all, as the group itself noted that they used the \u201c.exe\u201d file from the game's recently released playable demo on Steam and unlocked the full Final Fantasy 15 Windows Edition from the unencrypted pre-load files downloaded through Origin. It seems to be a clever workaround rather than a full-fledged crack for the game and Square Enix might fix this, however, the game has already been uploaded to torrent sites.","published_at":1520235634,"content_id":"4a3b4d6e-fb30-3505-8295-139fbee57ad8","content_url":"https:\/\/segmentnext.com\/2018\/03\/05\/final-fantasy-15-windows-edition-cracked\/","content_published_at":1520235228,"content_time":1520235228,"content_relative_time":15,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":15,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-ccd85c4b-936d-3806-ba5d-a8bb7d3b04c3_a-d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-ccd85c4b-936d-3806-ba5d-a8bb7d3b04c3_a-d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/student-health-services-holding-video-5d3ex6w","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Daily Gamecock","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailygamecock.com\/article\/2018\/03\/video-games-mental-health","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HUTxHMdjmOYTvpPeyySFvw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c2Q4RhLBb3WpwqOBvtDmnA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NDI0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94--107530839.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6WP1XXcT6b.3aBtNWU9EMg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MjQ7dz0xMDAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c2Q4RhLBb3WpwqOBvtDmnA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NDI0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94--107530839.jpeg","height":424,"width":1000,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/c2Q4RhLBb3WpwqOBvtDmnA--\/dz0xMDAwO2g9NDI0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d881b3c5-44b1-3e6d-9b5a-37aed48bcf94--107530839.jpeg","imgw":1000,"imgh":424,"title":"Student Health Services holding video game and mental health convention","summary":"When the average person thinks about video games, his or her mind may go in many directions, with the majority of them involving explosions, mushroom-based power-ups or plasma grenades.

As Paul Tassi says, the Battle Pass is a smart compromise between the realities of free-to-play economics and the exploitative nature of loot boxes: it works like a sort of optional subscription system that people who play the game religiously are more than happy to participate in. The Battle Pass itself is no joke: two weeks in and I'm at Tier 24 having done a fair number of challenges and put in a good amount of time, even if all of that time was without a victory or a sniper kill (I hate snipers). The theoretical apex reward in the battle pass is a skin that transforms your character into John Wick, someone that looks exactly like John Wick, and it's a great piece of loot to quest after.","published_at":1520197874,"content_id":"ed9e3487-2edc-3e39-8f0e-a32d2f53e50b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidthier\/2018\/03\/04\/high-octane-glider-how-to-get-the-secret-tier-100-challenge-reward-in-fortnite-battle-royale\/","content_published_at":1520139600,"content_time":1520139600,"content_relative_time":42,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":42,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"9404b2a5-0fde-331d-883a-85b1c44f4cb7","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-82f42f62-c987-379e-9a64-1897923b8a10_a-9404b2a5-0fde-331d-883a-85b1c44f4cb7","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-82f42f62-c987-379e-9a64-1897923b8a10_a-9404b2a5-0fde-331d-883a-85b1c44f4cb7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/dubais-massive-vr-park-debuts-49eivfy","author":"nanook","provider":"VentureBeat","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/?p=2329630","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/OSuibWwf.k43fOe_OvPQew--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vBSEbdCxyEZL4q9tJy0jXA--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NjgzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9404b2a5-0fde-331d-883a-85b1c44f4cb7--259646795.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/_d_CIMqEyfue08Aeu1OH.g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0Ow--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vBSEbdCxyEZL4q9tJy0jXA--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NjgzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9404b2a5-0fde-331d-883a-85b1c44f4cb7--259646795.jpeg","height":683,"width":1024,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vBSEbdCxyEZL4q9tJy0jXA--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NjgzO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_9404b2a5-0fde-331d-883a-85b1c44f4cb7--259646795.jpeg","imgw":1024,"imgh":683,"title":"Dubai's massive new VR Park debuts with StarVR","summary":"Starbreeze's StarVR headset is the star (sorry) of a new VR arcade that's now open in Dubai.

The web is unparalleled in its capacity to get VR games in front of end users, and get them playing, since it bypasses so much of the friction that otherwise serves as one of the chief headaches for the industry: distribution. There's also WebVR's forthcoming seismic upgrade to the WebXR API, which will soon allow developers to create mixed reality content that is responsive across the full spectrum of immersive computing devices. The implications this opens up are profound insofar as it expands the potential reach for any single piece of content that developers ship, and in the context of games it means that any player with virtually any gadget or gear will now be able to play, wherever they are and on their own terms.","published_at":1519861610,"content_id":"ca674496-8b09-3beb-9bf4-17aa33b06270","content_url":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/?p=2328792","content_published_at":1519861525,"content_time":1519861525,"content_relative_time":119,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":119,"comment_relative_time":119,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c91ddfc6-5721-3a8b-af81-414da9d6e580_a-7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-c91ddfc6-5721-3a8b-af81-414da9d6e580_a-7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/war-stories-brad-wardell-poor-413osqm","author":"third_watch","provider":"Ars Technica","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gaming\/2018\/02\/war-stories-brad-wardell-remembers-the-mystery-error-that-killed-elemental\/?comments=1&post=34897989","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mFxDVB_DQRkN3TYsKKxZFQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J.zlHgbUC7oZpkS9aKiGWA--\/dz03NjA7aD0zODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7--1860944956.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7VFCyZMdazEKJSa3yWhP5A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODA7dz03NjA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J.zlHgbUC7oZpkS9aKiGWA--\/dz03NjA7aD0zODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7--1860944956.jpeg","height":380,"width":760,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/J.zlHgbUC7oZpkS9aKiGWA--\/dz03NjA7aD0zODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7a60c82d-4949-32ad-89f0-1a72d50be7b7--1860944956.jpeg","imgw":760,"imgh":380,"title":"War Stories: Brad Wardell on how poor memory management crippled Elemental","summary":"Welcome back to \"War Stories,\" our ongoing video series looking at game devs tackling complex programming challenges.

It's important to note that the Aloy armor set and bow is only available from February 28 to March 15, so if you're keen to get them, you'd best nab them as soon as possible.

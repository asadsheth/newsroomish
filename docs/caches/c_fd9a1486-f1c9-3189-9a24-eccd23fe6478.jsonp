Instead, for the first half of the 46th annual race, which has a course that features views of the city's monuments amid the newly bloomed cherry blossom trees, the men stayed together. Until about the sixth mile, there were about 20 runners in the lead group, proving the deep talent pool this year's competition offered. But in the last stretches of the course, a few pulled ahead and as Ethiopia's Jemal Yimer, 21, reached the nine-mile marker, he made his move to the front of the lead group.

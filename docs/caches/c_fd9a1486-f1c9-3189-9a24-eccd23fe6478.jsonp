But how long is the campaign? Executive producer Dan Hay says you should budget a good chunk of time to play the campaign--around 25 hours--but that's just the start. \"I would say that a good player will go through it in 25 hours,\" Hay told GameSpot during an interview recently. Hay went on to say that, based on playtests, Ubisoft has seen players getting distracted from the main story with things like fishing or hunting, which will extend the total playtime. Of course, everyone plays differently, and in a game like Far Cry 5 that lets you play your own way, 25 hours could turn into many more.","published_at":1521515323,"content_id":"12d8d2dc-7846-3c02-a2c5-476c60cf3e83","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/far-cry-5s-campaign-could-take-you-25-hours-or-mor\/1100-6457522\/","content_published_at":1521482940,"content_time":1521482940,"content_relative_time":30,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":30,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1844c81f-6e08-369f-92cc-636546029fd0","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-857ab73a-49a5-3f7b-a325-47762b4c160f_a-1844c81f-6e08-369f-92cc-636546029fd0","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-857ab73a-49a5-3f7b-a325-47762b4c160f_a-1844c81f-6e08-369f-92cc-636546029fd0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/nikes-letting-people-try-sneakers-5y61s0c","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Sole Collector","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/solecollector.com\/news\/2018\/03\/nike-launches-virtual-reality-sneaker-try-on-game-reactland-china","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3jeXB4QLG3jm1rpxvc9VyA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dWy_7WCosAvMoVTdSkmJSw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NzQwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1844c81f-6e08-369f-92cc-636546029fd0--1609770527.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7Fg_ZONFdiq5.S8hHd7Bmg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD03NDA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dWy_7WCosAvMoVTdSkmJSw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NzQwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1844c81f-6e08-369f-92cc-636546029fd0--1609770527.jpeg","height":740,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dWy_7WCosAvMoVTdSkmJSw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NzQwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1844c81f-6e08-369f-92cc-636546029fd0--1609770527.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":740,"title":"Nike Brings a Virtual Reality Experience to the Epic React","summary":"Nike's latest fusion of technology and product marketing is centered around one of its latest running models, the Epic React Flyknit.

They've kept on adding new chapters with the series even going as far as creating a \u201cYakuza 0\u201d that looks at early days of Kiryu. The other part of the effort is the remastering of the past entries to the series with \u201cYakuza Kiwami 2\u201d coming in August.

(AP) - The city of Rockford could have one of the stiffest video gaming fees in Illinois if voters approve home rule.

A referendum will be included on the Tuesday primary ballot that asks city voters to approve home rule authority in Rockford. Home rule would provide Rockford with broader powers to tax and govern itself.

Each one of its sequels eventually made their way to Steam, remastered to play on modern systems, but Age of Empires, the game that started it all, was nowhere to be found.

Where is my LEGO The Incredibles game?\" It's close, Frozone. Yesterday, The Brick Fan, a site for LEGO-related news and reviews, posted a teaser it spotted for a LEGO game based on Disney-Pixar's superhero property. The Brick Fan's owner, Allen Tran, espied the game ad on the back of a box for a LEGO Juniors Incredibles 2 set. Warner Bros has yet to make an official announcement about the game, but the ad indicates it's coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and the Nintendo Switch. The Incredibles 2 is coming to theatres in June, which means we can probably expect the game to drop around the same time.

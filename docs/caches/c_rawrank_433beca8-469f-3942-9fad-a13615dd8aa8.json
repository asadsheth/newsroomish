One officer broke an arm and the suspect was wounded by gunfire in the incident, which began around 1:30 a.m. at the Trump-owned Trump National Doral Golf Club. Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez identified the suspect as 42-year-old Jonathan Oddi of Doral.","published_at":1526640356,"content_id":"7f57a894-e05a-36d2-ae36-be3a44661e37","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/police-person-arrested-shots-fired-trump-golf-club-074528684.html","content_published_at":1526655733,"content_time":1526655733,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":2520,"vibe_name":"President Trump","vibe_id":"433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":2,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

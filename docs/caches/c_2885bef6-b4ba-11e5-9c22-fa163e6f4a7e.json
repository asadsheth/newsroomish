While U.S. public support for more gun control measures has grown slowly but steadily over the years, it typically spikes immediately after the mass shootings that have become part of the U.S. landscape, then falls back to pre-massacre levels within a few months. The poll https:\/\/bit.ly\/2GEdYkl found that 69 percent of American adults supported strong or moderate regulations or restrictions for firearms, down from 75 percent in late March, when the first poll was conducted following the Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The new poll numbers are virtually unchanged from pre-Parkland levels.","published_at":1527109032,"content_id":"65f2c118-5187-35fb-b35c-f05e8a4f0ad3","content_url":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/parklands-neveragain-movement-didnt-sway-gun-control-opinion-poll-2018-5","content_published_at":1527051600,"content_time":1527051600,"content_relative_time":37,"reaction_count":1,"vibe_name":"Gun control debate","vibe_id":"2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":37,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457","post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c647dbf0-a2ab-334a-a398-5195bc3aa740_a-acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c647dbf0-a2ab-334a-a398-5195bc3aa740_a-acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/gun-control-debate\/v-2885bef6-b4ba-11e5-9c22-fa163e6f4a7e_c-c647dbf0-a2ab-334a-a398-5195bc3aa740_a-acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Winona Daily News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.winonadailynews.com\/news\/national\/texas-governor-s-school-safety-talks-to-tackle-gun-control\/article_3a5f7f45-f871-591d-91c4-ceadc8e42f51.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/NM7gAiHRioUoh0Eq6OiUYQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vgbhlZ87CoULaGvNmdMxZA--\/dz0xMTIwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457-1281432317.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/caPzL9jCaVN1am1GcUn5rw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMTIwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vgbhlZ87CoULaGvNmdMxZA--\/dz0xMTIwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457-1281432317.jpeg","height":630,"width":1120,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vgbhlZ87CoULaGvNmdMxZA--\/dz0xMTIwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_acf2b670-3781-30ca-996b-ab8ee5aa4457-1281432317.jpeg","imgw":1120,"imgh":630,"title":"Texas governor's school safety talks to tackle gun control","summary":"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's meetings on school violence and safety promised to wade into the thorny issue of gun control with the next round, even though the Republican has been a staunch supporter of gun rights and worked to expand them in the state in recent years. Abbott called for a series of high-level policy meetings after a high school near Houston became the latest to have a mass shooting.

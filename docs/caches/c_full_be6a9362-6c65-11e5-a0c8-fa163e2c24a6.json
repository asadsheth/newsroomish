demonstration: peaceful protest or Hamas-led attack?","summary":"On Monday 60 Palestinians were killed along the Israel-Gaza border, with critics saying the Jewish state's soldiers fired indiscriminately on thousands of protesters. Israel accused Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas of using the protests to carry out attacks. Beginning March 30, Palestinians have been protesting along the Gaza-Israel border for the right to return to the homes their families fled in 1948, during the war surrounding the creation of Israel.","published_at":1526646982,"content_id":"44a412b3-32fc-35de-be4d-c829e45536f4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gaza-demonstration-peaceful-protest-hamas-led-attack-112632987.html","content_published_at":1526642792,"content_time":1526642792,"content_relative_time":104,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Israeli-Palestinian unrest","vibe_id":"be6a9362-6c65-11e5-a0c8-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":104,"comment_relative_time":104,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]

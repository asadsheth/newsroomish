What was up with spring training? Ohtani's performance in the spring was poor enough to create the narrative that he was \u2013 at best \u2013 not ready for the majors and \u2013 at worst \u2013 just not as good as his reputation. At one point, an anonymous scout was quoted saying that Ohtani looked like a high school hitter. As he heads into the third start of his career as a pitcher, on Tuesday night at Angel Stadium, he's seemingly put those ideas to rest. As a pitcher, he is 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA.

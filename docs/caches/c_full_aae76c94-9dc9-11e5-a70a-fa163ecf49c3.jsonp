Kay and YES Network are putting the finishing touches on a three-year contract with a network option for two more.\u00a0The deal calls for a salary of more than a million dollars per season. Kay is believed to be the highest-paid local baseball announcer in the game. He took that mantle when fellow Fordham alum Vin Scully retired from the Dodgers after the 2016 season. YES is currently owned by Fox Sports, which broadcasts 22 of the 30 MLB teams. At the end of the three years, Kay will be 60 years old. He wants to call Yankee games for as long as possible. \u201cI don't see any end in sight,\u201d","published_at":1528824108,"content_id":"51b2dc7c-1715-3596-b615-7982272a849a","content_url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2018\/06\/12\/michael-kay-will-stay-yankees-voice-after-unique-negotiations\/","content_published_at":1528819957,"content_time":1528819957,"content_relative_time":23,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":23,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

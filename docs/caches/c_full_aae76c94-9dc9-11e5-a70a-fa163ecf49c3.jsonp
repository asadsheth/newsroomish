How did Arrieta plummet from award-winning grace to March unemployment? The most obvious culprit is his agent, Scott Boras. Boras has built a legend by landing his clients gaudy paydays.

This model simulated the entire season 10,000 times and found five MLB teams whose Vegas win totals are way off. This same model just crushed the NFL and college basketball.

and supplanting 1987 in terms of unexpectedness? Well, 2017 laughed at that notion and bumped the home rate by another 10 percent, setting a new all-time record at 1.26 home runs per team per game. So now the question is whether 2018 will surpass even last year's \"Year of the Homer 2: Electric Boogaloo.\" The most maddening aspect of guessing where offense is going in baseball is the why. A 25 percent increase in homers over a two-year period is a stunning change. A similar change occurred from 1992 to 1994, and even a quarter of a century later, that shift is still largely unexplained.","published_at":1519650657,"content_id":"640aeeb5-11cd-3e0f-bff6-c83e9846f6b3","content_url":"http:\/\/kwese.espn.com\/mlb\/insider\/story\/_\/id\/22578326\/mlb-homers-drop-2018-which-players-teams-helped-hurt-most","content_published_at":1519590707,"content_time":1519590707,"content_relative_time":240,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":240,"comment_relative_time":240,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"7b3a2ddf-9516-36d5-ab47-df2e42406791","post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-d2993cfa-ad92-3a15-adb0-2b9f7be332d1_a-7b3a2ddf-9516-36d5-ab47-df2e42406791","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-d2993cfa-ad92-3a15-adb0-2b9f7be332d1_a-7b3a2ddf-9516-36d5-ab47-df2e42406791","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/integrity-fees-controlling-bet-mlbs-2t4iyzy","author":"third_watch","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/maurybrown\/2018\/02\/26\/from-integrity-fees-to-controlling-what-to-bet-on-mlbs-framework-for-legalized-sports-betting\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cdgZsvzoAcGwESCtOqWH8A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AkUVm.hThOUM5J4GkUxwog--\/dz05NjA7aD02NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7b3a2ddf-9516-36d5-ab47-df2e42406791-355998749.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Eu7Fr5JFRjHW2u8fJu5cVg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02NDA7dz05NjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AkUVm.hThOUM5J4GkUxwog--\/dz05NjA7aD02NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7b3a2ddf-9516-36d5-ab47-df2e42406791-355998749.jpeg","height":640,"width":960,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AkUVm.hThOUM5J4GkUxwog--\/dz05NjA7aD02NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_7b3a2ddf-9516-36d5-ab47-df2e42406791-355998749.jpeg","imgw":960,"imgh":640,"title":"From 'Integrity Fees' To Controlling What To Bet On, MLB's Framework For Legalized Sports Betting","summary":"For decades, Major League Baseball has taken betting on its games as one of it's most serious matters.

The suspected shooter was being brought in for treatment. According to multiple media reports after the Feb. 14 shooting, the hospital personnel treated the suspect, who was not seriously injured, like they would have any other patient. That's part of the emergency room doctor's job, said Dr. Arvind Venkat, vice president of the Pennsylvania College of Emergency Physicians.

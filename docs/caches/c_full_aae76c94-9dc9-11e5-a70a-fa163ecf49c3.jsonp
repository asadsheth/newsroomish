Bullets will make it better","summary":"Free agent pitcher Alex Cobb waited all winter, but he's finally found a new team as he's agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. This assumes he passes the physical, which is no sure thing with the Orioles. David Schoenfield looks at where Cobb fits in with the Orioles. He fills a big need and he makes the Orioles better, but they still seem to be far from competing in the AL East. It is interesting, Schoenfield notes, that Cobb waited out the market and got the contract he was looking for at the start of the winter (or at least the contract that was projected for him). Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner has a broken wrist after being hit in the hand by a fastball by Athletics pitcher Kendall Graveman.","published_at":1521856255,"content_id":"1904707d-2797-33fa-9710-e2202cb24f40","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bleedcubbieblue.com\/2018\/3\/21\/17146264\/mlb-bullets-alex-cobb-orioles-justin-turner-injury-yankees-red-sox-london-bob-uecker-tough","content_published_at":1521608400,"content_time":1521608400,"content_relative_time":136,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":136,"comment_relative_time":136,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

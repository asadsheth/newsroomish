They traded Todd Frazier in an offseason that was overstuffed with third basemen, not the previous trade deadline, when he was an all-star on pace to hit 45 or 50 homers. They traded Johnny Cueto when he had a couple of months left on his contract, not a year-plus, when he would have netted all of the prospects. Brandon Phillips rejected trades that would have helped. And, of course, they traded Aroldis Chapman in the two-month window when teams pretended to care about his domestic violence case, which meant they got a modest return.

Cincinnati fired its fifth-year manager on Thursday because of a 3-15 start, the first managerial change in the major leagues this season. The Reds hadn't changed managers so early in a season since Tony Perez was fired after 44 games in 1993. It's the first time since 2002 that a manager has been fired in April, according to ESPN. Four managers were fired that April, including Phil Garner after an 0-6 start with the Tigers that matched the quickest hook in major league history. Price managed a rebuilding effort that relied on rookies more than any other team in the majors during his tenure.","published_at":1524157515,"content_id":"8eec59de-54fe-37b3-b44f-2a8e60911f9d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/mlb\/2018\/04\/19\/reds-fire-manager-bryan-price-after-3-15-start\/33976589\/","content_published_at":1524142691,"content_time":1524142691,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":27,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

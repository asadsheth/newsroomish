Ten years ago, it might've sounded crazy, but today it's taken as a given: the NBA and NFL employ many of the most stylish men alive. Major League Baseball, on the other hand, has some catching up to do in the style department. Let's just say we don't study these guys' pre-game tunnel fits with the rapt attention we reserve for hoops. Which makes it all the more amusing that what we've taken to calling baseball player style is having a fashion moment right now. Think Oakley-style shades, and batting practice-ready cutoffs.

Street regulator sanctions Tezos cryptocurrency project co-founder","summary":"A Wall Street regulator has suspended the co-founder of the controversial Tezos cryptocurrency project from associating with broker-dealers for two years, part of a settlement to resolve allegations that he made false statements about his side venture while working at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fined Arthur Breitman $20,000 for the alleged violations, which he neither admitted nor denied, in an agreement dated April 18. The action follows a Reuters investigation https:\/\/reut.rs\/2gPOMNH published in October that found Breitman, a French citizen registered with FINRA, had not reported any outside business activities while working at Morgan Stanley in 2014 and 2015 when he was developing and pitching Tezos.","published_at":1524178751,"content_id":"a8aa2948-340d-30e6-a2d6-1f30607a480d","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/wall-street-regulator-sanctions-tezos-000329759.html","content_published_at":1524182609,"content_time":1524182609,"content_relative_time":90,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Bitcoin","vibe_id":"98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":90,"comment_relative_time":90,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"c0691116-91ff-390e-8e4a-697868fc3228","post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-e426084e-94f0-3996-af08-2d166d1e1e89_a-c0691116-91ff-390e-8e4a-697868fc3228","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-e426084e-94f0-3996-af08-2d166d1e1e89_a-c0691116-91ff-390e-8e4a-697868fc3228","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/bitcoin\/v-98714316-d8b5-30ad-be71-77f8e9a5eb36_c-e426084e-94f0-3996-af08-2d166d1e1e89_a-c0691116-91ff-390e-8e4a-697868fc3228","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"CNBC","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/","provider_image":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-01-09\/f8412b70-d67f-11e6-8097-412a1bbeb92a_cnbc.png","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/04\/19\/a-global-chipmaking-giant-blames-lowered-outlook-on-bitcoin-mining.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"A global chipmaking giant is blaming a slump in bitcoin mining for its lowered outlook","summary":"An Asian manufacturer that makes chips for bitcoin mining blamed uncertainty over cryptocurrency mining among the reasons for its weaker than expected guidance for the rest of this year.

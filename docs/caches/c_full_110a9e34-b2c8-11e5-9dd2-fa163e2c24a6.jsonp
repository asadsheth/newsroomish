Burks' ability to play fill the \u201cstar\u201d slot in the Commodore defense gave the team a hybrid linebacker-safety who could sneak up to the line of scrimmage and wallop tailbacks or drop into coverage and play centerfield against the SEC's top passing attacks.

Perhaps they took it as a personal attack, or perhaps they took it as an attack on a player they put on a pedestal, but whatever the reason, many fans were simply not happy with the article. In contrast, some fans were extremely happy with it, even offering thanks for writing an article that was critical of Wilson. The comments did a pretty good job of explaining out my point - there is no rush or no need to trade Russ or move on.

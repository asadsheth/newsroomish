The new catch rule, Vincent said, will require only that a receiver have control of the football, and any slight movement of the football in the receiver's hands detected via replay review would not

I know Dak [Prescott] is watching this like, \u2018Yeah, he\u2019s coming.\u2019 Yeah, I am,\u201d Bennett told reporters, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd Alex Smith, he knows he can\u2019t run from me. I told him in the Pro Bowl.\u201dThe Eagles acquired Bennett and a seventh-round pick in exchange for a fifth-round pick and receiver Marcus Johnson.Bennett joins an already fearsome Philadelphia defensive line, with Brandon Graham, Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan, Chris Long, Derek Barnett and Haloti Ngata.The Eagles lost Beau Allen and Vinny Curry this offseason but their absence will be mitigated by the arrival of Bennett and Ngata, giving the team just as much depth along the defensive front as their Super Bowl-winning team did. That\u2019s crucial for defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who likes to rotate his defensive line during games to keep players fresh.","published_at":1521508096,"content_id":"f30a7a1a-a366-304c-8f88-00a54351c4b2","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/michael-bennett-nfc-east-qbs-221315842.html","content_published_at":1521497595,"content_time":1521497595,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":19,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-45886ba2-1ae7-38ff-b7e2-4a9a6d36dce5_a-f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-45886ba2-1ae7-38ff-b7e2-4a9a6d36dce5_a-f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-45886ba2-1ae7-38ff-b7e2-4a9a6d36dce5_a-f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/2018-nfl-mock-draft-2-0-qbs-go-1-2-3-sam-darnold-leading-002014627.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C61HJFI_uN3gM26oKExImQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/ee01b2f0-2bd4-11e8-b536-f311d564c66b_darnoldface.jpg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/RCNO2EgBLVE2kwo3dFLJNw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD04NTM7dz0xMjgwOw--\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/ee01b2f0-2bd4-11e8-b536-f311d564c66b_darnoldface.jpg","height":853,"width":1280,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2018-03-20\/ee01b2f0-2bd4-11e8-b536-f311d564c66b_darnoldface.jpg","imgw":1280,"imgh":853,"title":"2018 NFL mock draft 2.0: QBs go 1-2-3 with Sam Darnold leading","summary":"The rush starts with Sam Darnold going to the Browns.","published_at":1521505214,"content_id":"f1e4dd16-d756-330c-ac02-f22075bd1267","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/2018-nfl-mock-draft-2-0-qbs-go-1-2-3-sam-darnold-leading-002014627.html","content_published_at":1521505214,"content_time":1521505214,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":17,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"4de9fed8-c888-3440-bc8c-bc70836a2755","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-266a3062-93e6-3cd6-9905-a16bae158b33_a-4de9fed8-c888-3440-bc8c-bc70836a2755","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-266a3062-93e6-3cd6-9905-a16bae158b33_a-4de9fed8-c888-3440-bc8c-bc70836a2755","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/report-competition-committee-proposes-allowing-rqt6gj3","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-competition-committee-proposes-allowing-232708484.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aEsTEA7Uu1RJn8Fwxo8IWQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/d00e6b926f3b2cf75aac73ca88ad3096","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3rWJP5DkKKhFgOTwrfJkdw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNDg7dz01MTk7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/d00e6b926f3b2cf75aac73ca88ad3096","height":348,"width":519,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/d00e6b926f3b2cf75aac73ca88ad3096","imgw":519,"imgh":348,"title":"Report: Competition Committee proposes allowing NFL headquarters to eject players","summary":"Everyone agrees Mike Evans and Rob Gronkowski earned ejections for hits after the whistle last season.

And in 2018, their patience with the 6'5\", 270-pound tight end could pay off quickly. Shaheen was a large target at Ashland who galloped downfield, using his size and surprising speed to separate from coverage. His impressive athleticism and wide catch radius led to 867 receiving yards on 57 receptions with 16 touchdowns during his final collegiate season. The steep jump up in competition meant Shaheen wasn't quite ready to be an immediate contributor as a rookie.

The team lost slot corner Aaron Colvin to the Houston Texans on a four-year, $34 million deal, and it seemed as though it would be content to replace him via the draft at a much lower cost. Instead, the Jaguars made the worst signing of free agency to date, inking D.J. Hayden to a three-year, $19 million deal with $9.5 million guaranteed, per Adam Caplan of Sirius XM. The contract value makes no sense, as Hayden reached journeyman status after flaming out with the corner-starved Oakland Raiders and then as a rotational player for the Detroit Lions last year.","published_at":1521196820,"content_id":"d62268b5-5e8f-32f4-98cc-cca947cdaf2a","content_url":"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2764679-ranking-the-nfls-worst-early-free-agency-moves","content_published_at":1521194403,"content_time":1521194403,"content_relative_time":103,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":103,"comment_relative_time":103,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"f6b0ea54-5d62-38cc-9a6a-a48250ba22ef","post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-36406c33-9666-38d2-a661-b83ca0a867c4_a-f6b0ea54-5d62-38cc-9a6a-a48250ba22ef","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-36406c33-9666-38d2-a661-b83ca0a867c4_a-f6b0ea54-5d62-38cc-9a6a-a48250ba22ef","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-36406c33-9666-38d2-a661-b83ca0a867c4_a-f6b0ea54-5d62-38cc-9a6a-a48250ba22ef","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-jordy-nelson-agrees-two-201318825.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/y.DzBpU85G3ysvOE5FRNag--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/446caee48f80b7cfa155d37ff44914cc","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Njg_Vu3vgYEFM_w1w4N2BQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zMTQ7dz00Nzk7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/446caee48f80b7cfa155d37ff44914cc","height":314,"width":479,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/446caee48f80b7cfa155d37ff44914cc","imgw":479,"imgh":314,"title":"Report: Jordy Nelson agrees to two-year, $15 million deal with Raiders","summary":"The Saints and other interested teams didn\u2019t get to make their pitch for Jordy Nelson by getting him to visit.

To do so, the Colts agreed only to drop from No. 3 to No. 6 in the first round. According to our official draft abacus, they slip down three spots to net two more picks in the top 49, totaling four in that span. (They also get a 2019 second-round pick.) At first, as usual, this put immediate attention on that No. 3 spot the Colts gave the Jets, with the focus on the annual tradition of somebody moving up to target some specific player, usually a quarterback.

Brown, 28, returned from a torn ACL injury in 2016 to catch 31 passes for 477 yards and four touchdowns for the Arizona Cardinals in 2017 -- all career highs. The NFL Network was first to report the agreement. The Seahawks reinforced a position of some need following Paul Richardson's departure in free agency. Brown, who is listed at 6-foot-2, 205 pounds and is considered to have good speed at that size, could push 2017 third-round pick Amara Darboh for the No. 3 role behind Doug Baldwin and Tyler Lockett.

Instead, the Jaguars made the worst signing of free agency to date, inking D.J. Hayden to a three-year, $19 million deal with $9.5 million guaranteed, per Adam Caplan of Sirius XM.

Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports that the team has re-signed Johnathan Joseph. It's a two-year deal for the 2006 first-round pick. The Bengals made that pick and employed Joseph for the first five years of his career. He signed with the Texans in 2011 and has been a fixture in their starting lineup over the last seven seasons. He started all 16 games last year and returned one of his two interceptions 82 yards for a touchdown. The Texans also have Kareem Jackson and 2015 first-round pick Kevin Johnson under contract at cornerback.","published_at":1521154115,"content_id":"925af839-a5e2-347d-b0fb-51de6807631c","content_url":"http:\/\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/2018\/03\/15\/texans-re-sign-johnathan-joseph\/","content_published_at":1521125435,"content_time":1521125435,"content_relative_time":100,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":100,"comment_relative_time":100,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);

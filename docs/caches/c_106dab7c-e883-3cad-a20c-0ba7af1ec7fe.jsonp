On Wednesday, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the Yoox Net-a-Porter tech hub in West London where they learnt about the possible uses for artificial intelligence in fashion, met 60 schoolgirls taking part in a coding challenge and browsed rails of British and sustainable designs. Conveniently, a few pieces by designers tipped to be making their future daughter-in-law\u2019s dress were amongst the items available for their perusal. \u201cVery nice stuff,\u201d Prince Charles remarked as Alison Loehnis, Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter President, guided Their Royal Highnesses through pieces from Ralph and Russo\u2019s spring\/ summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection. Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo, founders of the only British label to be accepted by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, are thought to have been chosen by Meghan to create her dress for the daytime ceremony. \u201cHow lovely,\u201d added the Duchess of Cornwall, who wore a pale pink wool crepe skirt suit by Bruce Oldfield, when Loehnis pointed out a floral design by Erdem, another of the favourite contenders. Net-a-Porter's Alison Loehnis shows Charles and Camilla design by British labels Credit: Getty Doria Ragland, Ms. Markle\u2019s mother was pictured on Tuesday leaving her home in Los Angeles carrying a Burberry suit bag, leading to speculation that the British luxury house would be outfitting her- and perhaps other members of the bridal party- on the big day. \u201cThat\u2019s charming,\u201d said the Duchess of Cornwall as she was shown checked items by the label, with a glint of recognition when she came to one of Burberry\u2019s signature trench coats, a design classic she owns herself. Among the examples of sustainable fashion which the Prince and Duchess admired during their tour were Danish brand Carcel which offers employment opportunities for women in prisons and is made with a commitment to zero waste. Prince Charles appeared particularly taken with a patchwork shirt by Outerknown, a label which uses recycled plastic and fishing nets in its production- perhaps an option for Saturday evening\u2019s wedding after-party? Royal wedding | Fashion and Beauty Later in the tour, Loehnis and Federico Marchetti, CEO of Yoox Net-a-Porter, demonstrated their vision for a new kind of homepage, powered by artificial intelligence. Bespoke web pages had been created for the Duchess, including suggestions of outfits she may like to wear for any upcoming garden parties or christenings. \u201cWe wanted to share with Their Royal Highnesses a very human side of technology. Today, our guests had the opportunity to see how artificial intelligence can be about warmth, beauty and craftsmanship,\u201d said Marchetti. The Duchess of Cornwall with schoolgirls taking part in the coding challenge Credit: Getty The Tech Hub tour culminated in Their Royal Highnesses meeting 60 girls from local schools in West London who were putting their coding skills to good use in a T-shirt design competition. The initiative which is a partnership between YNAP and Imperial College London aims to encourage more girls to pursue careers in technology. \u201cIt was great to energise the pupils by showing how coding can really impact products like t-shirts,\u201d observed Loehnis. Charles and Camilla are presented with Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter goodie bags Credit: Getty \u201cThey were curious about the brands which we\u2019d put together and I explained how sustainability is increasingly important to our customers,\u201d Loehnis later said of the visit. \u201cI introduced our newest category which is fine jewellery and watches, explaining how customers are now willing to make these big purchases through their smartphones.\u201d Perhaps not a predicament with the royals are familiar with, given their access to a vast collection of crown jewels and family heirlooms. As Charles and Camilla left \u00a0the YNAP Tech Hub, they were presented with three rather large bags containing gifts from Alexander McQueen and Turnbull and Asser. Could they be the perfect finishing touches to their outfits for Saturday\u2019s royal wedding?","published_at":1526484585,"content_id":"d2a34970-c419-3977-8be5-3613f67d53ec","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/apos-very-nice-stuff-apos-172200098.html","content_published_at":1526491320,"content_time":1526491320,"content_relative_time":2,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence","vibe_id":"106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":2,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"59f3296b-5e6c-3a13-80f2-044d48499a6d","post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-ce26f655-74f3-349a-bc9e-965c1ad9e3e9_a-59f3296b-5e6c-3a13-80f2-044d48499a6d","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-ce26f655-74f3-349a-bc9e-965c1ad9e3e9_a-59f3296b-5e6c-3a13-80f2-044d48499a6d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/google-uber-execs-top-guest-5oaj6gy","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Bloomberg","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/?cmpid=yhoo.logo","provider_image":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/284\/2011\/06\/08\/bloomberg-106x27_102102.gif","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/google-uber-execs-top-guest-125722873.html","imgresolutions":null,"img":null,"imgw":null,"imgh":null,"title":"Google, Uber Execs Top the Guest List for Macron's Tech Huddle","summary":"France\u2019s president wants to become the go-to head of state for global tech and will host the bosses of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google to Uber in Paris next week to talk about social responsibility, eyeing an opening as the industry\u2019s relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump proves complicated.

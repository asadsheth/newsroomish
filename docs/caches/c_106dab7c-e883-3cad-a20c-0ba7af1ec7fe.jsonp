and Macron take aim at Trump as German leader warns against 'national chauvinism' at Davos","summary":"Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron set out their vision for Europe as a counterweight to the values of Donald Trump\u2019s America at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. In her most pointed attack on President Trump\u2019s policies yet, Mrs Merkel told an audience of global business leaders gathered at the Swiss resort that \u201cprotectionism is not the answer\u201d and that judging people according to stereotypes is \u201cthe very basis of populism\u201d. She called for Europe to \u201ctake its destiny in its own hands\u201d with a more active and ambitious foreign policy. President Macron called for the European Union to reform itself this year and come up with a \u201c10-year strategic plan\u201d to compete with China and America. He called on the EU\u2019s 27 countries not to hold back the most \u201cambitious\u201d member states from moving forward. What the Davos elite really gets up to France \u201cis back at the core of Europe\u201d, Mr Macron said, as he trumpeted the liberal reforms he has enacted in the past eight months. Mrs Merkel struck a more sombre note, invoking the spectre of two world wars. The world leaders of a century ago had \u201csleepwalked\u201d into the First World War, she said. \u201cThe generation born after the Second World War must prove it has learned the lessons of history.\u201d \u201cWe see national chauvinism and populism on rise. In many countries there is a populist atmosphere. In all countries there are doubts about whether globalisation will carry everyone with it.\u201d Motoring picture of the day, January 25, 2018 \u2013 Trump lands at Davos But she insisted the answer did not lie in nationalism or isolation. \u201cMultilateralism is time-consuming. But it's worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we rely on the quick fix of the national solution, then others will respond with their own national solutions.\u201d President Trump had not yet arrived in Davos, and Mrs Merkel did not refer to him by name, but there was no mistaking the target of many of her remarks. \u201cIf we believe things are not fair, we have to seek multilateral answers, not pursue a unilateral protectionist course where we isolate ourselves,\u201d she said, just days after the Trump administration imposed punitive \u201cAmerica First\u201d tariffs on imports. Davos 2018 | Who's in Team Trump? She called for Europe to be more proactive in promoting its values and interests. \u201cEurope hasn\u2019t been very active in its foreign policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to take more responsibility. We need to take out destiny in our own hands.\u201d She regretted Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, she said, but at least it had given Europe \u201cthe courage to move forwards\u201d. She took a hard line on Brexit, reiterating her insistence the UK must accept freedom of movement if it wants access to the single market. \u201cIt\u2019s in their hands how close they want the partnership to be. We are prepared to be open-minded.\u201d It was an uncharacteristically powerful speech, and Mrs Merkel appeared to be trying to take back her mantle as Europe\u2019s leader, which has slipped in recent months. Macron joined Merkel in promoting European values Credit: Jason Alden\/\u00a0Bloomberg President Macron may be the darling of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, but for once he had to play second fiddle. Taking the podium after Mrs Merkel, he leapt to the defence of global free trade ahead of President Trump\u2019s arrival. \u201cIn terms of trade we're moving towards greater protectionism . . .\u00a0we're undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve,\u201d he said. However, after extolling his drive to foster risk-taking at home, he warned of the perils of \u201cDarwinian\u201d globalisation. He slammed a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d among states and companies who acted like \u201cillegal stowaways\u201d when it came to paying tax or respecting international rules. Speaking in French and English, he said their inability to agree on a \u201cglobal compact\u201d was threatening to create a \u201cfragmented world\u201d and the rise of nationalism. Davos World Economic Forum 2018 Digital giants, he said, were in the process of destroying \u201cmillions\u00a0 of jobs\u201d with artificial intelligence but failed to pay taxes in France to fund the education of the future workforce, whereas home-grown \u201cstart-ups\u201d do. \u201cIf those who destroy the jobs don't help - as to finance the re-training of people - how am I going to explain this to the working and middle classes?\u201d Mr Trump was not due to arrive in Davos until Thursday.

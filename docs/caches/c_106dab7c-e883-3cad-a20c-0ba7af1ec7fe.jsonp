That's science fiction'","summary":"Significant technological change is coming to British workplaces by 2030 but it won't be lead by an army of intelligent humanoid machines, according to the co-founder of a leading UK robotics start-up. Suryansh Chandra, of Automata, has issued a warning about overly dramatic predictions for the future of work. Speaking to Harry de Quetteville for the latest episode of the Technology Intelligence podcast he said, \"The definition of robots that society has evolved to see, which is this ultimate humanoid that is basically going to take care of the elderly, or do babysitting, or drive your car, or cook your breakfast - that's science fiction. That's not going to happen.\" His comments are at odds with a speech given recently by Governor of The Bank Of England, Mark Carney, who earlier this month said the rise of robotics and artificial intelligence could lead to the rise of Marxism. He told the Canada Growth Summit, \u201cThe benefits, from a worker\u2019s perspective, from the first industrial revolution, which began in the latter half of the 18th century, were not felt fully in productivity and wages until the latter half of the 19th century. \u201cIf you substitute platforms for textile mills, machine learning for steam engines, Twitter for the telegraph, you have exactly the same dynamics as existed 150 years ago \u2013 when Karl Marx was scribbling the Communist Manifesto.\u201d Chandra's company is taking advantage of rapidly advancing technologies to\u00a0develop\u00a0its own collaborative robots which it aims to make available to the mass market. With a team of less than 20 working on development at an office a few minutes from London's Silicon Roundabout, Chandra and his co-founder Mostafa Elsayed have produced a robotic arm which can be programmed via a smartphone or laptop in less than 15 minutes and costs less than five thousand pounds.\u00a0 Despite the company's goal of distributing robots to workshops, production lines, labs and classrooms around\u00a0the world, Chandra believes the impact on the way we work will be more of an evolution than a revolution. \"By 2030 I think at Automata we'd be super thrilled if something like a collaborative robot was seen in two ways. One, increasingly moving away from this concept of this technology that I can't access to just a tool. It's a thing you come in the morning, you pick it up and it starts doing its job - the same way that you think of your smartphone or your laptop. It enables you to do your job that day.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The other way is that it's expected that in fields like manufacturing that you have a robot co-worker. That doesn't mean that it's a humanoid walking around the factory, that's not what I mean, it's just that your day-to-day involves robots and if you look at something like Amazon's warehouses that is the case today. \"We believe those two versions of the future are possible in the next decade and the half. We're not going to be in the place where we have incredibly smart robots walking around. It's a marginal change to the way we work but it's definitely on an upwards trajectory of change. \" Elsayed told the podcast that most employees should not be fearful of robots rendering their own jobs obsolete.\u00a0 \"Robots should augment the workforce and enable staff to move on to more meaningful work instead of focusing on the menial task and let the robot focus on that.\" Although Chandra believes the near future looks relatively tame, he agrees with Mark Carney that the progress in artificial intelligence\u00a0makes the long-term outlook a lot more opaque. \"Robotic growth is increasing. The technology is advancing faster than ever before... Robotics is a transformative technology. Relative to where it can be, especially with what we're seeing in the fields of software development and machine learning, there is still a lot yet to come.\" To hear the full episode, The Future Of Work, download and subscribe to the Technology Intelligence podcast for free via Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

It's no exaggeration to say Maker has been one of the keys to the Bucks' resurgence after they fell into a 2-0 hole and","published_at":1524440685,"content_id":"67fb1a22-42ca-356d-bd2d-6154e117c8f7","content_url":"https:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/story\/sports\/nba\/bucks\/2018\/04\/22\/damato-bucks-thon-maker-impacts-series-high-octane-minutes\/529565002\/","content_published_at":1524440102,"content_time":1524440102,"content_relative_time":19,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":19,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44","post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-bef63c6b-45ce-33d2-9c31-8da0b310dd8c_a-ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-bef63c6b-45ce-33d2-9c31-8da0b310dd8c_a-ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-bef63c6b-45ce-33d2-9c31-8da0b310dd8c_a-ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"wtol.com","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.wtol.com\/story\/38014267\/ginobili-aldridge-help-spurs-beat-warriors-to-avoid-sweep","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/ddMT4XIoz51qeJedpSwg3w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/u2mCx0Aac6LKpqUOtdzKWA--\/dz00ODI7aD01MTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44-455802607.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XoZ6Tgl4A1G0qagk2zbztQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MTI7dz00ODI7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/u2mCx0Aac6LKpqUOtdzKWA--\/dz00ODI7aD01MTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44-455802607.jpeg","height":512,"width":482,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/u2mCx0Aac6LKpqUOtdzKWA--\/dz00ODI7aD01MTI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ad736257-6642-3ae7-a8f6-1ad558a0ab44-455802607.jpeg","imgw":482,"imgh":512,"title":"Ginobili, Aldridge help Spurs beat Warriors to avoid sweep","summary":"SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Manu Ginobili scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter of what could have been his final home game with the Spurs, and San Antonio beat the Golden State Warriors 103-90 on Sunday to avoid a series sweep as coach Gregg Popovich remained out following the death of his wife.

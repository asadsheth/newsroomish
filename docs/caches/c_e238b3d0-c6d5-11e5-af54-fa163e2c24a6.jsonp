The move raised eyebrows around the league and now Deng's contract is considered one of the most difficult to trade. With the team committed to building around their young core and hoping to find a new home for Deng, he played a total of 13 minutes during the 2017-18 campaign. All of them came in the season opener against the Clippers. It wasn't an easy situation for the veteran Deng, who has been used to being a key contributor over the course of his 14-year NBA career. Unfortunately, Deng's massive contract, and the complications it brings to the team's salary cap, has made him a target for

In the first-person essay, Oladipo writes about the immediate aftermath of being traded to the Pacers and his excitement about the chance to get to play in Indiana again. \"I wasn't going to just another team. I was coming home,\" writes Oladipo. Oladipo played three years at Indiana University before turning pro. Since joining the league, Oladipo has taken note of the warm reception he received at Bankers Life Fieldhouse as a member of the visiting Magic and Thunder.

He's a challenge for any player to defend, and when he's getting away with the move below, he's impossible. During Game 1 of the Rockets' first-round matchup with the Timberwolves, Harden broke down Andrew Wiggins off the dribble and knocked down a step-back 3. The footwork was incredible. It was also a blatant travel. Harden took four steps back after he picked up his dribble. It was done quickly, and it wasn't called. NBA fans certainly took notice, though. They all had the same reaction. But let's be realistic - no NBA ref is going to call that a travel.
